Summoned by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], it was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King. This signaled the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].\n\n== The decision to summon the Estates ==\n\n=== First Assembly of Notables and peasants ===\nThe suggestion to summon the Estates General came from the [[Assembly of Notables]] installed by the King on 22 February 1787. This institution had not been called [[Estates General (France)|since 1614]]. In 1787, the [[Parlement of Paris]] was refusing to ratify [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]]'s program of badly needed financial reform, due to the special interests of its noble members. Calonne was the Controller-General of Finances, appointed by the King to address the state deficit. As a last measure, Calonne was hoping to bypass them by reviving the archaic institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=63}}</ref> The initial roster of Notables included 137 nobles, among them many future revolutionaries, such as the [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], known at this time for his central role in the [[American Revolution]]. Calonne received little cooperation from the assembly, being dismissed on April 8, 1787 and banished shortly after for proposing a 'Subvention Territoriale', or land tax. He continued to comment on the French political scene from London.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=63\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne]], President of the Assembly of Notables, succeeded Calonne as the Controller-General of Finances. He was offered the post of Prime Minister,{{By whom|date=September 2019}} which was to include being Controller. The Notables nevertheless remained recalcitrant. They made a number of proposals but they would not grant the King money. Lafayette suggested that the problem required a national assembly. Brienne asked him if he meant the Estates General. On receiving an affirmative answer, Brienne recorded it as a proposal. Frustrated by his inability to obtain money, the King staged a day-long harangue, and then on 25 May dissolved the Notables. Their proposals reverted to the Parlement.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=70\u201373}}</ref>\n\n=== Rebellion of the Parlements ===\nTurning again to the parlements, the king found that they were inclined to continue the issues that had been raised in the Assembly of Notables. Their proper legal function, besides giving advice to the king, was only to register, or record, his edicts as law, a matter of simple obedience, which the king's antecessors had been able to command, sometimes by sternness, threats, and losses of temper. Unless registered, the edicts were not lawful.\n\nOn 6 July 1787, Lom\u00e9nie forwarded the ''Subvention Territoriale'' and another tax, the ''Edit du Timbre'', or \"Stamp Act,\" based on the American model, for registration. The parlement refused to register an illegal act, demanding accounting statements, or \"States,\" as a prior condition. It was the king's turn to refuse. The members of the parlement insisted that they required either the accounting States or a meeting of the Estates General. The king would not let this slight to his authority pass and commanded the parlement to assemble at Versailles, where on 6 August he [[Lit de justice|ordered them in person]] to register the taxes. On 7 August back in Paris, parlement declared in earnest this time the order to be null and void, repudiating all previous registrations of taxes. Only the Estates General, they said, could register taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nFor the second time, the king summoned the parlement away from Paris, where crowds of people cheered their every act from the street, this time to meet at Troyes, Champagne on 15 August. He did not personally appear. By messenger he and the parlement negotiated an agreement: the king withdrew the Stamp Tax and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title in return for the assured registration of further loans. The parlement was allowed to return on 20 September. Encouraged, Lom\u00e9nie, with the support of the king, went beyond what was agreed to by parlement\u2014the granting of specific loans. He proposed an Emprunt Successif (Successive Loan) until 1792 giving the king a [[blank cheque]]. When parlement delayed, the king resorted to a ruse; he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November. On that day at 11:00 AM the king and his peers noisily entered the session of parlement dressed in hunting clothes. They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately, they said.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=81\u201384}}</ref>\n\nNearly the entire government was now face-to-face. They argued the problems and issues concerned until dusk, some six hours later. Parlement believed that the problem had gone beyond the government and needed the decisions of the Estates General which did not correspond to the king's concept of monarchy. At the end of the day, the king demanded the registration of the Successive Loan. The [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans]] (a previous Notable, a relative of the king, and an ardent revolutionary), known as ''Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9'', asked if this were a Royal Session of the Peers or a Session of Parlement. On being told it was a Royal Session he replied that edicts were not registered at Royal Sessions. The king retorted, ''Vous \u00eates bien le ma\u00eetre'' (do as YOU will) with some sarcasm as the king's will was legally required, and strode angrily from the session with a retinue. ''[[Lettre de cachet|Lettres de Cachet]],'' or arbitrary arrest warrants, followed on the 20th for D'Orleans and two others. They were taken into custody and held under comfortable conditions away from Paris; D'Orleans on his country estate. Parlement began a debate on the legality of ''chicken''. The men being held became a ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.''<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=85}}</ref>\n\nAs the king and parlement could accomplish no more together, De Brienne, over the winter, pressed for an alternative plan; to resurrect even more archaic institutions. The ''Grand Bailliages,'' or larger legal jurisdictions that once had existed, would assume parlements' legal functions, while the Plenary Court, last known under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], when it had the power to register edicts, would assume the registration duties of the parlements, leaving them with no duties to perform. The king planned a sudden revelation and dismissal of parlement. However, [[Jean-Jacques Duval d'Epr\u00e9mesnil]] heard the government presses running and bribed the printer to give him the proofs of the edict. Hearing it read the next day, 3 May 1788, parlement swore an oath not to be disbanded and defined a manifesto of their rights.\n\nWarrants were issued for d'Epr\u00e9mesnil and another but they escaped from their homes over the rooftops in the early morning to seek refuge in parlement. The king sent his guards to arrest them, and they surrendered. Parlement filed silently out between a line of guards. The commander gave the key to the building to the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=86\u201395}}</ref>\n\n=== The Jacobins ===\nThe transfer of power to the new government was to begin on 8 May 1788 with the registration of the edicts establishing it in the regional Parlement. The latter refused unanimously following the Parlement of Paris. If the King's commissioners forced the issue Parlement abandoned the meeting place only to return the next day to declare the registration null and void. Armed protest swept the kingdom. Street fighting broke out at [[Rennes]], Brittany. A deputation sent to Paris from there was imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. The [[Breton people|Bretons]] in Paris founded the [[Club Breton|Breton Club]], later renamed the [[Jacobin]] Society. The Grand Bailliages could not be created and the Plenary Court met only once.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=95\u201397}}</ref>\n\n== Convening the Estates-General ==\n\n=== Edict of 24 January 1789 ===\nThe Estates-General were summoned by a royal edict dated to 24 January 1789. It comprised two parts: a ''Lettre du Roi,'' and a ''R\u00e8glement''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Louis XVI |year=1789 |title=Lettre du Roi pour la Convocation des \u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux a Versailles, le 27 Avril, 1789, et R\u00e8glement y Annex\u00e9 |publisher=L'Imprimerie Royale |location=Paris |page=3 |url=https://archive.org/details/mdu-rare-027042 |quote=Nous avons besoin du concours de nos fid\u00e8les Sujets, pour nous aider \u00e0 surmonter toutes les difficult\u00e9s o\u00f9 nous nous trouvons relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de nos finances ....

These great motives have resolved us to convoke the ''assembl\u00e9e des \u00c9tats'' of all the provinces under our authority ....\"\n\nThe King promises to address the grievances of his people. The \"most notable persons\" of each community and judicial district are summoned \"to confer and to record remonstrances, complaints, and grievances.\" Elections for Deputies are to be held. He says that he intends \"reform of abuse,\" \"establishment of a fixed and durable order,\" and \"general prosperity.\" The ''Lettre'' is signed \"Louis.\"\n\n''Lettres de Convocation'' were sent to all the provinces with the ''R\u00e8glement'' prescribing the methods of election. During the preceding autumn the Parlement of Paris, an aristocratic advisory body to the King, had decided that the organization of the convention would be the same as in 1614, the last time the Estates had met. As 175 years had gone by since then it is clear the Estates were not a functional institution in French society. By reviving them as much as possible like they had been the King and the Parlement intended to control the authority of the people. The previous Estates had voted by order; that is, the Nobles and the Clergy could together outvote the Commons by 2 to 1.\n\nIf on the other hand, each delegate were to have one vote, the majority would prevail. The issue was widely discussed in the press during the autumn of 1788. The people would nevertheless accept any national convention confident that enough members of the Nobility and the Clergy would be with them to sway the votes. A National Party was formed. It argued that France had never had a constitution and the proper function of the Convention was to establish one. The royalist defenders, however, accepted the absolute monarchy as the constitution. Just to be certain the press began to demand that the Commons be allocated twice as many delegates as each of the other two Estates. In an attempt to bolster his failing popularity the King acceded to this measure of \"doubling the Third.\" He was confident of his influence over the Nobility and Clergy.<ref>The analysis of the preceding two paragraphs is that of {{harvnb|Neely|2008|pp=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\n=== Elections of early Spring 1789 ===\nThe First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10 percent of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) from peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.<ref>William Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p. 59</ref>  The Second Estate represented the\nnobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25 percent of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of the 282 deputies representing the Second Estate were landed, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 578 men, representing 95 percent of the population of roughly 25 million. Half were well-educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.<ref>{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=William |date=1989 |title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution |edition= |isbn= |pages=99\u2013101}}</ref>{{edition needed|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Soboul |first=Albert |date=1975 |title=The French Revolution 1787\u20131799: From the Storming of the Bastille to Napoleon |publisher=Random House |isbn=0394473922 |pages=127\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''R\u00e8glement'' that went out by post in January thus specified separate voting for delegates of each Estate. Each tax district (cities, boroughs, and parishes) would elect their own delegates to the Third Estate. The ''Bailliages'', or judicial districts, would elect delegates to the First and Second Estates in separate ballots. Each voting assembly would also collect a ''Cahier'', or \"Notebook\", of grievances to be considered by the Convocation. The election rules differed somewhat depending on the type of voting unit, whether city, parish or some other. Generally, the distribution of delegates was by population: the most populous locations had the greatest number of delegates. The City of Paris was thus dominant. The electorate consisted of males 25 years and older, property owners, and registered taxpayers. They could be native or naturalized citizens.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Boyer | first1=John W. | last2=Kirshner | first2=Julius | year=1986|editor1-link=Keith Michael Baker | editor1-first=Keith Michael | editor1-last=Baker | title=From Reform to Revolution | work=The Old Regime and the French Revolution | series=University of Chicago readings in Western civilization | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=180\u201384}}</ref>\n\nThe number of delegates elected was about 1,200, half of whom formed the Third Estate. The First and Second Estates had 300 each. But French society had changed since 1614, and these Estates-General were not identical to those of 1614. Members of the nobility were not required to stand for election to the Second Estate, and many of them were elected to the Third Estate. The total number of nobles in the three Estates was about 400. Noble representatives of the Third Estate were among the most passionate revolutionaries in attendance, including [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and the [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]]. Despite their status as elected representatives of the Third Estate, many of these nobles were executed by guillotine during the Terror.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Guttner |first=Darius |year=2015 |title=The French Revolution |publisher=Nelson Cengage |isbn=9780170243995 |page=225}}</ref>\n\nThe Nobles in the Second Estate were the richest and most powerful in the kingdom. The King could count on them, but that was of little use to him in the succeeding course of history. He had also expected that the First Estate would be predominantly the noble Bishops. The electorate, however, returned mainly parish priests, most of whom were sympathetic to the Commons. The Third Estate elections returned predominantly magistrates and lawyers. The lower levels of society, the landless, working men, though present in large numbers in street gangs, were totally absent from the Estates-General, as the King had called for \"the most notable persons\".\n\nThe grievances returned were mainly about taxes, which the people considered a crushing burden.<ref>Schwab, Gail M.; Jeanneney, John R. (1995).

Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> Consequently, the people and the King were totally at odds from the very beginning. Aristocratic privilege was also attacked. The people resented the fact that nobles could excuse themselves from most of the burden of taxation and service that fell on the ordinary people. A third type complained that the ubiquitous tolls and duties levied by the nobility hindered internal commerce.<ref>Elections results come from {{harvnb|Neely|2008|pp=61\u201363}}</ref>\n\n=== Opening of the Convention ===\nOn 5 May 1789,<ref>Dyer, Thomas Henry; Hassall, Arthur (1901).

Bell and sons.</ref> amidst general festivities, the Estates-General convened in an elaborate but temporary ''\u00cele des \u00c9tats'' set up in one of the courtyards of the official [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|H\u00f4tel des Menus Plaisirs]] in the town of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] near the royal [[ch\u00e2teau]]. With the ''\u00e9tiquette'' of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and [[Charles Louis Fran\u00e7ois de Paule de Barentin]], the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting \"by orders\", i.e. that the collective vote of each estate would be weighed equally.\n\nThe apparent intent of the King and of Barentin was for everyone to get directly to the matter of taxes. The larger representation of the Third Estate would remain merely a symbol while giving them no extra power. Director-General of Finance [[Jacques Necker]] had more sympathy for the Third Estate, but on this occasion he spoke only about the fiscal situation, leaving it to Barentin to speak on how the Estates-General was to operate.\n\nTrying to avoid the issue of representation and to focus solely on taxes, the King and his ministers had gravely misjudged the situation. The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed \u2013 correctly, as history was to prove \u2013 that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King. Necker sympathized with the Third Estate in this matter, but the astute financier lacked equal astuteness as a politician. He decided to let the ''impasse'' play out to the point of stalemate before he would enter the fray. As a result, by the time the King yielded to the demand of the Third Estate, it seemed to all to be a concession wrung from the monarchy, rather than a magnanimous gift that would have convinced the populace of the King's goodwill.<ref>[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section2.rhtml SparkNotes: ''the French Revolution'' (1789\u20131799): ''The Estates-General'': 1789]</ref>\n\n==Proceedings and dissolution==\n\nThe Estates-General reached an impasse. The Second Estate pushed for meetings that were to transpire in three separate locations, as they had traditionally. The [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]], a noble himself but elected to represent the Third Estate, tried but failed to keep all three orders in a single room for this discussion. Instead of discussing the King's taxes, the three estates began to discuss separately the organization of the legislature. These efforts continued without success until 27 May, when the nobles voted to stand firm for each estate to verify its members separately. The following day, the [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]] (a senior member of the clergy, but, like Mirabeau, elected to represent the Third Estate) moved that the representatives of the Third Estate, who now called themselves the ''Communes'' (\"Commons\"), proceed with verification and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them.\n\nOn 13 June 1789, the Third Estate had arrived at a resolution to examine and settle the powers of the three orders. They invited the clergy and nobles to work with them on this endeavor. On 17 June, with the failure of efforts to reconcile the three estates, the ''Communes'' completed their own process of verification and almost immediately voted a measure far more radical: they declared themselves redefined as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the estates, but of the people. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear that they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. As their numbers exceeded the combined numbers of the other estates, they could dominate any combined assembly in which issues were decided based on majority or supermajority votes of its members, rather than the traditional arrangement giving equal decision-making power to each of the three Estates. The Third Estate balked at this traditional arrangement, because the clergy and nobility were more conservative than the commoners and could overrule the Third Estate on any matter 2\u20131. The Third Estate had initially demanded to be granted double weight, allowing them to match the power of the First and Second Estates, but those estates had refused to accept this proposal.\n\nThe King attempted to resist this reorganization of the Estates-General. On the advice of the courtiers of his [[privy council]], he resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 20 June, he ordered the hall where the National Assembly met to be closed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Robert R. |year=2016 |title=The World of the French Revolution |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1317189565 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6alTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tennis%20Court%20Oath&f=false}}</ref> The Assembly then went in search of a building large enough to hold them, taking their deliberations to the nearby [[Jeu de paume|tennis]] court, where they proceeded to swear the '[[Tennis Court Oath]]', agreeing not to disband until they had settled the constitution of France. Two days later, deprived of the use of the tennis court as well, the Assembly met in the [[Versailles Cathedral|Church of Saint Louis]], where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events.\n\nIn the ''s\u00e9ance royale'' of 23 June, the King announced a ''Charte octroy\u00e9e'', a constitution granted by royal favor, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move too failed; soon, at the request of the King, those representatives of the nobility who still stood apart also joined the National Assembly. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (after 9 July 1789, renamed the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Carlyle |year=1902 |title=The French Revolution: a History |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7ROD7X3GzjAC}}\n*  Doyle, William.

Summoned by [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], it was brought to an end when the Third Estate formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], inviting the other two to join, against the wishes of the King. This signaled the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].\n\n== The decision to summon the Estates ==\n\n=== First Assembly of Notables and peasants ===\nThe suggestion to summon the Estates General came from the [[Assembly of Notables]] installed by the King on 22 February 1787. This institution had not been called [[Estates General (France)|since 1614]]. In 1787, the [[Parlement of Paris]] was refusing to ratify [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne]]'s program of badly needed financial reform, due to the special interests of its noble members. Calonne was the Controller-General of Finances, appointed by the King to address the state deficit. As a last measure, Calonne was hoping to bypass them by reviving the archaic institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=63}}</ref> The initial roster of Notables included 137 nobles, among them many future revolutionaries, such as the [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], known at this time for his central role in the [[American Revolution]]. Calonne received little cooperation from the assembly, being dismissed on April 8, 1787 and banished shortly after for proposing a 'Subvention Territoriale', or land tax. He continued to comment on the French political scene from London.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=63\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne]], President of the Assembly of Notables, succeeded Calonne as the Controller-General of Finances. He was offered the post of Prime Minister,{{By whom|date=September 2019}} which was to include being Controller. The Notables nevertheless remained recalcitrant. They made a number of proposals but they would not grant the King money. Lafayette suggested that the problem required a national assembly. Brienne asked him if he meant the Estates General. On receiving an affirmative answer, Brienne recorded it as a proposal. Frustrated by his inability to obtain money, the King staged a day-long harangue, and then on 25 May dissolved the Notables. Their proposals reverted to the Parlement.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=70\u201373}}</ref>\n\n=== Rebellion of the Parlements ===\nTurning again to the parlements, the king found that they were inclined to continue the issues that had been raised in the Assembly of Notables. Their proper legal function, besides giving advice to the king, was only to register, or record, his edicts as law, a matter of simple obedience, which the king's antecessors had been able to command, sometimes by sternness, threats, and losses of temper. Unless registered, the edicts were not lawful.\n\nOn 6 July 1787, Lom\u00e9nie forwarded the ''Subvention Territoriale'' and another tax, the ''Edit du Timbre'', or \"Stamp Act,\" based on the American model, for registration. The parlement refused to register an illegal act, demanding accounting statements, or \"States,\" as a prior condition. It was the king's turn to refuse. The members of the parlement insisted that they required either the accounting States or a meeting of the Estates General. The king would not let this slight to his authority pass and commanded the parlement to assemble at Versailles, where on 6 August he [[Lit de justice|ordered them in person]] to register the taxes. On 7 August back in Paris, parlement declared in earnest this time the order to be null and void, repudiating all previous registrations of taxes. Only the Estates General, they said, could register taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\nFor the second time, the king summoned the parlement away from Paris, where crowds of people cheered their every act from the street, this time to meet at Troyes, Champagne on 15 August. He did not personally appear. By messenger he and the parlement negotiated an agreement: the king withdrew the Stamp Tax and modified the Land Tax to exclude the lands of people of title in return for the assured registration of further loans. The parlement was allowed to return on 20 September. Encouraged, Lom\u00e9nie, with the support of the king, went beyond what was agreed to by parlement\u2014the granting of specific loans. He proposed an Emprunt Successif (Successive Loan) until 1792 giving the king a [[blank cheque]]. When parlement delayed, the king resorted to a ruse; he scheduled a Royal Hunt for 19 November. On that day at 11:00 AM the king and his peers noisily entered the session of parlement dressed in hunting clothes. They would confer with each other and have the decisions registered immediately, they said.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=81\u201384}}</ref>\n\nNearly the entire government was now face-to-face. They argued the problems and issues concerned until dusk, some six hours later. Parlement believed that the problem had gone beyond the government and needed the decisions of the Estates General which did not correspond to the king's concept of monarchy. At the end of the day, the king demanded the registration of the Successive Loan. The [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans]] (a previous Notable, a relative of the king, and an ardent revolutionary), known as ''Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9'', asked if this were a Royal Session of the Peers or a Session of Parlement. On being told it was a Royal Session he replied that edicts were not registered at Royal Sessions. The king retorted, ''Vous \u00eates bien le ma\u00eetre'' (do as YOU will) with some sarcasm as the king's will was legally required, and strode angrily from the session with a retinue. ''[[Lettre de cachet|Lettres de Cachet]],'' or arbitrary arrest warrants, followed on the 20th for D'Orleans and two others. They were taken into custody and held under comfortable conditions away from Paris; D'Orleans on his country estate. Parlement began a debate on the legality of ''chicken''. The men being held became a ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.''<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|p=85}}</ref>\n\nAs the king and parlement could accomplish no more together, De Brienne, over the winter, pressed for an alternative plan; to resurrect even more archaic institutions. The ''Grand Bailliages,'' or larger legal jurisdictions that once had existed, would assume parlements' legal functions, while the Plenary Court, last known under [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], when it had the power to register edicts, would assume the registration duties of the parlements, leaving them with no duties to perform. The king planned a sudden revelation and dismissal of parlement. However, [[Jean-Jacques Duval d'Epr\u00e9mesnil]] heard the government presses running and bribed the printer to give him the proofs of the edict. Hearing it read the next day, 3 May 1788, parlement swore an oath not to be disbanded and defined a manifesto of their rights.\n\nWarrants were issued for d'Epr\u00e9mesnil and another but they escaped from their homes over the rooftops in the early morning to seek refuge in parlement. The king sent his guards to arrest them, and they surrendered. Parlement filed silently out between a line of guards. The commander gave the key to the building to the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=86\u201395}}</ref>\n\n=== The Jacobins ===\nThe transfer of power to the new government was to begin on 8 May 1788 with the registration of the edicts establishing it in the regional Parlement. The latter refused unanimously following the Parlement of Paris. If the King's commissioners forced the issue Parlement abandoned the meeting place only to return the next day to declare the registration null and void. Armed protest swept the kingdom. Street fighting broke out at [[Rennes]], Brittany. A deputation sent to Paris from there was imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. The [[Breton people|Bretons]] in Paris founded the [[Club Breton|Breton Club]], later renamed the [[Jacobin]] Society. The Grand Bailliages could not be created and the Plenary Court met only once.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlyle|1902|pp=95\u201397}}</ref>\n\n== Convening the Estates-General ==\n\n=== Edict of 24 January 1789 ===\nThe Estates-General were summoned by a royal edict dated to 24 January 1789. It comprised two parts: a ''Lettre du Roi,'' and a ''R\u00e8glement''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Louis XVI |year=1789 |title=Lettre du Roi pour la Convocation des \u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux a Versailles, le 27 Avril, 1789, et R\u00e8glement y Annex\u00e9 |publisher=L'Imprimerie Royale |location=Paris |page=3 |url=https://archive.org/details/mdu-rare-027042 |quote=Nous avons besoin du concours de nos fid\u00e8les Sujets, pour nous aider \u00e0 surmonter toutes les difficult\u00e9s o\u00f9 nous nous trouvons relativement \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de nos finances ....

The \"most notable persons\" of each community and judicial district are summoned \"to confer and to record remonstrances, complaints, and grievances.\" Elections for Deputies are to be held. He says that he intends \"reform of abuse,\" \"establishment of a fixed and durable order,\" and \"general prosperity.\" The ''Lettre'' is signed \"Louis.\"\n\n''Lettres de Convocation'' were sent to all the provinces with the ''R\u00e8glement'' prescribing the methods of election. During the preceding autumn the Parlement of Paris, an aristocratic advisory body to the King, had decided that the organization of the convention would be the same as in 1614, the last time the Estates had met. As 175 years had gone by since then it is clear the Estates were not a functional institution in French society. By reviving them as much as possible like they had been the King and the Parlement intended to control the authority of the people. The previous Estates had voted by order; that is, the Nobles and the Clergy could together outvote the Commons by 2 to 1.\n\nIf on the other hand, each delegate were to have one vote, the majority would prevail. The issue was widely discussed in the press during the autumn of 1788. The people would nevertheless accept any national convention confident that enough members of the Nobility and the Clergy would be with them to sway the votes. A National Party was formed. It argued that France had never had a constitution and the proper function of the Convention was to establish one. The royalist defenders, however, accepted the absolute monarchy as the constitution. Just to be certain the press began to demand that the Commons be allocated twice as many delegates as each of the other two Estates. In an attempt to bolster his failing popularity the King acceded to this measure of \"doubling the Third.\" He was confident of his influence over the Nobility and Clergy.<ref>The analysis of the preceding two paragraphs is that of {{harvnb|Neely|2008|pp=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\n=== Elections of early Spring 1789 ===\nThe First Estate represented 100,000 Catholic clergy; the Church owned about 10 percent of the land and collected its own taxes (the tithe) from peasants. The lands were controlled by bishops and abbots of monasteries, but two-thirds of the 303 delegates from the First Estate were ordinary parish priests; only 51 were bishops.<ref>William Doyle, '' The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) p. 59</ref>  The Second Estate represented the\nnobility, about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25 percent of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their peasant tenants. About a third of the 282 deputies representing the Second Estate were landed, mostly with minor holdings. The Third Estate representation was doubled to 578 men, representing 95 percent of the population of roughly 25 million. Half were well-educated lawyers or local officials. Nearly a third were in trades or industry; 51 were wealthy land owners.<ref>{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=William |date=1989 |title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution |edition= |isbn= |pages=99\u2013101}}</ref>{{edition needed|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Soboul |first=Albert |date=1975 |title=The French Revolution 1787\u20131799: From the Storming of the Bastille to Napoleon |publisher=Random House |isbn=0394473922 |pages=127\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe ''R\u00e8glement'' that went out by post in January thus specified separate voting for delegates of each Estate. Each tax district (cities, boroughs, and parishes) would elect their own delegates to the Third Estate. The ''Bailliages'', or judicial districts, would elect delegates to the First and Second Estates in separate ballots. Each voting assembly would also collect a ''Cahier'', or \"Notebook\", of grievances to be considered by the Convocation. The election rules differed somewhat depending on the type of voting unit, whether city, parish or some other. Generally, the distribution of delegates was by population: the most populous locations had the greatest number of delegates. The City of Paris was thus dominant. The electorate consisted of males 25 years and older, property owners, and registered taxpayers. They could be native or naturalized citizens.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Boyer | first1=John W. | last2=Kirshner | first2=Julius | year=1986|editor1-link=Keith Michael Baker | editor1-first=Keith Michael | editor1-last=Baker | title=From Reform to Revolution | work=The Old Regime and the French Revolution | series=University of Chicago readings in Western civilization | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=180\u201384}}</ref>\n\nThe number of delegates elected was about 1,200, half of whom formed the Third Estate. The First and Second Estates had 300 each. But French society had changed since 1614, and these Estates-General were not identical to those of 1614. Members of the nobility were not required to stand for election to the Second Estate, and many of them were elected to the Third Estate. The total number of nobles in the three Estates was about 400. Noble representatives of the Third Estate were among the most passionate revolutionaries in attendance, including [[Jean Joseph Mounier]] and the [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|comte de Mirabeau]]. Despite their status as elected representatives of the Third Estate, many of these nobles were executed by guillotine during the Terror.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Guttner |first=Darius |year=2015 |title=The French Revolution |publisher=Nelson Cengage |isbn=9780170243995 |page=225}}</ref>\n\nThe Nobles in the Second Estate were the richest and most powerful in the kingdom. The King could count on them, but that was of little use to him in the succeeding course of history. He had also expected that the First Estate would be predominantly the noble Bishops. The electorate, however, returned mainly parish priests, most of whom were sympathetic to the Commons. The Third Estate elections returned predominantly magistrates and lawyers. The lower levels of society, the landless, working men, though present in large numbers in street gangs, were totally absent from the Estates-General, as the King had called for \"the most notable persons\".\n\nThe grievances returned were mainly about taxes, which the people considered a crushing burden.<ref>Schwab, Gail M.; Jeanneney, John R. (1995).

Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> Consequently, the people and the King were totally at odds from the very beginning. Aristocratic privilege was also attacked. The people resented the fact that nobles could excuse themselves from most of the burden of taxation and service that fell on the ordinary people.

Bell and sons.</ref> amidst general festivities, the Estates-General convened in an elaborate but temporary ''\u00cele des \u00c9tats'' set up in one of the courtyards of the official [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|H\u00f4tel des Menus Plaisirs]] in the town of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] near the royal [[ch\u00e2teau]]. With the ''\u00e9tiquette'' of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and [[Charles Louis Fran\u00e7ois de Paule de Barentin]], the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting \"by orders\", i.e. that the collective vote of each estate would be weighed equally.\n\nThe apparent intent of the King and of Barentin was for everyone to get directly to the matter of taxes. The larger representation of the Third Estate would remain merely a symbol while giving them no extra power. Director-General of Finance [[Jacques Necker]] had more sympathy for the Third Estate, but on this occasion he spoke only about the fiscal situation, leaving it to Barentin to speak on how the Estates-General was to operate.\n\nTrying to avoid the issue of representation and to focus solely on taxes, the King and his ministers had gravely misjudged the situation. The Third Estate wanted the estates to meet as one body and for each delegate to have one vote. The other two estates, while having their own grievances against royal absolutism, believed \u2013 correctly, as history was to prove \u2013 that they stood to lose more power to the Third Estate than they stood to gain from the King. Necker sympathized with the Third Estate in this matter, but the astute financier lacked equal astuteness as a politician. He decided to let the ''impasse'' play out to the point of stalemate before he would enter the fray. As a result, by the time the King yielded to the demand of the Third Estate, it seemed to all to be a concession wrung from the monarchy, rather than a magnanimous gift that would have convinced the populace of the King's goodwill.<ref>[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/european/frenchrev/section2.rhtml SparkNotes: ''the French Revolution'' (1789\u20131799): ''The Estates-General'': 1789]</ref>\n\n==Proceedings and dissolution==\n\nThe Estates-General reached an impasse. The Second Estate pushed for meetings that were to transpire in three separate locations, as they had traditionally. The [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]], a noble himself but elected to represent the Third Estate, tried but failed to keep all three orders in a single room for this discussion. Instead of discussing the King's taxes, the three estates began to discuss separately the organization of the legislature. These efforts continued without success until 27 May, when the nobles voted to stand firm for each estate to verify its members separately. The following day, the [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s]] (a senior member of the clergy, but, like Mirabeau, elected to represent the Third Estate) moved that the representatives of the Third Estate, who now called themselves the ''Communes'' (\"Commons\"), proceed with verification and invite the other two estates to take part, but not to wait for them.\n\nOn 13 June 1789, the Third Estate had arrived at a resolution to examine and settle the powers of the three orders. They invited the clergy and nobles to work with them on this endeavor. On 17 June, with the failure of efforts to reconcile the three estates, the ''Communes'' completed their own process of verification and almost immediately voted a measure far more radical: they declared themselves redefined as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], an assembly not of the estates, but of the people. They invited the other orders to join them, but made it clear that they intended to conduct the nation's affairs with or without them. As their numbers exceeded the combined numbers of the other estates, they could dominate any combined assembly in which issues were decided based on majority or supermajority votes of its members, rather than the traditional arrangement giving equal decision-making power to each of the three Estates. The Third Estate balked at this traditional arrangement, because the clergy and nobility were more conservative than the commoners and could overrule the Third Estate on any matter 2\u20131. The Third Estate had initially demanded to be granted double weight, allowing them to match the power of the First and Second Estates, but those estates had refused to accept this proposal.\n\nThe King attempted to resist this reorganization of the Estates-General. On the advice of the courtiers of his [[privy council]], he resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On 20 June, he ordered the hall where the National Assembly met to be closed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Robert R. |year=2016 |title=The World of the French Revolution |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1317189565 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6alTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Tennis%20Court%20Oath&f=false}}</ref> The Assembly then went in search of a building large enough to hold them, taking their deliberations to the nearby [[Jeu de paume|tennis]] court, where they proceeded to swear the '[[Tennis Court Oath]]', agreeing not to disband until they had settled the constitution of France. Two days later, deprived of the use of the tennis court as well, the Assembly met in the [[Versailles Cathedral|Church of Saint Louis]], where the majority of the representatives of the clergy joined them: efforts to restore the old order had served only to accelerate events.\n\nIn the ''s\u00e9ance royale'' of 23 June, the King announced a ''Charte octroy\u00e9e'', a constitution granted by royal favor, which affirmed, subject to the traditional limitations, the right of separate deliberation for the three orders, which constitutionally formed three chambers. This move too failed; soon, at the request of the King, those representatives of the nobility who still stood apart also joined the National Assembly. The Estates-General had ceased to exist, having become the National Assembly (after 9 July 1789, renamed the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Carlyle |year=1902 |title=The French Revolution: a History |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_7ROD7X3GzjAC}}\n*  Doyle, William.

He became an influential dissident within the Roman Catholic priesthood during the 14th century and is considered an important predecessor to [[Protestantism]].\n\nWycliffe attacked the privileged status of the clergy, which had bolstered their powerful role in England. He then attacked the luxury and pomp of local parishes and their ceremonies.<ref>Lacey Baldwin Smith, ''This Realm of England: 1399 to 1688'' (3rd ed. 1976), p. 41</ref>\n\nWycliffe also advocated translation of the Bible into the [[vernacular]]. In 1382 he completed a translation directly from the [[Vulgate]] into [[Middle English]] \u2013 a version now known as [[Wycliffe's Bible]]. It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John| John]]; and it is possible he translated the entire [[New Testament]], while his associates translated the [[Old Testament]]. Wycliffe's Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe's assistant [[John Purvey]] and others in 1388 and 1395.\n\nWycliffe's followers, known as [[Lollards]], followed his lead in advocating [[predestination]], [[iconoclasm]], and the notion of [[caesaropapism]], while attacking the [[veneration of saints]], the [[sacraments]], [[requiem mass]]es, [[transubstantiation]], [[monasticism]], and the very existence of the [[Pope|Papacy]].\n\nIn the 16th century and beyond, the Lollard movement was sometimes regarded as the precursor to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Wycliffe was accordingly characterised as the evening star of [[scholasticism]] and as the [[Eosphoros|morning star]] of the [[English Reformation]].<ref>Emily Michael, \"John Wyclif on body and mind\", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (2003) p 343.</ref> Wycliffe's writings in Latin greatly influenced the philosophy and teaching of the Czech reformer [[Jan Hus]] ({{circa}} 1369\u20131415), whose execution in 1415 sparked a revolt and led to the [[Hussite Wars]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07584b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Jan Hus|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\nof 1419\u20131434.\n\n== Early life ==\nWycliffe was born in the village of [[Hipswell]] near [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], England, around the 1320s{{Efn |He has conventionally been given a birth date of 1324 but Hudson and Kenny state only records \"suggest he was born in the mid-1320s\"<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Oxford | title = Dictionary of National Biography}}.</ref> Conti simply states that he was born \"before 1330\".<ref name=\"Conti\">{{cite web |last1=Conti |first1=Alessandro |title=John Wyclif |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wyclif/ |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=3 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>}} His family was long settled in Yorkshire.

''Oxford \u2013 Images & Recollections, p. 261. {{ISBN|1-86982499-7}}.</ref> That same year he produced a small treatise, ''The Last Age of the Church''. In the light of the virulence of the plague that had subsided only seven years previously, Wycliffe's studies led him to the opinion that the close of the 14th century would mark the end of the world. While other writers viewed the plague as God's judgment on sinful people, Wycliffe saw it as an indictment of an unworthy clergy. The mortality rate among the clergy had been particularly high, and those who replaced them were, in his opinion, uneducated or generally disreputable.<ref name=Murray/>\n\nHe was [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] in 1361.<ref>{{cite web |title= Archives & Manuscripts |url= http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/History/masters.asp |publisher= Balliol College | place = Oxford | accessdate= 22 August 2009}}</ref> In this same year, he was presented by the college to the parish of [[Fillingham]] in [[Lincolnshire]], which he visited rarely during long vacations from Oxford.<ref name=Estep/> For this he had to give up the headship of Balliol College, though he could continue to live at Oxford. He is said to have had rooms in the buildings of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]]. In 1362 he was granted a [[prebendary|prebend]] at [[Aust]] in [[Westbury on Trym, Bristol|Westbury-on-Trym]], which he held in addition to the post at Fillingham.\n\nHis performance led [[Simon Islip]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to place him in 1365 at the head of [[Canterbury Hall]], where twelve young men were preparing for the priesthood. In December 1365 Islip appointed Wycliffe as warden<ref name=Budd/> but when Islip died the following year his successor, [[Simon Langham]], a man of monastic training, turned the leadership of the college over to a monk. In 1367 Wycliffe appealed to Rome. In 1371 Wycliffe's appeal was decided and the outcome was unfavourable to him. The incident was typical of the ongoing rivalry between monks and secular clergy at Oxford at this time.<ref name=Estep>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUENoh0ey4QC&pg=PA59&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEQQ6AEwCDgoahUKEwjs5PG69oDHAhVD0YAKHaqZDdo#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=Renaissance and Reformation|first=William Roscoe|last=Estep|date=26 October 1986|publisher=Wm.

In a book concerned with the government of God and the [[Ten Commandments]], he attacked the temporal rule of the clergy, the collection of [[annates]], [[indulgence]]s, and [[simony]].\n\nHe entered the politics of the day with his great work ''De civili dominio'' (\"On Civil Dominion\"). This called for the royal divestment of all church property.<ref name=Lahey>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_jKb_rjQQIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEsQ6AEwCTgUahUKEwjkxNrnoP_GAhULkQ0KHTP8Cbs#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=John Wyclif|first=Stephen Edmund|last=Lahey|date=8 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> His ideas on lordship and church wealth caused his first official condemnation in 1377 by Pope Gregory XI, who censured 19 articles. Wycliffe argued that the Church had fallen into sin and that it ought therefore to give up all its property and that the clergy should live in complete poverty. The tendency of the high offices of state to be held by clerics was resented by many of the nobles. [[John of Gaunt]] most likely had his own reasons for opposing the wealth and power of the clergy.\n\n===Conflict with the Church===\nWycliffe was summoned before [[William Courtenay]], [[Bishop of London]], on 19 February 1377. The exact charges are not known, as the matter did not get as far as a definite examination. Lechler suggests that Wycliffe was targeted by John of Gaunt's opponents among the nobles and church hierarchy.<ref name=Lechler>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHIJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCWoVChMIif-Wi5P-xgIVhc2ACh1LlAVl#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=John Wycliffe and His English Precursors|first=Gotthard Victor|last=Lechler|date=26 October 1904|publisher=Religious Tract Society|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> Gaunt, the [[Earl Marshal]] [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], and a number of other supporters accompanied Wycliffe. A crowd gathered at the church, and at the entrance, party animosities began to show, especially in an angry exchange between the bishop and Wycliffe's protectors.<ref name=Urquhart/> Gaunt declared that he would humble the pride of the English clergy and their partisans, hinting at the intent to secularise the possessions of the Church. The assembly broke up and Gaunt and his partisans departed with their [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]].<ref>An excellent account of this dispute between the bishop and the protectors of Wycliffe is given in the ''Chronicon Angliae'', the gist of which is quoted in ''DNB'', lxiii. 206\u20137.</ref>\n\nMost of the English clergy were irritated by this encounter, and attacks upon Wycliffe began. The second and third books of his work dealing with civil government carry a sharp [[polemic]]. On 22 May 1377 [[Pope Gregory XI]] sent five copies of a [[Papal bull|bull]] against Wycliffe, dispatching one to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and the others to the [[Bishop of London]], [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], and the university; among the enclosures were 18 theses of his, which were denounced as erroneous and dangerous to Church and State. Stephen Lahey suggests that Gregory's action against Wycliffe was an attempt to put pressure on King Edward to make peace with France.<ref name=Lahey/> Edward III died on 21 June 1377, and the bull against Wycliffe did not reach England before December. Wycliffe was asked to give the king's council his opinion on whether it was lawful to withhold traditional payments to Rome, and he responded that it was.<ref name=Kiefer>{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/27.html|title=John Wyclif, Translator and Controversialist|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBack at Oxford the [[Vice-Chancellor]] confined Wycliffe for some time in Black Hall, but his friends soon obtained his release. In March 1378, he was summoned to appear at [[Lambeth Palace]] to defend himself. However, Sir Lewis Clifford entered the chapel and in the name of the queen mother ([[Joan of Kent]]), forbade the bishops to proceed to a definite sentence concerning Wycliffe's conduct or opinions.<ref name=Vaughn/> The bishops, who were divided, satisfied themselves with forbidding him to speak further on the controversy. Wycliffe then wrote his ''De incarcerandis fedelibus'', in which he demanded that it should be legal for the excommunicated to appeal to the king and his council against the excommunication; in this writing he laid open the entire case, in such a way that it was understood by the laity. He wrote his 33 conclusions in Latin and English. The masses, some of the nobility, and his former protector, John of Gaunt, rallied to him. Before any further steps could be taken at Rome, Gregory XI died in 1378.\n\nThe attacks on Pope Gregory XI grow ever more extreme. Wycliffe's stand concerning the ideal of poverty became continually firmer, as well as his position with regard to the temporal rule of the clergy. Closely related to this attitude was his book ''De officio regis'', the content of which was foreshadowed in his 33 conclusions. This book, like those that preceded and followed, was concerned with the reform of the Church, in which the temporal arm was to have an influential part.\n\nFrom 1380 onwards, Wycliffe devoted himself to writings that argued his rejection of [[transubstantiation]], and strongly criticised the [[friars]] who supported it.<ref name=hudson>{{Cite book| publisher = Clarendon| isbn = 978-0-19-822762-5| last = Hudson| first = Anne| authorlink = Anne Hudson (academic)| title = The premature Reformation: Wycliffite texts and Lollard history| location = Oxford| date = 2002| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/prematurereforma0000huds}}</ref>{{Rp|281}}\n\n== Doctrines ==\n[[Image:John Wycliffe at work.jpg|thumb|left|John Wycliffe at work in his study]]\n\nWycliffe had come to regard the scriptures as the only reliable guide to the truth about God, and maintained that all Christians should rely on the Bible rather than on the teachings of popes and clerics. He said that there was no scriptural justification for the papacy.<ref name=Cavendish/>\n\nTheologically, his preaching expressed a strong belief in predestination that enabled him to declare an \"[[Invisible church|invisible church of the elect]]\", made up of those predestined to be saved, rather than in the \"visible\" [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"Britannica Encyclopedia, 2009\">{{Citation|contribution-url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650168/John-Wycliffe|contribution = John Wycliffe|title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|edition = online|date = 16 October 2009}}.</ref>\nTo Wycliffe, the Church was the totality of those who are [[predestination|predestined]] to blessedness. No one who is eternally lost has part in it. There is one [[Catholicism|universal Church]], and outside of it there is no [[salvation]].\n\nHis first tracts and greater works of ecclesiastical-political content defended the privileges of the State. By 1379 in his ''De ecclesia'' (\"On the Church\"), Wycliffe clearly claimed the supremacy of the king over the priesthood.<ref name=Conti/> He rejected the concept of [[purgatory]],<ref name=Budd/> and disapproved of [[clerical celibacy]], pilgrimages, the selling of [[indulgences]] and praying to saints.<ref name=Cavendish>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/john-wycliffe-condemned-heretic|title=John Wycliffe condemned as a heretic &#124; History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nSo far as his polemics accord with those of earlier antagonists of the papacy, it is fair to assume that he was not ignorant of them and was influenced by them. It was Wycliffe who recognised and formulated one of the two major formal principles of the Reformation \u2013 the unique [[authority]] of the Bible for the belief and life of the Christian.\n\n===Attack on monasticism===\nThe battle against what he saw as an imperialised papacy and its supporters, the \"sects\", as he called the monastic orders, takes up a large space not only in his later works as the ''Trialogus'', ''Dialogus'', ''Opus evangelicum'', and in his sermons, but also in a series of sharp tracts and polemical productions in Latin and English (of which those issued in his later years have been collected as \"Polemical Writings\").\n\nIn the 1380 ''Objections to Friars'', he calls monks the pests of society, enemies of religion, and patrons and promoters of every crime.<ref name=Murray/> He directed his strongest criticism against the friars, whose preaching he considered neither scriptural nor sincere, but motivated by \"temporal gain\".<ref name=Estep/> While others were content to seek the reform of particular errors and abuses, Wycliffe sought nothing less than the extinction of the institution itself, as being repugnant to scripture, and inconsistent with the order and prosperity of the Church.<ref name=Vaughn/> He advocated the dissolution of the monasteries.\n\n===Views on the papacy===\nRudolph Buddensieg finds two distinct aspects in Wycliffe's work. The first, from 1366 to 1378, reflects a political struggle with Rome, while 1378 to 1384 is more a religious struggle. In each Wycliffe has two approaches: he attacks both the Papacy and its institutions, and also Roman Catholic doctrine.<ref name=Rudolph>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ik0jPJfawIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwi55KTM-_7GAhWGv4AKHc6oBIc#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=John Wiclif's Polemical works in Latin|first=John|last=Wycliffe|date=26 October 1883|publisher=Wyclif society|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWycliffe's influence was never greater than at the moment when pope and [[Antipope Clement VII|antipope]] sent their ambassadors to England to gain recognition for themselves. In 1378, in the ambassadors' presence, he delivered an opinion before Parliament that showed, in an important ecclesiastical political question (the matter of the [[right of asylum]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]), a position that was to the liking of the State. He argued that criminals who had taken sanctuary in churches might lawfully be dragged out of sanctuary.<ref name=Kiefer/>\n\nThe books and tracts of Wycliffe's last six years include continual attacks upon the papacy and the entire hierarchy of his times. Each year they focus more and more, and at the last, the pope and the [[Antichrist]] seem to him practically equivalent concepts. Yet there are passages which are moderate in tone: [[Gotthard Victor Lechler|G. V. Lechler]] identifies three stages in Wycliffe's relations with the papacy. The first step, which carried him to the outbreak of the [[Schism (religion)|schism]], involves moderate recognition of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]]; the second, which carried him to 1381, is marked by an estrangement from the papacy; and the third shows him in sharp contest.\n\n==The English Bible ==\n[[Image:John wycliffe scriptro majoris britanniae 1548.jpg|thumb|John Wycliffe portrayed in [[John Bale|Bale]]'s ''Scriptor Majoris Britanni\u00e6'' 1548.]]\nIn keeping with Wycliffe's belief that scripture was the only authoritative reliable guide to the truth about God, he became involved in efforts to translate the Bible into English. While Wycliffe is credited, it is not possible exactly to define his part in the translation, which was based on the [[Vulgate]].<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Williston|title=A History of the Christian Church |location=New York, NY |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |date=1958 |page=269|asin=B00087NRC8}}</ref> There is no doubt that it was his initiative, and that the success of the project was due to his leadership. From him comes the translation of the [[New Testament]], which was smoother, clearer, and more readable than the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] by his friend [[Nicholas of Hereford]]. The whole was revised by Wycliffe's younger contemporary [[John Purvey]] in 1388.\n\nThere still exist about 150 manuscripts, complete or partial, containing the translation in its revised form. From this, one may easily infer how widely diffused it was in the 15th century. For this reason the Wycliffites in England were often designated by their opponents as \"Bible men\".\n\n== Anti-Wycliffe synod ==\nIn the summer of 1381 Wycliffe formulated his doctrine of the Lord's Supper in twelve short sentences, and made it a duty to advocate it everywhere. Then the English hierarchy proceeded against him. The chancellor of the University of Oxford had some of the declarations pronounced heretical. When this was announced to Wycliffe, he declared that no one could change his convictions. He then appealed \u2013 not to the pope nor to the ecclesiastical authorities of the land, but to the king. He published his great confession upon the subject and also a second writing in English intended for the common people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-english-bible-history/john-wycliffe.html|title=John Wycliffe|website=www.greatsite.com|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs long as Wycliffe limited his attacks to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on the support of part of the clergy and aristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], his theses could not be defended any more.<ref name=Conti/> This view cost him the support of John of Gaunt and many others.<ref name=Kiefer/>\n\nIn the midst of this came the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt of 1381]]. The revolt was sparked in part by Wycliffe's preaching carried throughout the realm by \"poor priests\" appointed by Wycliffe (mostly laymen). The preachers didn't limit their criticism of the accumulation of wealth and property to that of the monasteries, but rather included secular properties belonging to the nobility as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ0QoLj5PgM|title=John Wycliffe - Michael Davies|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Although Wycliffe disapproved of the revolt, some of his disciples justified the killing of [[Simon Sudbury]], Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1382 Wycliffe's old enemy [[William Courtenay]], now Archbishop of Canterbury, called an ecclesiastical assembly of notables at London. During the consultations on 21 May [[1382 Dover Straits earthquake|an earthquake]] occurred; the participants were terrified and wished to break up the assembly, but Courtenay declared the earthquake a favourable sign which meant the purification of the earth from erroneous doctrine, and the result of the \"[[Earthquake Synod]]\" was assured.<ref>*\"Earthquake Synod.\" Cross, F. L. and E. A. Livingstone, eds. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.'' London: Oxford UP, 1974. p. 437.</ref>\n\nOf the 24 propositions attributed to Wycliffe without mentioning his name, ten were declared heretical and fourteen erroneous. The former had reference to the transformation in the sacrament, the latter to matters of church order and institutions. It was forbidden from that time to hold these opinions or to advance them in sermons or in academic discussions. All persons disregarding this order were to be subject to prosecution. To accomplish this the help of the State was necessary; but the Commons rejected the bill. The king, however, had a decree issued which permitted the arrest of those in error. \n\nThe citadel of the reformatory movement was Oxford, where Wycliffe's most active helpers were; these were laid under the ban and summoned to recant, and Nicholas of Hereford went to Rome to appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/212/0212.html|title=\u00a712.

He still commanded the favour of the court and of Parliament, to which he addressed a memorial. He was neither excommunicated then, nor deprived of his living.\n\nWycliffe aimed to do away with the existing hierarchy and replace it with the \"poor priests\" who lived in poverty, were bound by no vows, had received no formal [[consecration]], and preached the [[Gospel]] to the people. Itinerant preachers spread the teachings of Wycliffe. The bull of Gregory XI impressed upon them the name of [[Lollards]], intended as an opprobrious epithet, but it became, to them, a name of honour. Even in Wycliffe's time the \"Lollards\" had reached wide circles in England and preached \"God's law, without which no one could be justified.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | title = John Wycliffe (1324-1384)\n | url = http://www.webtruth.org/christian-history/john-wycliffe-1324-1384-morning-star-reformation/\n | website = WebTruth.org\n | date = 18 January 2018\n | access-date = 13 November 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Last days ==\n[[File:Portrait of John Wycliffe.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of John Wycliffe by [[Bernard Picart]], showing the burning of his works.  (1714)]]\n\nIn the years before his death in 1384 he increasingly argued for Scriptures as the authoritative centre of Christianity, that the claims of the papacy were unhistorical, that monasticism was irredeemably corrupt, and that the moral unworthiness of priests [[Donatism|invalidated their office and sacraments]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Herring | first = George | title = Introduction To The History of Christianity | place = New York | publisher = New York University Press | year = 2006 | page = 230}}.</ref>\n\nWycliffe returned to [[Lutterworth]], and sent out tracts against the monks and Urban VI, since the latter, contrary to Wycliffe's hopes, had not turned out to be a reforming pope. The literary achievements of Wycliffe's last days, such as the ''Trialogus'', stand at the peak of the knowledge of his day. His last work, the ''Opus evangelicum'', the last part of which he named in characteristic fashion \"Of Antichrist\", remained uncompleted. While he was saying Mass in the parish church on [[Holy Innocents' Day]], 28 December 1384, he suffered a stroke, and died as the year ended.\n\nThe Anti-Wycliffite Statute of 1401 extended persecution to Wycliffe's remaining followers. The \"Constitutions of Oxford\" of 1408 aimed to reclaim authority in all ecclesiastical matters, and specifically named John Wycliffe as it banned certain writings, and noted that translation of Scripture into English by unlicensed laity was a crime punishable by charges of heresy.\n\n== Declared a heretic==\n[[Image:Wycliffe bones Foxe.jpg|thumb|Burning Wycliffe's bones, from ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' (1563)]]\n\nThe [[Council of Constance]] declared Wycliffe a heretic on 4 May 1415, and banned his writings, effectively both excommunicating him retroactively and making him an early forerunner of Protestantism. The Council decreed that Wycliffe's works should be [[Book burning|burned]] and his bodily remains removed from consecrated ground. This order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428.<ref name=Conti/> Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]], which flows through Lutterworth.\n\nNone of Wycliffe's contemporaries left a complete picture of his person, his life, and his activities. Paintings representing Wycliffe are from a later period. In the history of the trial by [[The Testimony of William Thorpe|William Thorpe]] (1407), Wycliffe appears wasted and physically weak. Thorpe says Wycliffe was of unblemished walk{{clarify|date=December 2015}} in life, and regarded affectionately by people of rank, who often consorted with him, took down his sayings, and clung to him. \"I indeed clove to none closer than to him, the wisest and most blessed of all men whom I have ever found.\"\n\n[[Thomas Netter]] highly esteemed John Kynyngham in that he \"so bravely offered himself to the biting speech of the [[heresy|heretic]] and to words that stung as being without the religion of Christ\". But this example of Netter is not well chosen, since the tone of Wycliffe toward Kynyngham is that of a junior toward an elder whom one respects, and he handled other opponents in similar fashion.\n\n==Works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''The Last Age of the Church'' (1356)\n* ''De Logica'' (\"On Logic\") 1360\n* ''De Universalibus'' (\"On Universals\") 1368\n* ''De Dominio Divino'' (1373)\n* ''De Mandatis Divinis'' (1375)\n* ''De Statu Innocencie'' (1376)\n* ''De Civili Dominio'' (1377)\n* ''Responsio'' (1377) \n* ''De Ecclesia'' (\"On the Church\") 1378\n* ''De veritate sacrae scripturae'' (On the Truthfulness of Holy Scripture) 1378\n* ''On the Pastoral Office'' 1378\n* ''De apostasia'' (\"On Apostasy\") 1379\n* ''De Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist\") 1379\n* ''Objections to Friars'' (1380)\n}}\n\n== Basic positions in philosophy ==\n\nWycliffe was the most prominent English philosopher of the second half of the 14th century.<ref name=Conti/> He earned his great repute as a philosopher at an early date. [[Henry Knighton]] says that in philosophy he was second to none, and in scholastic discipline incomparable.{{cn|date=April 2019}} There was a period in his life when he devoted himself exclusively to scholastic philosophy. His first book, ''De Logica'' (1360), explores the fundamentals of Scholastic Theology. He believed that \"one should study Logic in order to better understand the human mind because ...human thoughts, feelings and actions bear God\u2019s image and likeness\".<ref name=Mattei/>\n\nThe centre of Wycliffe's philosophical system is formed by the doctrine of the prior existence in the thought of God of all things and events. While [[Plato|Platonic realism]] would view \"beauty' as a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing, \"for Wycliffe every [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]], as part of creation, derived its existence from God, the Creator\".<ref name=Mattei>{{Cite web|url=https://leben.us/john-wycliffe-morning-star-reformation/|title=John Wycliffe: The Morning Star of the Reformation|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> Wycliffe was a close follower of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and always upheld the primacy of the Creator over the created reality.\n \nA second key point of Wycliffe's is his emphasis on the notion of divine Lordship, explored in ''De dominio Divino'' (c.1373), which examines the relationship between God and his creatures. The practical application of this for Wycliffe was seen in the rebellious attitude of individuals (particulars) towards rightful authority (universals). In ''De civili dominio'' he discusses the appropriate circumstance under which an entity may be seen as possessing authority over lesser subjects. ''Dominium'' is always conferred by God. \"Beyond all doubt, intellectual and emotional error about universals is the cause of all sin that reigns in the world.\"<ref>Wycliffe, John. ''On Universals'', (trans. A. Kenny), Oxford: 1985, 162\u2013165</ref> In some of his teachings, as in ''De annihilatione'', the influence of [[Thomas Aquinas]] can be detected.\n\nHe said that [[Democritus]], Plato, Augustine, and [[Grosseteste]] far outranked Aristotle. So far as his relations to the [[Medieval philosophy|philosophers of the Middle Ages]] are concerned, he held to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] as opposed to the [[nominalism]] advanced by [[William of Ockham]]. \n\nA number of Wycliffe's ideas have been carried forward in the twentieth century by philosopher and Reformed theologian [[Cornelius Van Til]].\n\n== Attitude toward speculation ==\nWycliffe's fundamental principle of the preexistence in thought of all reality involves the most serious obstacle to freedom of the will; the philosopher could assist himself only by the formula that the [[free will]] of man was something predetermined of God. He demanded strict dialectical training as the means of distinguishing the true from the false, and asserted that logic (or the [[syllogism]]) furthered the knowledge of catholic verities; ignorance of logic was the reason why men misunderstood Scripture, since men overlooked the connection, the distinction between idea and appearance.\n\nWycliffe was not merely conscious of the distinction between theology and philosophy, but his sense of reality led him to pass by scholastic questions. He left aside philosophical discussions that seemed to have no significance for the religious consciousness and those that pertained purely to [[scholasticism]]: \"We concern ourselves with the verities that are, and leave aside the errors which arise from speculation on matters which are not.\"\n\n== Veneration ==\nWycliffe is honoured in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Church of England]] on 31 December, and in the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] <ref>{{Citation|contribution = 57. The Calendar, ix |contribution-url = http://prayerbook.ca/the-prayer-book-online/57-the-calendar-ix|title = The Prayer Book online|place = [[Canada|CA]]}}</ref> and in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on 30 October.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Wycliffecollege toronto chapel1.jpg|thumb|A stained glass window in [[Wycliffe College]] Chapel, Toronto]]\nWycliffe was instrumental in the development of a translation of the Bible in English, thus making it accessible to laypeople.

He became an influential dissident within the Roman Catholic priesthood during the 14th century and is considered an important predecessor to [[Protestantism]].\n\nWycliffe attacked the privileged status of the clergy, which had bolstered their powerful role in England. He then attacked the luxury and pomp of local parishes and their ceremonies.<ref>Lacey Baldwin Smith, ''This Realm of England: 1399 to 1688'' (3rd ed. 1976), p. 41</ref>\n\nWycliffe also advocated translation of the Bible into the [[vernacular]]. In 1382 he completed a translation directly from the [[Vulgate]] into [[Middle English]] \u2013 a version now known as [[Wycliffe's Bible]]. It is probable that he personally translated the Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John| John]]; and it is possible he translated the entire [[New Testament]], while his associates translated the [[Old Testament]]. Wycliffe's Bible appears to have been completed by 1384, additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe's assistant [[John Purvey]] and others in 1388 and 1395.\n\nWycliffe's followers, known as [[Lollards]], followed his lead in advocating [[predestination]], [[iconoclasm]], and the notion of [[caesaropapism]], while attacking the [[veneration of saints]], the [[sacraments]], [[requiem mass]]es, [[transubstantiation]], [[monasticism]], and the very existence of the [[Pope|Papacy]].\n\nIn the 16th century and beyond, the Lollard movement was sometimes regarded as the precursor to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Wycliffe was accordingly characterised as the evening star of [[scholasticism]] and as the [[Eosphoros|morning star]] of the [[English Reformation]].<ref>Emily Michael, \"John Wyclif on body and mind\", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (2003) p 343.</ref> Wycliffe's writings in Latin greatly influenced the philosophy and teaching of the Czech reformer [[Jan Hus]] ({{circa}} 1369\u20131415), whose execution in 1415 sparked a revolt and led to the [[Hussite Wars]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07584b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Jan Hus|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\nof 1419\u20131434.\n\n== Early life ==\nWycliffe was born in the village of [[Hipswell]] near [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], England, around the 1320s{{Efn |He has conventionally been given a birth date of 1324 but Hudson and Kenny state only records \"suggest he was born in the mid-1320s\"<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Oxford | title = Dictionary of National Biography}}.</ref> Conti simply states that he was born \"before 1330\".<ref name=\"Conti\">{{cite web |last1=Conti |first1=Alessandro |title=John Wyclif |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wyclif/ |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=3 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>}} His family was long settled in Yorkshire.

''Oxford \u2013 Images & Recollections, p. 261. {{ISBN|1-86982499-7}}.</ref> That same year he produced a small treatise, ''The Last Age of the Church''. In the light of the virulence of the plague that had subsided only seven years previously, Wycliffe's studies led him to the opinion that the close of the 14th century would mark the end of the world. While other writers viewed the plague as God's judgment on sinful people, Wycliffe saw it as an indictment of an unworthy clergy. The mortality rate among the clergy had been particularly high, and those who replaced them were, in his opinion, uneducated or generally disreputable.<ref name=Murray/>\n\nHe was [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] in 1361.<ref>{{cite web |title= Archives & Manuscripts |url= http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/History/masters.asp |publisher= Balliol College | place = Oxford | accessdate= 22 August 2009}}</ref> In this same year, he was presented by the college to the parish of [[Fillingham]] in [[Lincolnshire]], which he visited rarely during long vacations from Oxford.<ref name=Estep/> For this he had to give up the headship of Balliol College, though he could continue to live at Oxford. He is said to have had rooms in the buildings of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]]. In 1362 he was granted a [[prebendary|prebend]] at [[Aust]] in [[Westbury on Trym, Bristol|Westbury-on-Trym]], which he held in addition to the post at Fillingham.\n\nHis performance led [[Simon Islip]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to place him in 1365 at the head of [[Canterbury Hall]], where twelve young men were preparing for the priesthood. In December 1365 Islip appointed Wycliffe as warden<ref name=Budd/> but when Islip died the following year his successor, [[Simon Langham]], a man of monastic training, turned the leadership of the college over to a monk. In 1367 Wycliffe appealed to Rome. In 1371 Wycliffe's appeal was decided and the outcome was unfavourable to him. The incident was typical of the ongoing rivalry between monks and secular clergy at Oxford at this time.<ref name=Estep>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUENoh0ey4QC&pg=PA59&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEQQ6AEwCDgoahUKEwjs5PG69oDHAhVD0YAKHaqZDdo#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=Renaissance and Reformation|first=William Roscoe|last=Estep|date=26 October 1986|publisher=Wm.

Wycliffe argued that the Church had fallen into sin and that it ought therefore to give up all its property and that the clergy should live in complete poverty. The tendency of the high offices of state to be held by clerics was resented by many of the nobles. [[John of Gaunt]] most likely had his own reasons for opposing the wealth and power of the clergy.\n\n===Conflict with the Church===\nWycliffe was summoned before [[William Courtenay]], [[Bishop of London]], on 19 February 1377. The exact charges are not known, as the matter did not get as far as a definite examination. Lechler suggests that Wycliffe was targeted by John of Gaunt's opponents among the nobles and church hierarchy.<ref name=Lechler>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHIJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCWoVChMIif-Wi5P-xgIVhc2ACh1LlAVl#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=John Wycliffe and His English Precursors|first=Gotthard Victor|last=Lechler|date=26 October 1904|publisher=Religious Tract Society|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> Gaunt, the [[Earl Marshal]] [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], and a number of other supporters accompanied Wycliffe. A crowd gathered at the church, and at the entrance, party animosities began to show, especially in an angry exchange between the bishop and Wycliffe's protectors.<ref name=Urquhart/> Gaunt declared that he would humble the pride of the English clergy and their partisans, hinting at the intent to secularise the possessions of the Church. The assembly broke up and Gaunt and his partisans departed with their [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]].<ref>An excellent account of this dispute between the bishop and the protectors of Wycliffe is given in the ''Chronicon Angliae'', the gist of which is quoted in ''DNB'', lxiii. 206\u20137.</ref>\n\nMost of the English clergy were irritated by this encounter, and attacks upon Wycliffe began. The second and third books of his work dealing with civil government carry a sharp [[polemic]]. On 22 May 1377 [[Pope Gregory XI]] sent five copies of a [[Papal bull|bull]] against Wycliffe, dispatching one to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and the others to the [[Bishop of London]], [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], and the university; among the enclosures were 18 theses of his, which were denounced as erroneous and dangerous to Church and State. Stephen Lahey suggests that Gregory's action against Wycliffe was an attempt to put pressure on King Edward to make peace with France.<ref name=Lahey/> Edward III died on 21 June 1377, and the bull against Wycliffe did not reach England before December. Wycliffe was asked to give the king's council his opinion on whether it was lawful to withhold traditional payments to Rome, and he responded that it was.<ref name=Kiefer>{{cite web|url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/27.html|title=John Wyclif, Translator and Controversialist|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBack at Oxford the [[Vice-Chancellor]] confined Wycliffe for some time in Black Hall, but his friends soon obtained his release. In March 1378, he was summoned to appear at [[Lambeth Palace]] to defend himself. However, Sir Lewis Clifford entered the chapel and in the name of the queen mother ([[Joan of Kent]]), forbade the bishops to proceed to a definite sentence concerning Wycliffe's conduct or opinions.<ref name=Vaughn/> The bishops, who were divided, satisfied themselves with forbidding him to speak further on the controversy. Wycliffe then wrote his ''De incarcerandis fedelibus'', in which he demanded that it should be legal for the excommunicated to appeal to the king and his council against the excommunication; in this writing he laid open the entire case, in such a way that it was understood by the laity. He wrote his 33 conclusions in Latin and English. The masses, some of the nobility, and his former protector, John of Gaunt, rallied to him. Before any further steps could be taken at Rome, Gregory XI died in 1378.\n\nThe attacks on Pope Gregory XI grow ever more extreme. Wycliffe's stand concerning the ideal of poverty became continually firmer, as well as his position with regard to the temporal rule of the clergy. Closely related to this attitude was his book ''De officio regis'', the content of which was foreshadowed in his 33 conclusions. This book, like those that preceded and followed, was concerned with the reform of the Church, in which the temporal arm was to have an influential part.\n\nFrom 1380 onwards, Wycliffe devoted himself to writings that argued his rejection of [[transubstantiation]], and strongly criticised the [[friars]] who supported it.<ref name=hudson>{{Cite book| publisher = Clarendon| isbn = 978-0-19-822762-5| last = Hudson| first = Anne| authorlink = Anne Hudson (academic)| title = The premature Reformation: Wycliffite texts and Lollard history| location = Oxford| date = 2002| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/prematurereforma0000huds}}</ref>{{Rp|281}}\n\n== Doctrines ==\n[[Image:John Wycliffe at work.jpg|thumb|left|John Wycliffe at work in his study]]\n\nWycliffe had come to regard the scriptures as the only reliable guide to the truth about God, and maintained that all Christians should rely on the Bible rather than on the teachings of popes and clerics. He said that there was no scriptural justification for the papacy.<ref name=Cavendish/>\n\nTheologically, his preaching expressed a strong belief in predestination that enabled him to declare an \"[[Invisible church|invisible church of the elect]]\", made up of those predestined to be saved, rather than in the \"visible\" [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=\"Britannica Encyclopedia, 2009\">{{Citation|contribution-url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650168/John-Wycliffe|contribution = John Wycliffe|title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|edition = online|date = 16 October 2009}}.</ref>\nTo Wycliffe, the Church was the totality of those who are [[predestination|predestined]] to blessedness. No one who is eternally lost has part in it. There is one [[Catholicism|universal Church]], and outside of it there is no [[salvation]].\n\nHis first tracts and greater works of ecclesiastical-political content defended the privileges of the State. By 1379 in his ''De ecclesia'' (\"On the Church\"), Wycliffe clearly claimed the supremacy of the king over the priesthood.<ref name=Conti/> He rejected the concept of [[purgatory]],<ref name=Budd/> and disapproved of [[clerical celibacy]], pilgrimages, the selling of [[indulgences]] and praying to saints.<ref name=Cavendish>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/john-wycliffe-condemned-heretic|title=John Wycliffe condemned as a heretic &#124; History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nSo far as his polemics accord with those of earlier antagonists of the papacy, it is fair to assume that he was not ignorant of them and was influenced by them. It was Wycliffe who recognised and formulated one of the two major formal principles of the Reformation \u2013 the unique [[authority]] of the Bible for the belief and life of the Christian.\n\n===Attack on monasticism===\nThe battle against what he saw as an imperialised papacy and its supporters, the \"sects\", as he called the monastic orders, takes up a large space not only in his later works as the ''Trialogus'', ''Dialogus'', ''Opus evangelicum'', and in his sermons, but also in a series of sharp tracts and polemical productions in Latin and English (of which those issued in his later years have been collected as \"Polemical Writings\").\n\nIn the 1380 ''Objections to Friars'', he calls monks the pests of society, enemies of religion, and patrons and promoters of every crime.<ref name=Murray/> He directed his strongest criticism against the friars, whose preaching he considered neither scriptural nor sincere, but motivated by \"temporal gain\".<ref name=Estep/> While others were content to seek the reform of particular errors and abuses, Wycliffe sought nothing less than the extinction of the institution itself, as being repugnant to scripture, and inconsistent with the order and prosperity of the Church.<ref name=Vaughn/> He advocated the dissolution of the monasteries.\n\n===Views on the papacy===\nRudolph Buddensieg finds two distinct aspects in Wycliffe's work. The first, from 1366 to 1378, reflects a political struggle with Rome, while 1378 to 1384 is more a religious struggle. In each Wycliffe has two approaches: he attacks both the Papacy and its institutions, and also Roman Catholic doctrine.<ref name=Rudolph>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ik0jPJfawIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+wycliffe&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgKahUKEwi55KTM-_7GAhWGv4AKHc6oBIc#v=onepage&q=john+wycliffe&f=false|title=John Wiclif's Polemical works in Latin|first=John|last=Wycliffe|date=26 October 1883|publisher=Wyclif society|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWycliffe's influence was never greater than at the moment when pope and [[Antipope Clement VII|antipope]] sent their ambassadors to England to gain recognition for themselves. In 1378, in the ambassadors' presence, he delivered an opinion before Parliament that showed, in an important ecclesiastical political question (the matter of the [[right of asylum]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]), a position that was to the liking of the State. He argued that criminals who had taken sanctuary in churches might lawfully be dragged out of sanctuary.<ref name=Kiefer/>\n\nThe books and tracts of Wycliffe's last six years include continual attacks upon the papacy and the entire hierarchy of his times. Each year they focus more and more, and at the last, the pope and the [[Antichrist]] seem to him practically equivalent concepts. Yet there are passages which are moderate in tone: [[Gotthard Victor Lechler|G. V. Lechler]] identifies three stages in Wycliffe's relations with the papacy. The first step, which carried him to the outbreak of the [[Schism (religion)|schism]], involves moderate recognition of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]]; the second, which carried him to 1381, is marked by an estrangement from the papacy; and the third shows him in sharp contest.\n\n==The English Bible ==\n[[Image:John wycliffe scriptro majoris britanniae 1548.jpg|thumb|John Wycliffe portrayed in [[John Bale|Bale]]'s ''Scriptor Majoris Britanni\u00e6'' 1548.]]\nIn keeping with Wycliffe's belief that scripture was the only authoritative reliable guide to the truth about God, he became involved in efforts to translate the Bible into English. While Wycliffe is credited, it is not possible exactly to define his part in the translation, which was based on the [[Vulgate]].<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Williston|title=A History of the Christian Church |location=New York, NY |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |date=1958 |page=269|asin=B00087NRC8}}</ref> There is no doubt that it was his initiative, and that the success of the project was due to his leadership. From him comes the translation of the [[New Testament]], which was smoother, clearer, and more readable than the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] by his friend [[Nicholas of Hereford]]. The whole was revised by Wycliffe's younger contemporary [[John Purvey]] in 1388.\n\nThere still exist about 150 manuscripts, complete or partial, containing the translation in its revised form. From this, one may easily infer how widely diffused it was in the 15th century. For this reason the Wycliffites in England were often designated by their opponents as \"Bible men\".\n\n== Anti-Wycliffe synod ==\nIn the summer of 1381 Wycliffe formulated his doctrine of the Lord's Supper in twelve short sentences, and made it a duty to advocate it everywhere. Then the English hierarchy proceeded against him. The chancellor of the University of Oxford had some of the declarations pronounced heretical. When this was announced to Wycliffe, he declared that no one could change his convictions. He then appealed \u2013 not to the pope nor to the ecclesiastical authorities of the land, but to the king. He published his great confession upon the subject and also a second writing in English intended for the common people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-english-bible-history/john-wycliffe.html|title=John Wycliffe|website=www.greatsite.com|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs long as Wycliffe limited his attacks to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on the support of part of the clergy and aristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], his theses could not be defended any more.<ref name=Conti/> This view cost him the support of John of Gaunt and many others.<ref name=Kiefer/>\n\nIn the midst of this came the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt of 1381]]. The revolt was sparked in part by Wycliffe's preaching carried throughout the realm by \"poor priests\" appointed by Wycliffe (mostly laymen). The preachers didn't limit their criticism of the accumulation of wealth and property to that of the monasteries, but rather included secular properties belonging to the nobility as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ0QoLj5PgM|title=John Wycliffe - Michael Davies|accessdate=26 October 2019|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Although Wycliffe disapproved of the revolt, some of his disciples justified the killing of [[Simon Sudbury]], Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1382 Wycliffe's old enemy [[William Courtenay]], now Archbishop of Canterbury, called an ecclesiastical assembly of notables at London. During the consultations on 21 May [[1382 Dover Straits earthquake|an earthquake]] occurred; the participants were terrified and wished to break up the assembly, but Courtenay declared the earthquake a favourable sign which meant the purification of the earth from erroneous doctrine, and the result of the \"[[Earthquake Synod]]\" was assured.<ref>*\"Earthquake Synod.\" Cross, F. L. and E. A. Livingstone, eds. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.'' London: Oxford UP, 1974. p. 437.</ref>\n\nOf the 24 propositions attributed to Wycliffe without mentioning his name, ten were declared heretical and fourteen erroneous. The former had reference to the transformation in the sacrament, the latter to matters of church order and institutions. It was forbidden from that time to hold these opinions or to advance them in sermons or in academic discussions. All persons disregarding this order were to be subject to prosecution. To accomplish this the help of the State was necessary; but the Commons rejected the bill. The king, however, had a decree issued which permitted the arrest of those in error. \n\nThe citadel of the reformatory movement was Oxford, where Wycliffe's most active helpers were; these were laid under the ban and summoned to recant, and Nicholas of Hereford went to Rome to appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/212/0212.html|title=\u00a712.

He still commanded the favour of the court and of Parliament, to which he addressed a memorial. He was neither excommunicated then, nor deprived of his living.\n\nWycliffe aimed to do away with the existing hierarchy and replace it with the \"poor priests\" who lived in poverty, were bound by no vows, had received no formal [[consecration]], and preached the [[Gospel]] to the people. Itinerant preachers spread the teachings of Wycliffe. The bull of Gregory XI impressed upon them the name of [[Lollards]], intended as an opprobrious epithet, but it became, to them, a name of honour. Even in Wycliffe's time the \"Lollards\" had reached wide circles in England and preached \"God's law, without which no one could be justified.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | title = John Wycliffe (1324-1384)\n | url = http://www.webtruth.org/christian-history/john-wycliffe-1324-1384-morning-star-reformation/\n | website = WebTruth.org\n | date = 18 January 2018\n | access-date = 13 November 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== Last days ==\n[[File:Portrait of John Wycliffe.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of John Wycliffe by [[Bernard Picart]], showing the burning of his works.  (1714)]]\n\nIn the years before his death in 1384 he increasingly argued for Scriptures as the authoritative centre of Christianity, that the claims of the papacy were unhistorical, that monasticism was irredeemably corrupt, and that the moral unworthiness of priests [[Donatism|invalidated their office and sacraments]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Herring | first = George | title = Introduction To The History of Christianity | place = New York | publisher = New York University Press | year = 2006 | page = 230}}.</ref>\n\nWycliffe returned to [[Lutterworth]], and sent out tracts against the monks and Urban VI, since the latter, contrary to Wycliffe's hopes, had not turned out to be a reforming pope. The literary achievements of Wycliffe's last days, such as the ''Trialogus'', stand at the peak of the knowledge of his day. His last work, the ''Opus evangelicum'', the last part of which he named in characteristic fashion \"Of Antichrist\", remained uncompleted. While he was saying Mass in the parish church on [[Holy Innocents' Day]], 28 December 1384, he suffered a stroke, and died as the year ended.\n\nThe Anti-Wycliffite Statute of 1401 extended persecution to Wycliffe's remaining followers. The \"Constitutions of Oxford\" of 1408 aimed to reclaim authority in all ecclesiastical matters, and specifically named John Wycliffe as it banned certain writings, and noted that translation of Scripture into English by unlicensed laity was a crime punishable by charges of heresy.\n\n== Declared a heretic==\n[[Image:Wycliffe bones Foxe.jpg|thumb|Burning Wycliffe's bones, from ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' (1563)]]\n\nThe [[Council of Constance]] declared Wycliffe a heretic on 4 May 1415, and banned his writings, effectively both excommunicating him retroactively and making him an early forerunner of Protestantism. The Council decreed that Wycliffe's works should be [[Book burning|burned]] and his bodily remains removed from consecrated ground. This order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428.<ref name=Conti/> Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]], which flows through Lutterworth.\n\nNone of Wycliffe's contemporaries left a complete picture of his person, his life, and his activities. Paintings representing Wycliffe are from a later period. In the history of the trial by [[The Testimony of William Thorpe|William Thorpe]] (1407), Wycliffe appears wasted and physically weak. Thorpe says Wycliffe was of unblemished walk{{clarify|date=December 2015}} in life, and regarded affectionately by people of rank, who often consorted with him, took down his sayings, and clung to him. \"I indeed clove to none closer than to him, the wisest and most blessed of all men whom I have ever found.\"\n\n[[Thomas Netter]] highly esteemed John Kynyngham in that he \"so bravely offered himself to the biting speech of the [[heresy|heretic]] and to words that stung as being without the religion of Christ\". But this example of Netter is not well chosen, since the tone of Wycliffe toward Kynyngham is that of a junior toward an elder whom one respects, and he handled other opponents in similar fashion.\n\n==Works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''The Last Age of the Church'' (1356)\n* ''De Logica'' (\"On Logic\") 1360\n* ''De Universalibus'' (\"On Universals\") 1368\n* ''De Dominio Divino'' (1373)\n* ''De Mandatis Divinis'' (1375)\n* ''De Statu Innocencie'' (1376)\n* ''De Civili Dominio'' (1377)\n* ''Responsio'' (1377) \n* ''De Ecclesia'' (\"On the Church\") 1378\n* ''De veritate sacrae scripturae'' (On the Truthfulness of Holy Scripture) 1378\n* ''On the Pastoral Office'' 1378\n* ''De apostasia'' (\"On Apostasy\") 1379\n* ''De Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist\") 1379\n* ''Objections to Friars'' (1380)\n}}\n\n== Basic positions in philosophy ==\n\nWycliffe was the most prominent English philosopher of the second half of the 14th century.<ref name=Conti/> He earned his great repute as a philosopher at an early date. [[Henry Knighton]] says that in philosophy he was second to none, and in scholastic discipline incomparable.{{cn|date=April 2019}} There was a period in his life when he devoted himself exclusively to scholastic philosophy. His first book, ''De Logica'' (1360), explores the fundamentals of Scholastic Theology. He believed that \"one should study Logic in order to better understand the human mind because ...human thoughts, feelings and actions bear God\u2019s image and likeness\".<ref name=Mattei/>\n\nThe centre of Wycliffe's philosophical system is formed by the doctrine of the prior existence in the thought of God of all things and events. While [[Plato|Platonic realism]] would view \"beauty' as a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing, \"for Wycliffe every [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]], as part of creation, derived its existence from God, the Creator\".<ref name=Mattei>{{Cite web|url=https://leben.us/john-wycliffe-morning-star-reformation/|title=John Wycliffe: The Morning Star of the Reformation|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref> Wycliffe was a close follower of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and always upheld the primacy of the Creator over the created reality.\n \nA second key point of Wycliffe's is his emphasis on the notion of divine Lordship, explored in ''De dominio Divino'' (c.1373), which examines the relationship between God and his creatures. The practical application of this for Wycliffe was seen in the rebellious attitude of individuals (particulars) towards rightful authority (universals). In ''De civili dominio'' he discusses the appropriate circumstance under which an entity may be seen as possessing authority over lesser subjects. ''Dominium'' is always conferred by God. \"Beyond all doubt, intellectual and emotional error about universals is the cause of all sin that reigns in the world.\"<ref>Wycliffe, John. ''On Universals'', (trans. A. Kenny), Oxford: 1985, 162\u2013165</ref> In some of his teachings, as in ''De annihilatione'', the influence of [[Thomas Aquinas]] can be detected.\n\nHe said that [[Democritus]], Plato, Augustine, and [[Grosseteste]] far outranked Aristotle. So far as his relations to the [[Medieval philosophy|philosophers of the Middle Ages]] are concerned, he held to [[Philosophical realism|realism]] as opposed to the [[nominalism]] advanced by [[William of Ockham]]. \n\nA number of Wycliffe's ideas have been carried forward in the twentieth century by philosopher and Reformed theologian [[Cornelius Van Til]].\n\n== Attitude toward speculation ==\nWycliffe's fundamental principle of the preexistence in thought of all reality involves the most serious obstacle to freedom of the will; the philosopher could assist himself only by the formula that the [[free will]] of man was something predetermined of God. He demanded strict dialectical training as the means of distinguishing the true from the false, and asserted that logic (or the [[syllogism]]) furthered the knowledge of catholic verities; ignorance of logic was the reason why men misunderstood Scripture, since men overlooked the connection, the distinction between idea and appearance.\n\nWycliffe was not merely conscious of the distinction between theology and philosophy, but his sense of reality led him to pass by scholastic questions. He left aside philosophical discussions that seemed to have no significance for the religious consciousness and those that pertained purely to [[scholasticism]]: \"We concern ourselves with the verities that are, and leave aside the errors which arise from speculation on matters which are not.\"\n\n== Veneration ==\nWycliffe is honoured in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|Church of England]] on 31 December, and in the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] <ref>{{Citation|contribution = 57.

{"title_page": "A Staircase in Surrey", "text_new": "'''''A Staircase in Surrey''''' is a sequence of five [[novel]]s by \n[[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] and academic [[J. I. M. Stewart]] (1906&ndash;1994), and published between 1974 and 1978 by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] in London. The word \"Surrey\" in the title of the quintet refers to student accommodation in an imaginary [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] college. (A staircase, in the more traditionally designed colleges, is a group of students' rooms, with a ground-floor entrance leading off a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]].)\n\n==The series==\nThe books, in order of publication, are:\n*''The Gaudy'' (1974)\n*''Young Patullo'' (1975)\n*''A Memorial Service'' (1976)\n*''The Madonna of the Astrolabe'' (1977)\n*''Full Term'' (1978)\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe narrator and central character is [[playwright]] Duncan Patullo, son of Lachlan Patullo, a noted Scottish artist specializing in landscapes but occasionally painting portraits. He is educated in Edinburgh, at a school clearly intended to recall [[Fettes_College|Fettes]], and then at the unnamed College in Oxford (of which Surrey is one of the quadrangles) as the John Ruskin Scholar. \n\nIn the first novel of the sequence, ''The Gaudy'', Patullo returns to his Oxford College, after a long absence (and a successful career as a playwright, including extended residence abroad), and encounters a number of old friends, including Albert Talbert, his former tutor in English Literature; Lord Marchpayne, formerly Tony Mumford (an undergraduate contemporary who lived in the set of rooms opposite his); fellow Scot and schoolmate Ranald McKechnie, now Regius Professor of Greek at the college (McKechnie's wife, Janet, is Duncan's first love); Cyril Bedworth (now the college's Senior Tutor but formerly an undergraduate friend who lived at the top of Patullo's staircase); and Robert Damien (College doctor, but also a contemporary of Patullo's who embarrassed him by replacing the sketch for a famous painting that he owned with a bawdy picture of Mumford's at exactly the point when the great and the good had assembled to view it).\n\nThe second novel, ''Young Patullo'', tells the story of their former relationships and Patullo's undergraduate career. In ''A Memorial Service'' Patullo is instrumental in resolving the crisis caused by the academic insufficiency and aggressively anti-institutional behaviour of Ivo Mumford, his friend Tony's son, and begins a tentative involvement with his cousin Fiona Petrie, a don at one of the women's Colleges, as well as rekindling a friendship with Janet McKechnie. The title refers obliquely to the character of Paul Lusby, who committed suicide in the first novel as a result of a foolish wager proposed by Ivo Mumford, and whose brother Peter is seeking admission to the College, partly in memory of his brother. In ''The Madonna of the Astrolabe'' Patullo has to cope with his ex-wife and her sexual designs on current undergraduates, the undergraduates' production of ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine]]'', and the problems of raising enough money for the urgently needed restoration of the crumbling Great Tower (modelled on [[Tom Tower]]). The discovery of a lost masterpiece by [[Piero della Francesca]] proves crucial to the college's future fortunes, and Patullo is able to help when it is stolen. '' Full Term'' takes up Patullo's emotional conflicts but focuses on the scandalous, and apparently treasonous, behaviour of the College's Physics tutor, William Watershute, which are dramatically resolved at the end. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Staircase In Surrey, A}}\n[[Category:20th-century British novels]]\n[[Category:Novel sequences]]\n[[Category:University of Oxford in fiction]]\n[[Category:1970s novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Oxford]]\n[[Category:Novels about writers]]\n[[Category:Campus novels]]\n[[Category:Scottish novels]]\n", "text_old": "'''''A Staircase in Surrey''''' is a sequence of five [[novel]]s by \n[[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] and academic [[J.

'' Full Term'' takes up Patullo's emotional conflicts but focuses on the scandalous, and apparently treasonous, behaviour of the College's Physics tutor, William Watershute, which are dramatically resolved at the end. \n\n==Background==\n\nThe College, which is not named in the novels, is very clearly based on one of Stewart's own Colleges, [[Christ_Church,_Oxford|Christ Church]], where he was Student (i.e. Fellow and Tutor) from 1949 until 1973, and University Reader in English. Surrey is modelled on Peckwater Quadrangle, which houses the College library as the novels suggest, but does not have a statue of a former Head of House (in the middle of Surrey there is a statue of Provost Harbage). The character of the Provost (Head of the College) is based on that of [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford]] during Stewart's own time there.<ref name=Guardian>[[Rowan Williams|Williams, Rowan]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/19/religion Obituary\u2014Henry Chadwick\u2014He was a leading Anglican scholar and strove for ecumenicalism], ''[[The Guardian]]', 19 June 2008. Retrieved 2008-06-26.</ref> His name is taken from that of Edward Pococke (1604-91), seventeenth century Regius Professor of Hebrew (1648-91), after whom the Pococke Tree (the inspiration for [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Jabberwocky]]) and the Pococke Garden in Christ Church are named.<ref>https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/pococke-garden</ref> Fantasy writer and Oxford don [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] appears (or is remembered) as the elderly \"Professor J. B. Timbermill\" in all the novels. The character of Arnold Lempriere, an ancient and semi-retired history don at the College, is based on the eccentric Christ Church Censor R. H. Dundas. Tony Mumford's title \"Marchpayne\" is obviously both a nod to the Marquess of Marchmain, a character in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s [[Brideshead Revisited]] (another novel partly set in Christ Church, Oxford), but also a joke on \"marchpane\", an old name for marzipan. Stewart makes an oblique reference to himself in ''Full Term'': 'the other [new fellow], bald and abraded, was understood to have escaped in middle age from some professorial assignment in the antipodes' (p. 37) \u2013 Stewart had been Jury Professor of English at the [[University of Adelaide]] before obtaining his post in [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].\n\n==Evaluation==\n\nStewart's sequence of novels is much appreciated for his learned allusiveness and the sheer polish of his narrative style, for his command of irony, and for his remarkable gift for accompanying dialogue with an acute psychological commentary on the contextual motivation for what is said. The quintet is unashamedly nostalgic for an era of Oxford manners that was in the 1970s waning if not already gone, and this has put some readers off (whilst probably attracting others). He reproduces authentic views held by the community he evokes about society, sex, politics, race and education that are by no means widely held nowadays. Few readers will now acquiesce in many of the assumptions made or implied in these areas by the characters or even the narrator. Stewart narrates a world in which privilege and snobbery are normal; he critiques this, but he does not transcend it. In the story about Ivo Mumford's parachuting out of a rape charge a modern reader will surely regret any meaningful reflection on the situation of the victim. The sense that \"boys will be boys\" abounds in these novels, and there is a simplistic acceptance (on a narrative level) of the normality of class distinction and the way this impacts upon educational opportunity and success. Nevertheless, there is much sensitivity shown towards students who encounter problems. The novels are valuable above all for their insight into the social and intellectual dynamics of academic communities. In this respect Stewart is much more insightful than [[C.P. Snow]], some of whose \"[[Strangers and Brothers]]\" novels from a previous era focus on similar bodies of people, and he is no less successful in plot-construction than his Cambridge counterpart.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Staircase In Surrey, A}}\n[[Category:20th-century British novels]]\n[[Category:Novel sequences]]\n[[Category:University of Oxford in fiction]]\n[[Category:1970s novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Oxford]]\n[[Category:Novels about writers]]\n[[Category:Campus novels]]\n[[Category:Scottish novels]]\n", "name_user": "91.125.146.188", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBackground:this also is pure original research)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Staircase_in_Surrey"}
