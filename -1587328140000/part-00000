This area continues to be the core of the system, and is noted for the number of residents in the Richmond Highway area who use the service at all times of the day. It had 10 routes, and many routes serves through [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington Station]]. These first 10 routes were previously served by Metrobus. In 1988, The Connector began to operate express routes, to connect to [[Pentagon station]]. It also expanded through the southeastern portion of Fairfax.<ref name=\"connector info\">{{Cite web| title = Fairfax County Transit Development Plan Fiscal Year 2016 \u2013 Fiscal Year 2022| accessdate = 2019-03-31| url = http://www.drpt.virginia.gov/media/1907/fairfax-county-tdp-2016.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1990, The Connector took over the operation of the RIBS (Reston Internal Bus Service). Service continues to provide through the southern portion of Alexandria, when [[Van Dorn Street station]] opened in 1991. In 1994, the service was extended to the high-technology industrial areas of [[suburb]]an [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]] and [[Herndon, Virginia|Herndon]], located between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].  Along [[State Route 267 (Virginia)|State Route 267]] (the Dulles Toll Road), express buses carry commuters from free park-and-ride lots to the [[Washington Metro]] system. In 1999, the Herndon-Monroe Park & Ride and the\nTysons Westpark Transit Station opened, extending its operation within the county.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAfter having many buses running on pure diesel, The Connector ordered buses that runs in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel\nfuel in 2002. These bus upgrades can retrofitting the fleet with Green Diesel technology, so the county can go environmentally friendly. More bus stations continues to increase, with the opening of the Lorton Park-and-Ride in 2003, and the Gambrill Road Park-and-Ride in 2005. The Connector began installing the SmarTrip Fare Card technology, so that passengers can pay their fare using WMATA's SmarTrip. In June 2009, service was transitioned from the Metrobus 2W, 12-, and 20-series routes to the Connector in the Centreville, Chantilly, and Oakton areas along I-66 and near [[Vienna station (Washington Metro)|Vienna/Fairfax-GMU Station]].\n\nOn July 1, 2009 [[MV Transportation]] took over from [[Veolia Transport]] as the operator.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190520052709/https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fairfax-county-to-sign-200m-connector-bus-service-contract Fairfax County to sign $200M Connector bus service contract] ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' March 30, 2009</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nMajor changes began in 2010, when the Reston East Park-and-Ride closed to make way for the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] construction.

This area continues to be the core of the system, and is noted for the number of residents in the Richmond Highway area who use the service at all times of the day. It had 10 routes, and many routes serves through [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington Station]]. These first 10 routes were previously served by Metrobus. In 1988, The Connector began to operate express routes, to connect to [[Pentagon station]]. It also expanded through the southeastern portion of Fairfax.<ref name=\"connector info\">{{Cite web| title = Fairfax County Transit Development Plan Fiscal Year 2016 \u2013 Fiscal Year 2022| accessdate = 2019-03-31| url = http://www.drpt.virginia.gov/media/1907/fairfax-county-tdp-2016.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1990, The Connector took over the operation of the RIBS (Reston Internal Bus Service). Service continues to provide through the southern portion of Alexandria, when [[Van Dorn Street station]] opened in 1991. In 1994, the service was extended to the high-technology industrial areas of [[suburb]]an [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]] and [[Herndon, Virginia|Herndon]], located between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].  Along [[State Route 267 (Virginia)|State Route 267]] (the Dulles Toll Road), express buses carry commuters from free park-and-ride lots to the [[Washington Metro]] system. In 1999, the Herndon-Monroe Park & Ride and the\nTysons Westpark Transit Station opened, extending its operation within the county.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAfter having many buses running on pure diesel, The Connector ordered buses that runs in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel\nfuel in 2002. These bus upgrades can retrofitting the fleet with Green Diesel technology, so the county can go environmentally friendly. More bus stations continues to increase, with the opening of the Lorton Park-and-Ride in 2003, and the Gambrill Road Park-and-Ride in 2005. The Connector began installing the SmarTrip Fare Card technology, so that passengers can pay their fare using WMATA's SmarTrip. In June 2009, service was transitioned from the Metrobus 2W, 12-, and 20-series routes to the Connector in the Centreville, Chantilly, and Oakton areas along I-66 and near [[Vienna station (Washington Metro)|Vienna/Fairfax-GMU Station]].\n\nOn July 1, 2009 [[MV Transportation]] took over from [[Veolia Transport]] as the operator.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190520052709/https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fairfax-county-to-sign-200m-connector-bus-service-contract Fairfax County to sign $200M Connector bus service contract] ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' March 30, 2009</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nMajor changes began in 2010, when the Reston East Park-and-Ride closed to make way for the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] construction. After the Silver Line opened in 2014, The Connector modified its service, by providing three circulator routes within Tysons Corner, as well as new service to McLean. Many routes were modified, so The Connector can give access to its riders to transfer within the Silver Line and other portions within the County.

It is suitable for hunting medium to large game animals in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]]. At a typical velocity of 720 m/s (2362 ft/s), its 286 gr (18.5 g) standard load balances [[recoil]] and power for effective use at up to about 250m (275 yds). The [[C.I.P.]] Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for the 9.3\u00d762mm is {{convert|390.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GunDigest - 9.3 x 62mm\">{{cite web|title=Greatest Cartridges: 9.3\u00d762 Mauser, Effective on About Everything|url=http://gundigest.com/reloading/greatest-cartridges-9-3x62-mauser-effective-on-about-everything|website=gundigest.com|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 9.3\u00d762mm was designed to fit into the [[Gewehr 98|Mauser 98]] [[bolt-action]] rifle.<ref name=\"GunDigest - 9.3 x 62mm\" /> European hunters and settlers in Africa often chose military rifles for their reliability and low cost, but colonial governments in Africa fearful of rebellions often banned military-caliber rifles and ammunition. The 9.3\u00d762mm was never a military cartridge and so never had this problem. Like their military counterparts, Mauser rifles chambered in 9.3\u00d762mm were relatively inexpensive and quite reliable. Because of these factors 9.3x62mm quickly became popular and usage of the cartridge became widespread.\n\nThe [[9.3\u00d774mmR]] is a rimmed cartridge that evolved from the 9.3\u00d772mmR [[black powder]] cartridge. The energy levels of the 9.3\u00d762mm and [[9.3\u00d774mmR]] cartridges are similar but the cartridges are unrelated. The rimmed cartridge is slightly longer than the 9.3x62mm, allowing for lower pressure in the case while retaining muzzle velocity and energy.\n\n==Ammunition==\nThe 9.3\u00d762mm was first loaded with a {{convert|18.5|g|gr|}} bullet at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 655&nbsp;m/s (2,150&nbsp;ft/s). After [[World War I]] some companies increased the velocity to around 730&nbsp;m/s (2,400&nbsp;ft/s), and brought out lighter bullets. Rifles set up for the original load must have their sights readjusted to shoot the newer load to point of aim. Adding to the confusion, loads at both velocities are available today. Several European firms load 9.3\u00d762mm ammunition, including [[Nammo|Lapua]], [[Norma (company)|Norma]], [[RUAG|RUAG Ammotech (RWS)]], [[SAKO]], and [[Prvi Partizan|Prvi Partizan (PPU)]] as well as [[Denel|Denel (PMP)]] of [[South Africa]], and it is widely available in [[Africa]].<ref name=\"Biggamehunting - 9.3 x 62mm Mauser\">{{cite web|title=The 9.3x62mm Mauser|url=http://thebiggamehuntingblog.com/2013/09/the-93x62mm-mauser-html/|website=thebiggamehuntingblog.com|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn [[England]], [[Kynoch]] the well-known cartridge manufacturer, produced ammunition, referring to the 9.3\u00d762mm as '9.3mm Mauser'. Typically it was loaded as 'Metal Covered Soft Nose Bullet', {{convert|18.5|g|gr}} with the base marked simply Kynoch 9.3&nbsp;mm. This is no longer listed by them.\n\n==Elsewhere==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\nIn several [[European countries]], the 9.3x62mm remains a popular cartridge for hunting game like moose and wild boar, and it is offered as a standard chambering in rifles from most makers there. The [[CZ-USA]] [[CZ 550]] rifle in 9.3x62mm chambering became available in [[North America]] in 2002, and both rifle and cartridge are gaining a strong following there, as the cartridge has a slight power edge over the popular [[.35 Whelen]] cartridge. In [[US]], several ammunition makers including [[Federal Premium Ammunition|Federal]], [[Hornady]], [[Nosler]], and Swift offer factory-loaded 9.3x62mm sporting ammunition. Since surplus Scandinavian and European Mausers were been brought to Canada in 9.3 calibre in the early 1950s, Canadian hunters have used the 9.3\u00d762mm cartridge to hunt large game in [[Canada]] including [[bison]], all the deer species, and large bears. In recent years, [[\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka firearms|CZ]] of [[Czech Republic]], as well as [[SAKO]] and Tikka of [[Finland]] have imported many 9.3x62mm rifles to [[Canada]] and [[US]] where demand continues to be high.\n\n==Adequacy==\nThe 9.3\u00d762mm is considered ideal for hunting the larger and tougher African game species, such as [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[gemsbok]]s, [[Common eland|eland]]s, and [[wildebeest]]s.

It is suitable for hunting medium to large game animals in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]]. At a typical velocity of 720 m/s (2362 ft/s), its 286 gr (18.5 g) standard load balances [[recoil]] and power for effective use at up to about 250m (275 yds). The [[C.I.P.]] Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for the 9.3\u00d762mm is {{convert|390.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GunDigest - 9.3 x 62mm\">{{cite web|title=Greatest Cartridges: 9.3\u00d762 Mauser, Effective on About Everything|url=http://gundigest.com/reloading/greatest-cartridges-9-3x62-mauser-effective-on-about-everything|website=gundigest.com|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 9.3\u00d762mm was designed to fit into the [[Gewehr 98|Mauser 98]] [[bolt-action]] rifle.<ref name=\"GunDigest - 9.3 x 62mm\" /> European hunters and settlers in Africa often chose military rifles for their reliability and low cost, but colonial governments in Africa fearful of rebellions often banned military-caliber rifles and ammunition. The 9.3\u00d762mm was never a military cartridge and so never had this problem. Like their military counterparts, Mauser rifles chambered in 9.3\u00d762mm were relatively inexpensive and quite reliable. Because of these factors 9.3x62mm quickly became popular and usage of the cartridge became widespread.\n\nThe [[9.3\u00d774mmR]] is a rimmed cartridge that evolved from the 9.3\u00d772mmR [[black powder]] cartridge. The energy levels of the 9.3\u00d762mm and [[9.3\u00d774mmR]] cartridges are similar but the cartridges are unrelated. The rimmed cartridge is slightly longer than the 9.3x62mm, allowing for lower pressure in the case while retaining muzzle velocity and energy.\n\n==Ammunition==\nThe 9.3\u00d762mm was first loaded with a {{convert|18.5|g|gr|}} bullet at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 655&nbsp;m/s (2,150&nbsp;ft/s). After [[World War I]] some companies increased the velocity to around 730&nbsp;m/s (2,400&nbsp;ft/s), and brought out lighter bullets. Rifles set up for the original load must have their sights readjusted to shoot the newer load to point of aim. Adding to the confusion, loads at both velocities are available today. Several European firms load 9.3\u00d762mm ammunition, including [[Nammo|Lapua]], [[Norma (company)|Norma]], RWS, [[SAKO]], and PPU (Prvi Partizan) as well as PMP of [[South Africa]], and it is widely available in [[Africa]].<ref name=\"Biggamehunting - 9.3 x 62mm Mauser\">{{cite web|title=The 9.3x62mm Mauser|url=http://thebiggamehuntingblog.com/2013/09/the-93x62mm-mauser-html/|website=thebiggamehuntingblog.com|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn [[England]], [[Kynoch]] the well-known cartridge manufacturer, produced ammunition, referring to the 9.3\u00d762mm as '9.3mm Mauser'. Typically it was loaded as 'Metal Covered Soft Nose Bullet', {{convert|18.5|g|gr}} with the base marked simply Kynoch 9.3&nbsp;mm. This is no longer listed by them.\n\n==Elsewhere==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\nIn several [[European countries]], the 9.3x62mm remains a popular cartridge for hunting game like moose and wild boar, and it is offered as a standard chambering in rifles from most makers there. The [[CZ-USA]] [[CZ 550]] rifle in 9.3x62mm chambering became available in [[North America]] in 2002, and both rifle and cartridge are gaining a strong following there, as the cartridge has a slight power edge over the popular [[.35 Whelen]] cartridge. In [[US]], several ammunition makers including [[Federal Premium Ammunition|Federal]], [[Hornady]], [[Nosler]], and Swift offer factory-loaded 9.3x62mm sporting ammunition. Since surplus Scandinavian and European Mausers were been brought to Canada in 9.3 calibre in the early 1950s, Canadian hunters have used the 9.3\u00d762mm cartridge to hunt large game in [[Canada]] including [[bison]], all the deer species, and large bears. In recent years, [[\u010cesk\u00e1 Zbrojovka firearms|CZ]] of [[Czech Republic]], as well as [[SAKO]] and Tikka of [[Finland]] have imported many 9.3x62mm rifles to [[Canada]] and [[US]] where demand continues to be high.\n\n==Adequacy==\nThe 9.3\u00d762mm is considered ideal for hunting the larger and tougher African game species, such as [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[gemsbok]]s, [[Common eland|eland]]s, and [[wildebeest]]s. Most hunters consider it a viable all-around cartridge comparable to [[.338 Winchester Magnum]], [[9.3\u00d764mm Brenneke]], and [[.375 H&H Magnum]]. The 9.3\u00d762mm has taken cleanly every dangerous game species in [[Africa]].

She made her acting debut in the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982), in 1986 she starred in the thriller ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), which proved to be one of her first box office hits. While the fantasy comedy ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) brought her to international prominence, the drama ''[[The Accidental Tourist (film)|The Accidental Tourist]]'' (also 1988) earned her the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. That same year, she also starred in ''[[Earth Girls are Easy]]'', which was not a box office success.  She cemented her leading actress status with her performance in the road film ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' (1991), receiving a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Later she starred in '' [[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), which proved to be a critical and box office success, earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination. Davis's roles in the box office failures ''[[Cutthroat Island]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'' (1996), both directed by then-husband [[Renny Harlin]], were followed by a lengthy break and downturn in her career.\n\nDavis starred as the adoptive mother of the titular character in the [[Stuart Little (film)|''Stuart Little'' franchise]] (1999\u20132005) and as the first female president of the United States in the television series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' (2005\u20132006), winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her role in the latter. Her later films include ''[[Accidents Happen]]'' (2009) and ''[[Marjorie Prime]]'' (2017). She has portrayed the recurring role of Dr. Nicole Herman in ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2014\u20132015, 2018), and also starred as [[Regan MacNeil]]/Angela Rance in the first season of the horror television series ''[[The Exorcist (TV series)|The Exorcist]]'' (2017).\n\nIn 2004, Davis launched the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], which works collaboratively with the entertainment industry to dramatically increase the presence of female characters in media. Through the organization, she launched the annual [[Bentonville Film Festival]] in 2015, and executive produced the documentary ''[[This Changes Everything (2018 film)|This Changes Everything]]'' in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, in recognition of her work for gender equality, Davis received the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/news/academy-honor-geena-davis-david-lynch-wes-studi-and-lina-wertmuller-2019-governors-awards|title=The Academy To Honor Geena Davis, David Lunch, Wes Studi and Lina Wertm\u00fcller at 2019 Governors Awards|date=2019-06-03|work=AMPAS|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDavis was born January 21, 1956, in [[Wareham, Massachusetts]].

She made her acting debut in the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982), in 1986 she starred in the thriller ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), which proved to be one of her first box office hits. While the fantasy comedy ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) brought her to international prominence, the drama ''[[The Accidental Tourist (film)|The Accidental Tourist]]'' (also 1988) earned her the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. That same year, she also starred in ''[[Earth Girls are Easy]]'', which was not a box office success.  She cemented her leading actress status with her performance in the road film ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' (1991), receiving a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Later she starred in '' [[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), which proved to be a critical and box office success, earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination.

Through the organization, she launched the annual [[Bentonville Film Festival]] in 2015, and executive produced the documentary ''[[This Changes Everything (2018 film)|This Changes Everything]]'' in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, in recognition of her work for gender equality, Davis received the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/news/academy-honor-geena-davis-david-lynch-wes-studi-and-lina-wertmuller-2019-governors-awards|title=The Academy To Honor Geena Davis, David Lunch, Wes Studi and Lina Wertm\u00fcller at 2019 Governors Awards|date=2019-06-03|work=AMPAS|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDavis was born January 21, 1956, in [[Wareham, Massachusetts]].

The Deaf communities of the Indian subcontinent are still struggling for IPSL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in the Indian subcontinent, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes. In 2005, the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students. [[NCERT]] in March 2006 published  a chapter on sign language in a class III textbook, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the [[differently abled]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nStrenuous efforts have been made by [[Deaf communities]], NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for people with hearing disabilities , including the All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging IPSL. Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching IPSL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing and the Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established an IPSL cell. It started a course called \"Diploma in Sign Language Interpreter Course\". The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communication in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of the [[Deaf community]] and [[Deaf culture]]. Later, the course was offered in the regional centers, in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like the Mook Badhir Sangathan in [[Indore]] and several other organisations offer IPSL classes. Many NGOs all over the India use IPSL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These NGOs include ISHARA ([[Mumbai]]), Deaf Way Foundation ([[Delhi]]), the Noida Deaf Society and Leadership Education Empowerment of the Deaf (LEED) ([[Pune]]), Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf ([[Punjab]]), etc. (Randhawa, 2014). The associations like the Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and the Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of [[Interpreters]] in India. Two schools have been established in India which follow [[bilingual]] approach to teach deaf students. The schools are the [[Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL)]] in Dehradun and [[Mook Badhir Sangathan]] in Indore. Apart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India.  Recent research developments include the studies by research scholars of the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] (JNU) and the [[University of Delhi ]] including Wallang, 2007; Sinha, 2003,2008/2013; Hidam, 2010; Kulsheshtra, 2013. There is also work on problems and awareness of IPSL and typology of IPSL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010). Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of IPSL as well as on varieties of IPSL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012). Steps taken by the Government of India to promote sign language include the establishment of the [[ISLRTC]]. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, which is yet to be resolved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Varieties==\nThere are many [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of sign language in the region, including many pockets of [[home sign]] and local sign languages, such as [[Ghandruk Sign Language]], [[Jhankot Sign Language]], and [[Jumla Sign Language]] in Nepal, and [[Alipur Sign Language]] in India, which appear to be [[language isolates]]. There are also various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal ([[Nepalese Sign Language]]), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for [[Nepalese Sign Language]] at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n* Woodward (1992a) researched the vocabulary of the sign language varieties in [[Karachi]] ([[Sindh]], Pakistan), [[Delhi]] (NCT, India), [[Bombay]] ([[Maharashtra]], India), [[Bangalore]] ([[Karnataka]], India) and [[Calcutta]] ([[West Bengal]], India). He found cognacy rates of 62\u201371% between the Karachi vocabulary on the one hand and the four Indian vocabularies on the other, and concluded that 'sign language varieties in India and Pakistan are distinct but closely related language varieties belonging to the same language family'.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last= Woodward\n| first= J\n| year = 1993\n| title = The relationship of sign language varieties in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n| journal= Sign Language Studies\n| volume= 1078\n| issue= 78\n| pages= 15\u201322| doi= 10.1353/sls.1993.0010\n}}</ref>\n* Woodward (1993) expanded on his 1992 research by comparing the results from India and Pakistan with new data from Nepal, tentatively concluding that the sign language varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal and probably also Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are so closely related that they may, in fact, constitute a single sign language.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beninca |first=Paola (ed.) |date=2011 |title=Mapping the Left Periphery: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, Volume 5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&lr=&id=xntYynYfjngC&oi=fnd&pg=PA105 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=105 |isbn=9780199842315 |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n* Zeshan (2000), based on her own research in Karachi and [[New Delhi]] concluding that their grammar was identical and there were only small differences in vocabulary, proposed that the Indian and Pakistani varieties constitute a single language, introduced the term 'Indo-Pakistani Sign Language' and emphatically rejected the notion of separate Indian and Pakistani sign languages.<ref name=Zeshan/>\n* The [[ISO 639-3]] standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. ''Ethnologue'' (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.<ref>{{citation \n|chapter= Indian Sign Language\n|title= Ethnologue\n|edition= 19\n|date= 2016\n|accessdate= 23 October 2016\n|publisher= SIL International\n|chapter-url= http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ins\n}}</ref> They identify the following dialects within India: Bangalore-Chennai-Hyderabad Sign Language, Mumbai-Delhi Sign Language and  Kolkata Sign Language.\n\n* Johnson and Johnson (2016)<ref name=\"JohnsonJohnson2016\">{{cite journal\n|last1=  Johnson\n|first1= Russell J.\n|last2=  Johnson\n|first2= Jane E.\n|year=   2016\n|title=  Distinction between West Bengal Sign Language, and Indian Sign Language Based on Statistical Assessment\n|journal= Sign Language Studies\n|volume= 16\n|issue= 4\n|pages= 473\u2013499\n|url= http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/SLS/SLS16-4.html#bengalsl\n|doi= 10.1353/sls.2016.0016\n}}</ref> argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.\n\nWhile the sign system in IPSL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in IPSL are derived from [[British Sign Language]]. For example, most IPSL signers nowadays use [[fingerspelling]] based on [[British Sign Language]] [[fingerspelling]], with only isolated groups using an indigenous [[devanagari]]-based [[fingerspelling]] system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in [[Vadodara]]/Baroda, [[Gujarat]]). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from [[American Sign Language]]. A small number of the Deaf in and around [[Bengaluru]] are often said to use [[American Sign Language]] (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or [[Signed English]]), while incorporating also a not inconsequential IPSL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly IPSL and not ASL.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Delhi Association for the Deaf is reportedly working with [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] to identify a standard sign language for India.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title = Standard sign language for the deaf in India soon\n|url = http://www.deaftoday.com/v3/archives/2004/09/standard_sign_l.html\n|location = New Delhi\n|publisher = Hindustan Times\n|date = 16 September 2004\n|agency=Press Trust of India\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216074932/http://www.deaftoday.com/v3/archives/2004/09/standard_sign_l.html\n|archivedate=16 February 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough discussion of sign languages and the lives of deaf people is extremely rare in the history of South Asian literature, there are a few references to deaf people and gestural communication in texts dating from antiquity.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/bibweb/Miles/Miles.html\n |accessdate  = 6 May 2007\n |year        = 2001\n |author      = M.

These schools included The Bombay Institution for Deaf-Mutes, which was founded by Bishop [[Leo Meurin]] in the 1880s,<ref>Hull, Ernest R.

The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at [[Dacca]], [[Barisal]] and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = H.C. | year = 1928 | title = The sign language of deaf-mutes | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 69\u201387 }} (quote from p.70)</ref> She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in [[Palayamkottai]] in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning [[Tamil language|Tamil]], as those do who belong to the [[Madras Presidency]], or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"<ref>Swainson, Florence (1906). \"Report of the Deaf and Dumb and Industrial School in connection with the Church of England Zenana Mission, Palamcottah, South India, for 1905\". Palamcottah: Church Mission Press. p.9</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\nDespite the common assumption that Indo-Pakistani Sign Language is the manual representation of spoken English or Hindi, it is in fact unrelated to either language and has its own grammar. Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of IPSL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of IPSL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in IPSL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by \u20181+0\u2019. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for \u2018male/man\u2019 and \u2018female/woman\u2019.\n\nE.g.: \n    i) BROTHER: MAN + SIBLING \n    \n    ii) SISTER: WOMAN + SIBLING\n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\nE.g.: \n    i)PASS and FAIL \u2013 The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.\n    \n    ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH \u2013 They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.\n   \n    iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND \u2013 The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.\n\n4) The IPSL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n5)  There is no temporal inflection in IPSL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n  i) English: Where is the bank?\n     IPSL    : BANK WHERE\n    \n ii) English: Who is sick?\n     IPSL    : SICK WHO\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of IPSL.\n\n{{quote|Sentences are always [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE \u2013 \"(My) father died yesterday\").<ref>Zeshan, U.

The Deaf communities of the Indian subcontinent are still struggling for IPSL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in the Indian subcontinent, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes. In 2005, the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students. [[NCERT]] in March 2006 published  a chapter on sign language in a class III textbook, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the [[differently abled]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nStrenuous efforts have been made by [[Deaf communities]], NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for people with hearing disabilities , including the All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging IPSL. Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching IPSL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing and the Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established an IPSL cell. It started a course called \"Diploma in Sign Language Interpreter Course\". The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communication in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of the [[Deaf community]] and [[Deaf culture]]. Later, the course was offered in the regional centers, in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like the Mook Badhir Sangathan in [[Indore]] and several other organisations offer IPSL classes. Many NGOs all over the India use IPSL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These NGOs include ISHARA ([[Mumbai]]), Deaf Way Foundation ([[Delhi]]), the Noida Deaf Society and Leadership Education Empowerment of the Deaf (LEED) ([[Pune]]), Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf ([[Punjab]]), etc. (Randhawa, 2014). The associations like the Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and the Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of [[Interpreters]] in India. Two schools have been established in India which follow [[bilingual]] approach to teach deaf students. The schools are the [[Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL)]] in Dehradun and [[Mook Badhir Sangathan]] in Indore. Apart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India.  Recent research developments include the studies by research scholars of the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] (JNU) and the [[University of Delhi ]] including Wallang, 2007; Sinha, 2003,2008/2013; Hidam, 2010; Kulsheshtra, 2013. There is also work on problems and awareness of IPSL and typology of IPSL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010). Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of IPSL as well as on varieties of IPSL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012). Steps taken by the Government of India to promote sign language include the establishment of the [[ISLRTC]]. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, which is yet to be resolved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Varieties==\nThere are many [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of sign language in the region, including many pockets of [[home sign]] and local sign languages, such as [[Ghandruk Sign Language]], [[Jhankot Sign Language]], and [[Jumla Sign Language]] in Nepal, and [[Alipur Sign Language]] in India, which appear to be [[language isolates]]. There are also various [[Sri Lankan sign languages]] which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal ([[Nepalese Sign Language]]), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for [[Nepalese Sign Language]] at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n* Woodward (1992a) researched the vocabulary of the sign language varieties in [[Karachi]] ([[Sindh]], Pakistan), [[Delhi]] (NCT, India), [[Bombay]] ([[Maharashtra]], India), [[Bangalore]] ([[Karnataka]], India) and [[Calcutta]] ([[West Bengal]], India). He found cognacy rates of 62\u201371% between the Karachi vocabulary on the one hand and the four Indian vocabularies on the other, and concluded that 'sign language varieties in India and Pakistan are distinct but closely related language varieties belonging to the same language family'.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last= Woodward\n| first= J\n| year = 1993\n| title = The relationship of sign language varieties in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n| journal= Sign Language Studies\n| volume= 1078\n| issue= 78\n| pages= 15\u201322| doi= 10.1353/sls.1993.0010\n}}</ref>\n* Woodward (1993) expanded on his 1992 research by comparing the results from India and Pakistan with new data from Nepal, tentatively concluding that the sign language varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal and probably also Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are so closely related that they may, in fact, constitute a single sign language.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Beninca |first=Paola (ed.) |date=2011 |title=Mapping the Left Periphery: The Cartography of Syntactic Structures, Volume 5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&lr=&id=xntYynYfjngC&oi=fnd&pg=PA105 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=105 |isbn=9780199842315 |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n* Zeshan (2000), based on her own research in Karachi and [[New Delhi]] concluding that their grammar was identical and there were only small differences in vocabulary, proposed that the Indian and Pakistani varieties constitute a single language, introduced the term 'Indo-Pakistani Sign Language' and emphatically rejected the notion of separate Indian and Pakistani sign languages.<ref name=Zeshan/>\n* The [[ISO 639-3]] standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. ''Ethnologue'' (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.<ref>{{citation \n|chapter= Indian Sign Language\n|title= Ethnologue\n|edition= 19\n|date= 2016\n|accessdate= 23 October 2016\n|publisher= SIL International\n|chapter-url= http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ins\n}}</ref> They identify the following dialects within India: Bangalore-Chennai-Hyderabad Sign Language, Mumbai-Delhi Sign Language and  Kolkata Sign Language.\n\n* Johnson and Johnson (2016)<ref name=\"JohnsonJohnson2016\">{{cite journal\n|last1=  Johnson\n|first1= Russell J.\n|last2=  Johnson\n|first2= Jane E.\n|year=   2016\n|title=  Distinction between West Bengal Sign Language, and Indian Sign Language Based on Statistical Assessment\n|journal= Sign Language Studies\n|volume= 16\n|issue= 4\n|pages= 473\u2013499\n|url= http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/SLS/SLS16-4.html#bengalsl\n|doi= 10.1353/sls.2016.0016\n}}</ref> argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.\n\nWhile the sign system in IPSL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in IPSL are derived from [[British Sign Language]]. For example, most IPSL signers nowadays use [[fingerspelling]] based on [[British Sign Language]] [[fingerspelling]], with only isolated groups using an indigenous [[devanagari]]-based [[fingerspelling]] system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in [[Vadodara]]/Baroda, [[Gujarat]]). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from [[American Sign Language]]. A small number of the Deaf in and around [[Bengaluru]] are often said to use [[American Sign Language]] (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or [[Signed English]]), while incorporating also a not inconsequential IPSL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly IPSL and not ASL.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Delhi Association for the Deaf is reportedly working with [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] to identify a standard sign language for India.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title = Standard sign language for the deaf in India soon\n|url = http://www.deaftoday.com/v3/archives/2004/09/standard_sign_l.html\n|location = New Delhi\n|publisher = Hindustan Times\n|date = 16 September 2004\n|agency=Press Trust of India\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216074932/http://www.deaftoday.com/v3/archives/2004/09/standard_sign_l.html\n|archivedate=16 February 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough discussion of sign languages and the lives of deaf people is extremely rare in the history of South Asian literature, there are a few references to deaf people and gestural communication in texts dating from antiquity.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/bibweb/Miles/Miles.html\n |accessdate  = 6 May 2007\n |year        = 2001\n |author      = M.

These schools included The Bombay Institution for Deaf-Mutes, which was founded by Bishop [[Leo Meurin]] in the 1880s,<ref>Hull, Ernest R.

The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at [[Dacca]], [[Barisal]] and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = H.C. | year = 1928 | title = The sign language of deaf-mutes | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 69\u201387 }} (quote from p.70)</ref> She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in [[Palayamkottai]] in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning [[Tamil language|Tamil]], as those do who belong to the [[Madras Presidency]], or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"<ref>Swainson, Florence (1906). \"Report of the Deaf and Dumb and Industrial School in connection with the Church of England Zenana Mission, Palamcottah, South India, for 1905\". Palamcottah: Church Mission Press. p.9</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\nDespite the common assumption that Indo-Pakistani Sign Language is the manual representation of spoken English or Hindi, it is in fact unrelated to either language and has its own grammar. Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of IPSL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of IPSL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in IPSL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by \u20181+0\u2019. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for \u2018male/man\u2019 and \u2018female/woman\u2019.\n\nE.g.: \n    i) BROTHER: MAN + SIBLING \n    \n    ii) SISTER: WOMAN + SIBLING\n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\nE.g.: \n    i)PASS and FAIL \u2013 The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.\n    \n    ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH \u2013 They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.\n   \n    iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND \u2013 The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.\n\n4) The IPSL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n5)  There is no temporal inflection in IPSL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n  i) English: Where is the bank?\n     IPSL    : BANK WHERE\n    \n ii) English: Who is sick?\n     IPSL    : SICK WHO\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of IPSL.\n\n{{quote|Sentences are always [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE \u2013 \"(My) father died yesterday\").<ref>Zeshan, U.
