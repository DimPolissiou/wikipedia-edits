Under the guidance of the workman Ramaswamy (Munnar Ramesh) and archenemy of his father, he became a construction worker against his father's will. With the money obtained from his hard work, he went to watch his favourite star's films.\n\nMany years later, Velu (Ravi) and his friend Kulanji (R. Sivakumar) have become wastrels: they drink alcohol and have sex with prostitutes. When the village girl Kalaiselvi (Aswatha), the daughter of Ramaswamy, attained puberty, Velu falls under her spell and tries to woo her. She eventually falls in love with him. Ramaswamy wants his relative Durai to marry his daughter and decides to arrange their wedding, but Kalaiselvi does not want to wed him. Thereafter, Velu sleeps with Kalaiselvi and gives her money for the service. Kalaiselvi is astonished for being in love with a cold-hearted man. A villager witnesses it, the news is spread like wildfire, and people begin to talk ill about them. Ramaswamy complains to the police that Velu raped his daughter, and Velu is arrested. At the police, Kalaiselvi confesses that it was a consensual act; therefore, Velu is released from jail. Fearing of losing her daughter, Kalaiselvi's mother makes her leave the village. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy's relatives plan to kill Velu.\n\nKalaiselvi starts working in a cotton factory in a remote village, whereas Velu realises his mistakes. Velu tries to compromise with Ramaswamy and asks him to get married to his daughter, and Ramaswamy surprisingly accepts. The day of the marriage, Velu's father drinks poison to stop it, and Velu could not attend his marriage. Ramaswamy then forces Kalaiselvi to get married to a drunkard. In addition to that, Velu's family rejects him; hence, Velu becomes depressed and commits suicide.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*Ravi as Velu\n*Aswatha as Kalaiselvi\n*Munnar Ramesh as Ramaswamy\n*R.

Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman, Pepi Popp, designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe team played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], the later venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship,<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref> and in 1931, when it became Kreisliga Unterfranken champion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreisliga Bayern 1931|trans-title=1931 Kreisliga Bayern|publisher=fussball-historie.de|url=http://www.fussball-historie.de/Sued/OstkreisII1931.html|accessdate=10 April 2020|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nAfter introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round.\n \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled, and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry.

Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905'' was founded on 5 May 1905 by a group of sports enthusiasts. The club's first chairman, Pepi Popp, designed the still unchanged FC 05 crest.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> \n\nThe team played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. Back  then, the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], the later venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship,<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref> and in 1931, when it became Kreisliga Unterfranken champion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kreisliga Bayern 1931|trans-title=1931 Kreisliga Bayern|publisher=fussball-historie.de|url=http://www.fussball-historie.de/Sued/OstkreisII1931.html|accessdate=10 April 2020|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nAfter introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round.\n \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later, and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2.

Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled, and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

With the introduction of the [[Regionalliga]]s in 1994 and the [[3. Liga]] in 2008 as the new third tier, below the [[2. Bundesliga]], all leagues below dropped one tier. With the establishment of the [[Regionalliga Bayern]] as the new fourth tier in Bavaria in 2012 the [[Bayernliga]] was split into a northern and a southern division, the number of Landesligas expanded from three to five and the Bezirksoberligas were abolished. All leagues from the Bezirksligas onward were elevated one tier.\n\n===Reserve team===\nThe recent season-by-season performance of the U23 reserve.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

The album was recorded inside Blackburn Castle in [[New South Wales]] over the first half of 2010, and was produced with the help of [[Burke Reid]]. The songs consist entirely of Liddiard's acoustic guitar-playing and singing, with lyrics that are predominantly narrative.<ref name=q/><ref name=smh/> Its lyrical content was characterized as \"dark and grinding\" and is set in various periods of time as well as locations. A video was also made for the title track.\n\nReleased through [[Shock Records]] and [[ATP Recordings]], the album received critical acclaim from the Australian press, and (despite being scant) a very favourable critical reception outside Australia. It was nominated for an [[ARIA Award for Best Male Artist]] at the [[ARIA Music Awards|25th ARIA Music Awards]] and the [[Australian Music Prize]].\n\n==Content==\n\n=== Style ===\nDaniel Baker of ''[[The Quietus]]'' described the album as \"a deceptive subversion of [[rockist]] dogma.\" He describes the tracks as \"sprawling venom inflected dioramas existent in their own haunted ecology.\"<ref name=q>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/05594-gareth-liddiard-strange-tourist-review|title=The Quietus \u2013 Reviews \u2013 Gareth Liddiard|website=The Quietus}}</ref> \"With his first solo album,\" wrote Bernard Zuel of ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', \"Liddiard puts aside the physical presence of the Drones, forgoing that capacity for movement as well as variation in favour of none-more-bare presentations of voice and guitar.

He compared the album unfavorably to Liddiard's work with The Drones (\"Australia's greatest fucking rock band living [...]\") and wrote that the songs \"are not Drones songs. [...] These songs are Gareth Liddiard songs.\" He criticized the length of the songs as being \"about five minutes too long\", the lack of variety in them, and whilst he praised the lyrics (\"He can write the fuck out of a song. He can tell the fuck out of a story. He's fascinated by Australian folklore, and can turn that fascination into further fascination for those not so inclined [...]\"), he criticized the music as being \"rambling, unfocused, the guitar all plucked arpeggios and breaks for reflection, but not in a meaningful way\", using the track \"Blondin Makes an Omelette\" as an example of the latter two. Despite this, he praised \"The Radicalisation of D\", \"which has dynamics, and power, and the odd scream, and pretty much everything else you\u2019d expect from The Drones\u2019 frontman\", as \"16 minutes of genius that gradually sucks you in until you\u2019re tightly bound to what's unfolding in front of your ears [...]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Awards===\nThe album earned Liddiard a nomination for an [[ARIA Award for Best Male Artist]] at the [[ARIA Music Awards|25th ARIA Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/award/best-male-artist|title=Aria Awards|website=ariaawards.com.au}}</ref> In response to the nomination, Liddiard stated: \"It's just for wankers, snorting coke and getting drunk.

He can tell the fuck out of a story. He's fascinated by Australian folklore, and can turn that fascination into further fascination for those not so inclined [...]\"), he criticized the music as being \"rambling, unfocused, the guitar all plucked arpeggios and breaks for reflection, but not in a meaningful way\", using the track \"Blondin Makes an Omelette\" as an example of the latter two. Despite this, he praised \"The Radicalisation of D\", \"which has dynamics, and power, and the odd scream, and pretty much everything else you\u2019d expect from The Drones\u2019 frontman\", as \"16 minutes of genius that gradually sucks you in until you\u2019re tightly bound to what's unfolding in front of your ears [...]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Awards===\nThe album earned Liddiard a nomination for an [[ARIA Award for Best Male Artist]] at the [[ARIA Music Awards|25th ARIA Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/award/best-male-artist|title=Aria Awards|website=ariaawards.com.au}}</ref> In response to the nomination, Liddiard stated: \"It's just for wankers, snorting coke and getting drunk.

He was among the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s.\n\nKeres narrowly missed a chance at a [[World Chess Championship|world championship]] match on five occasions. He won the 1938 [[AVRO 1938 chess tournament|AVRO tournament]], which led to negotiations for a title match against champion [[Alexander Alekhine]], but the match never took place due to [[World War II]]. After the war Keres was runner-up in the [[Candidates' Tournament]] on four consecutive occasions.\n\nDue to these and other strong results, many chess historians consider Keres one of the greatest players in history, and the strongest player never to become [[World Chess Champion|world champion]]. He was nicknamed \"Paul the Second\", \"The Eternal Second\" and \"The [[Crown Prince]] of Chess\".<ref>David Hooper, Ken Whyld, Kenneth Whyld, ''The Oxford Companion to Chess'', Oxford University Press 1992, page 198</ref> Keres, [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and [[Alexander Beliavsky]] defeated nine world champions\u2014more than anyone else in history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Paul Keres.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Keres c. 1938]]\nKeres was born in [[Narva]] (then under supremacy of [[Russian Empire]], now [[Estonia]]).\n\nKeres first learned about chess from his father and his older brother [[Harald Keres|Harald]] (afterwards a prominent [[physicist]], who later\ntold friendly jokes to his students: \"I am not Paul's brother; Paul is my brother.\"). With the scarcity of chess literature in his small town, he learned about [[chess notation]] from the [[chess puzzle]]s in the daily newspaper, and compiled a handwritten collection of almost 1000 games.<ref>Paul Keres, Grandmaster of Chess: The Complete Games of Paul Keres, ed. and trans. by Harry Golombek, Arco, New York, 1977.</ref> In his early days, he was known for a brilliant and sharp attacking style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zone.ee/pkeres/partiid.php |title=Paul Keres |publisher=Zone.ee |accessdate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224153204/http://www.zone.ee/pkeres/partiid.php |archivedate=February 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKeres was a three-time Estonian schoolboy champion, in 1930, 1932, and 1933. His playing matured after playing [[correspondence chess]] extensively while in high school. He probably played about 500 correspondence games, and at one stage had 150 correspondence games going simultaneously. In 1935, he won the [[Internationaler Fernschachbund]] (IFSB) international correspondence chess championship. From 1937 to 1941 he studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Tartu]], and competed in several interuniversity matches.<ref>''Grandmaster of Chess: The Complete Games of Paul Keres'', by Paul Keres, edited and translated by [[Harry Golombek]], Arco, New York, 1977</ref>\n\n==Pre-war years==\nKeres achieved a very good result at the age of 17 in a Master tournament at [[Tallinn]] 1933 with 5/7  (+5\u22122=0), tied 3rd\u20134th, half a point behind joint winners [[Paul Felix Schmidt]] and V. Kappe.<ref>rogerpaige.me.uk/tables4.htm</ref> Keres became [[Estonian Chess Championship|champion of Estonia]] for the first time in 1935. He tied for first (+5\u22122=1) with [[Gunnar Friedemann]] in the tournament, then defeated him (+2\u22121=0) in the playoff match. In April 1935, Keres defeated [[Feliks Kibbermann]], one of [[Tartu]]'s leading masters, in a training match, by (+3\u22121=0).<ref>''Grandmaster of Chess'', by Paul Keres, Arco 1972, pp 188\u201389</ref>\n\nKeres played on {{chessgloss|first board|top board}} for Estonia in the 6th [[Chess Olympiad]] at [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]] 1935, and was regarded as the new star, admired for his dashing style. His success there gave him the confidence to venture onto the international circuit.\n\nAt [[Helsinki]] 1935, he placed 2nd behind [[Paulino Frydman|Paulin Frydman]] with 6\u00bd/8 (+6\u22121=1). He won at [[Tallinn]] 1936 with 9/10 (+8\u22120=2). Keres' first major international success against top-level competition came at [[Bad Nauheim]] 1936, where he tied for first with [[Alexander Alekhine]] at 6\u00bd/9 (+4\u22120=5). He struggled at [[Dresden, Germany|Dresden]] 1936, placing only 8\u20139th with (+2\u22124=3), but wrote that he learned an important lesson from this setback. Keres recovered at [[Zandvoort]] 1936 with a shared 3rd\u20134th place (+5\u22123=3). He then defended his Estonian title in 1936 by drawing a challenge match against [[Paul Felix Schmidt]] with (+3\u22123=1).<ref name=\"chessmetrics\">http://www.chessmetrics.com, the Paul Keres results file</ref>\n\nKeres had a series of successes in 1937. He won in Tallinn with 7\u00bd/9 (+6\u22120=3), then shared 1st\u20132nd at [[Margate, England|Margate]] with [[Reuben Fine]] at 7\u00bd/9 (+6\u22120=3), 1\u00bd points ahead of Alekhine. In [[Ostend]], he tied 1st\u20133rd places with Fine and [[Henry Grob]] at 6/9 (+5\u22122=2). Keres dominated in [[Prague]] to claim first with 10/11 (+9\u22120=2). He then won a theme tournament in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] with 4\u00bd/6 (+4\u22121=1); the tournament saw all games commence with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 Ne4, known as the D\u00f6ry Defence. He tied for 4\u20135th places at [[Kemeri]] with 11\u00bd/17 (+8\u22122=7), as [[Salo Flohr]], [[Vladimirs Petrovs]] and [[Samuel Reshevsky]] won. Then he tied 2nd\u20134th in [[P\u00e4rnu]] with 4\u00bd/7 (+3\u22121=3).\n\nThis successful string earned him an invitation to the tournament at [[Semmering, Austria|Semmering]]\u2013[[Baden]] 1937, which he won with 9/14 (+6\u22122=6), ahead of Fine, [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], Reshevsky, and [[Erich Eliskases]]. Keres, in his autobiographical games collection, refers to this major event as a 'Candidates' Tournament', and claimed that he was recognized as a Grandmaster after winning it,<ref>''Grandmaster of Chess: The Complete Games of Paul Keres'', by Paul Keres, edited and translated by [[Harry Golombek]], New York, ARCO Publishing 1972</ref> although its parallel connection with later [[FIDE]]-organized Candidates' tournaments (from 1950 onwards) is not exact, and the Grandmaster title was not formalized by FIDE until 1950.\n\nKeres tied for second at [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] 1937\u201338 with 6\u00bd/9 (+4\u22120=5) (half a point behind Reshevsky), and at [[Noordwijk]] 1938 (behind Eliskases) with 6\u00bd/9 (+4\u22120=5). Keres drew an exhibition match at [[Stockholm]] 1938 with [[Gideon St\u00e5hlberg]] on 4\u20134 (+2\u22122=4).<ref name=\"chessmetrics\" />\n\nHe continued to represent Estonia with success in Olympiad play. His detailed results for Estonia follow. Of note was the team bronze medal attained by Estonia in 1939; this was exceptional for a country with a population of less than two million people.<ref>http://www.olimpbase.org/players/cq6agwkb.html (1935, 1937, 1939 results); ''Grandmaster of Chess'', by Paul Keres, translated by Harry Golombek, New York, ARCO Publishing 1972, p. 188 (1936 results)</ref>\n* [[6th Chess Olympiad|Warsaw 1935]], Estonia board 1, 12\u00bd/19 (+11\u22125=3);\n* [[3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad|Munich 1936]] (unofficial Olympiad), Estonia board 1, 15\u00bd/20 (+12\u22121=7), board gold medal;\n* [[7th Chess Olympiad|Stockholm 1937]], Estonia board 1, 11/15 (+9\u22122=4), board silver medal;\n* [[8th Chess Olympiad|Buenos Aires 1939]], Estonia board 1, 14\u00bd/19 (+12\u22122=5), team bronze medal.\n\n==World Championship match denied==\nIn 1938 he tied with Fine for first, with 8\u00bd/14, in the all-star [[AVRO tournament]], held in various cities in the Netherlands, ahead of chess legends [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Max Euwe]], Reshevsky, Alekhine, Capablanca and Flohr. AVRO was one of the strongest tournaments in history; some chess historians believe it the strongest ever staged. Keres won on tiebreak because he beat Fine 1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd in their individual two games.\n\nIt was expected that the winner of this tournament would be the challenger for the [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] title, in a match against World Champion [[Alexander Alekhine]], but the outbreak of the Second World War, especially because of the first occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940\u201341, brought negotiations with Alekhine to an end. Keres had begun his university studies in 1937, and this also played a role in the failed match.\n\nKeres struggled at [[Leningrad]]\u2013Moscow 1939 with a shared 12\u201313th place; he wrote that he had not had enough time to prepare for this very strong event, where he faced many Soviet stars for the first time. But he recovered with more preparation time, and won Margate 1939 with 7\u00bd/9 (+6\u22120=3), ahead of Capablanca and Flohr.<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/>\n\n==World War II==\nAt the outbreak of [[World War II]], Keres was in [[Buenos Aires]] for the Olympiad. He stayed on to play in a Buenos Aires international tournament after the Olympiad, and tied for first place with [[Miguel Najdorf]] with 8\u00bd/11 (+7\u22121=3).\n\nHis next event was a 14-game match with former World Champion [[Max Euwe]] in the Netherlands, held from December 1939 \u2013 January 1940. Keres won a hard-fought struggle by 7\u00bd\u20136\u00bd (+6\u22125=3). This was a superb achievement, because not only was Euwe a former World Champion, but he had enormous experience at match play, far more than Keres.\n\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] having been concluded on August 23, 1939, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union on August 6, 1940. Keres played in his first Soviet Championship at Moscow 1940 (URS-ch12), placing fourth (+9\u22124=6) in an exceptionally strong field, placing him ahead of the defending champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], among others. The [[Soviet Chess Federation]] organized the \"Absolute Championship of the USSR\" in 1941, with the top six finishers from the 1940 championship meeting each other four times; it was split between [[Leningrad]] and Moscow. Botvinnik won the event, one of the strongest ever organized, with 13\u00bd/20, and Keres placed second with 11, ahead of [[Vasily Smyslov]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Andor Lilienthal]], and [[Igor Bondarevsky]].\n\nWith the [[Nazi]] invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, Estonia came under German control soon afterwards. During 1942 and 1943, Keres and Alekhine both played in four tournaments organized by [[Ehrhardt Post]], a President of Nazi ''Grossdeutscher Schachbund''. Alekhine won at the [[Salzburg 1942 chess tournament]] (Six Grandmasters' Tournament) in June 1942, at [[Munich]] ([[European Individual Chess Championship]]) in September 1942, and at [[Prague]] (International Tournament) in April 1943, always ahead of Keres, who placed second in all three of those tournaments. They tied for first at [[Salzburg]] (Six Grandmasters' Tournament) in June 1943, with 7\u00bd/10.\n\nDuring World War II, Keres played in several more chess tournaments. He won all 15 games at [[Tallinn]] 1942 (Estonian championship), and swept all five games at [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] 1943. He also won the Estonian title event held at Tallinn 1943, and [[Madrid]] 1944 (13/14, +12\u22120=2). He was second, behind [[Stig Lundholm]], at [[Lidk\u00f6ping]] 1944 (playing hors concours in the [[Swedish Chess Championship|Swedish Championship]]). Keres won a match with [[Folke Ekstr\u00f6m]] at [[Stockholm]] in 1944 by 5\u20131 (+4\u22120=2).<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/>\n\n==Dangerous circumstances==\nThe close of [[World War II]] placed Keres in dangerous circumstances. During the war, his native Estonia was successively occupied by the Soviet Union, Germany and again the Soviet Union. Estonia had been under Russian control when Keres was born in 1916, but it was an independent nation between the two world wars.\n\nDuring World War II, Keres participated in several tournaments in European regions under German occupation, including those Nazi-organized (1942 Tallinn, Salzburg, Munich, 1943 Prague, Posen, Salzburg, Reval), and when the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1944, he unsuccessfully attempted to escape to western Europe. His 1942 Nazi newspaper interview was used for anti-Soviet propaganda. As a consequence, he was suspected of collaboration with the Nazis and questioned by the Soviet authorities.<ref>Heuer, Valter, \u201cThe Troubled Years of Paul Keres, the Great Silent\nOne\u201d, New In Chess #4, 1995, Amsterdam, Holland; Jan Timman, editor.</ref> Keres managed to avoid deportation or any worse fate (e.g., that of [[Vladimirs Petrovs]]); however, he may have been held in detention; precise details are difficult to ascertain.<ref>''Paul Keres' Best Games Volume 1 \u2013 Closed Games'', by Egon Varnusz, Cadogan Chess, London 1994, introduction</ref>\n\nBut his return to the international chess scene was delayed, in spite of his excellent form; he won at Riga 1944/45 ([[Baltic Chess Championship|Baltic Championship]]) (10\u00bd/11). Presumably for political reasons, he was excluded from the ten-player Soviet team for the [[USA vs. USSR radio chess match 1945|1945 radio match against the U.S.A.]], and he did not participate in the first great post-war tournament at [[Groningen 1946 chess tournament|the 1946 Groningen tournament]] which was won by Botvinnik, just ahead of Euwe and [[Vasily Smyslov]].\n\nHe won the Estonian Championship at Tallinn 1945 with 13/15 (+11\u22120=4), ahead of several strong visiting Soviets, including [[Alexander Kotov]], [[Alexander Tolush]], Lilienthal, and Flohr. He then won at [[Tbilisi]] 1946 (hors concours in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Championship) with a near-perfect score of 18/19, ahead of [[Vladas Mik\u0117nas]] and a 16-year-old [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/>\n\nKeres returned to international play in 1946 in the Soviet radio match against Great Britain, and continued his excellent playing form that year and the next year. Even after he resumed a relatively normal life and chess career, however, his play at the highest level appears to have been affected by living under the occupation of the Soviet Union, which at a minimum must have aggravated the stress of playing under the watchful eye and tight control of the Soviet chess hierarchy.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==World Championship Candidate (1948\u20131965)==\nAlthough Keres participated in the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 World Championship tournament]], arranged to determine the world champion after Alekhine's death in 1946, his performance was far from his best. Held jointly in [[The Hague]] and Moscow, the tournament was limited to five participants: [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Vasily Smyslov]], Paul Keres, [[Samuel Reshevsky]], and [[Max Euwe]]. ([[Reuben Fine]] had also been invited but declined.) The event was played as a quintuple [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Keres finished joint third, with 10\u00bd out of 20 points. In his individual match with the winner, Botvinnik, he lost four of five games, winning only in the last round when the tournament's result was already determined.\n\nSince Keres lost his first four games against Botvinnik in the 1948 tournament, suspicions have sometimes been raised that Keres was forced to \"throw\" games to allow Botvinnik to win the championship. Chess historian Taylor Kingston investigated all the available evidence and arguments, and concluded that: Soviet chess officials gave Keres strong hints that he should not hinder Botvinnik's attempt to win the World Championship; Botvinnik only discovered this about halfway through the tournament and protested so strongly that he angered Soviet officials; Keres probably did not deliberately lose games to Botvinnik or anyone else in the tournament.<ref name=\"KingstonBotvinnikKeres\">Kingston wrote a two-part series: {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb1.txt\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence \u2013 Part I\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=1998\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} and {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb2.txt\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence \u2013 Part II\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=1998\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} Kingston published a further article, {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles165.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case Revisited: A Further Survey of the Evidence\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2001\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} after the publication of further evidence which he summarizes in his third article. In a subsequent two-part interview with Kingston, Soviet grandmaster and official [[Yuri Averbakh]] said that: Stalin would not have given orders that Keres should lose to Botvinnik; Smyslov would probably have been the candidate most preferred by officials; Keres was under severe psychological stress as a result of the multiple invasions of his home country, Estonia, and of his subsequent treatment by Soviet officials up to late 1946; and Keres was less tough mentally than his rivals \u2013 {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles181.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Yuri Averbakh: An Interview with History \u2013 Part 1\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2002\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} and {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles183.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Yuri Averbakh: An Interview with History \u2013 Part 2\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2002\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nKeres finished second or equal second in four straight Candidates' tournaments (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962), making him the player with the most runner-up finishes in that event. (He was therefore occasionally nicknamed \"Paul II\".) Keres participated in a total of six [[Candidates' Tournament]]s:<ref name=\"chessmetrics\" />\n* [[Budapest]] 1950, 4th, behind [[David Bronstein]] and [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], with 9\u00bd/18 (+3\u22122=13).\n* [[Z\u00fcrich]] 1953, tied 2nd\u20134th, along with [[David Bronstein]] and Reshevsky, two points behind Smyslov, with 16/28 (+8\u22124=16).\n* [[Amsterdam]] 1956, 2nd, 1\u00bd points behind Smyslov, with 10/18 (+3\u22121=14).\n* [[Yugoslavia]] 1959, 2nd, 1\u00bd points behind [[Mikhail Tal]], with 18\u00bd/28 (+15\u22126=7). He had positive or equal scores against all the competitors, including 3\u20131 against Tal, but this was not enough, since Tal scored 14\u00bd/16 against the bottom four finishers.\n* [[Cura\u00e7ao]] 1962, tied 2nd\u20133rd, with [[Efim Geller]], half a point behind [[Tigran Petrosian]], with 17/27 (+9\u22122=16). This event is discussed further at [[World Chess Championship 1963]]. Keres won a match at Moscow 1962 against Geller, for an exempt place in the 1965 Candidates, by 4\u00bd\u20133\u00bd (+2\u22121=5).\n* [[Riga]] 1965, lost his quarter-final match to eventual Candidates' winner [[Boris Spassky]] by 6\u20134 (+2\u22124=4). This was the only match loss of Keres' long career.\n\nKeres' run of four successive second places in Candidates' tournaments (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962) has prompted suspicions that he was under orders not to win these events. Taylor Kingston concludes that: there was probably no pressure from Soviet officials, since from 1954 onwards, Keres was rehabilitated and Botvinnik was no longer in favour with officials. At Cura\u00e7ao 1962, there was an ''unofficial'' conspiracy by Petrosian, Geller and Keres, and this worked out to Keres' disadvantage, since he may have been slightly stronger than both Petrosian and Geller at this stage.<ref name=\"KingstonKeresBotvinnik3\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles165.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case Revisited: A Further Survey of the Evidence\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2001\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\nBronstein, in his final book, published just after his death in late 2006, wrote that the Soviet chess leadership favoured Smyslov to win Zurich 1953, and pressured several of the other top Soviets to arrange this outcome, which did in fact occur. Bronstein wrote that Keres was ordered to draw his second cycle game with Smyslov, to conserve Smyslov's fading physical strength; Keres, who still had his own hopes of winning the event, tried as White to win an attacking game, but instead lost because of Smyslov's excellent play.<ref>''Secret Notes'', by David Bronstein and Sergey Voronkov, Edition Olms, Zurich 2007</ref>\n\n==Three-time Soviet champion, career peak==\nIn several other post-war events, however, Keres dominated the field. He won the exceptionally strong [[USSR Chess Championship]] three times. In 1947, he won at [[Leningrad]], URS-ch15, with 14/19 (+10\u22121=8); the field included every top Soviet player except Botvinnik. In 1950, he won at Moscow, URS-ch18, with 11\u00bd/17 (+8\u22122=7) against a field which was only slightly weaker than in 1947. Then in 1951, he triumphed again at Moscow, URS-ch19, with 12/17 (+9\u22122=6),<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/> against a super-class field which included [[Efim Geller]], Petrosian, Smyslov, Botvinnik, [[Yuri Averbakh]], [[David Bronstein]], [[Mark Taimanov]], [[Lev Aronin]], [[Salo Flohr]], [[Igor Bondarevsky]], and [[Alexander Kotov]].\n\nKeres won [[P\u00e4rnu]] 1947 with 9\u00bd/13 (+7\u22121=5), [[Szczawno-Zdr\u00f3j]] 1950 with 14\u00bd/19 (+11\u22121=7), and [[Budapest]] 1952 with 12\u00bd/17 (+10\u22122=5),<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/> the latter ahead of world champion Botvinnik and an all-star field which included Geller, Smyslov, [[Gideon St\u00e5hlberg]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (chess player)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szabo]], and Petrosian. The Budapest victory, which capped a stretch of four first-class wins over a two-year span, may represent the peak of his career. The Hungarian master and writer [[Egon Varnusz]], in his books on Keres, states that at this time, \"The best player in the world was Paul Keres\".<ref>''Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume I: Closed Games'', by [[Egon Varnusz]], Cadogan Chess, London 1987, p.xii</ref>\n\n==Unmatched International team successes==\nAfter being forced to become a Soviet citizen, Keres represented the Soviet Union in seven consecutive Olympiads, winning seven consecutive team gold medals, five board gold medals, and one bronze board medal. Of note was his appearance on {{chessgloss|first board|board one}} for the USSR in 1952, when the Soviets entered the event for the first time; Keres was the only Soviet team member with Olympiad experience (from his previous appearances for Estonia), and world champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not on the Soviet team. His four straight board gold medals from 1954\u20131960 is an Olympiad record. Although not selected after 1964, Keres served successfully as a team trainer with Soviet international teams for the next decade. Altogether, in 11 Olympiads, playing for both the USSR and Estonia (counting the unofficial [[3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad|Munich 1936]] event), and in 161 games, Keres accumulated a brilliant total of (+97\u221213=51), for 76.7%.

He tied 1st\u20132nd at [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] 1954\u201355 with Smyslov on 7/9 (+6\u22121=2). He dominated an internal Soviet training tournament at [[P\u00e4rnu]] 1955 with 9\u00bd/10. Keres placed 2nd at the 1955 [[Gothenburg]] [[Interzonal]], behind [[David Bronstein]], with 13\u00bd/20.

He has the seventh highest Chessmetrics 20-year average, from 1944 to 1963.\n\nHe was one of few players to have plus records against Capablanca, Euwe and Tal, and he also had equal records against Smyslov, Petrosian and [[Anatoly Karpov]]. In his long career, he played 10 world champions. He won at least one game against all from Capablanca to [[Bobby Fischer]] (his two games with Karpov were drawn), making him [[List of world records in chess#Most wins against world champions|one of only three players]] to beat nine undisputed world champions (the other two are [[Victor Korchnoi]] and [[Alexander Beliavsky]]). Other notable grandmasters against whom he had plus records include Fine, Flohr, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], [[Efim Geller]], [[Savielly Tartakower]], [[Mark Taimanov]], [[Milan Vidmar]], [[Svetozar Gligori\u0107]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Efim Bogoljubov]] and [[Bent Larsen]].\n\nHe wrote chess books that included a well-regarded, deeply annotated collection of his best games, ''Grandmaster of Chess'' {{ISBN|0-668-02645-6}}, ''The Art of the Middle Game'' (with [[Alexander Kotov]]) {{ISBN|0-486-26154-9}}, and ''Practical Chess Endings'' {{ISBN|0-7134-4210-7}}. All three books are still considered among the best of their kind for aspiring masters and experts. He also wrote several tournament books, including an account of the 1948 World Championship Match Tournament. He authored several openings treatises, often in German: ''Spanisch bis Franz\u00f6sisch'', ''Dreispringer bis Konigsgambit'' {{ISBN|4871875431}}, and ''Vierspringer bis Spanisch''. He contributed to the first volume, 'C', of the first edition of the Yugoslav-published ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'' (''ECO''), which appeared in 1974. Keres also co-founded the [[Riga]] magazine ''Shakhmaty''.\n\nKeres made many important contributions to opening theory. Perhaps best-known is the Keres Attack against the [[Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation|Scheveningen Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]] (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.g4), which was successfully introduced against [[Efim Bogolyubov]] at Salzburg 1943, and remains an important line. An original system on the Black side of the Closed [[Ruy Lopez]] (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Nd7) was introduced by Keres at the 1962 Candidates' tournament, and was popular for several years. He also popularized the [[Keres Defence]] (1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+) and a system on the Black side of the [[English Opening]] that runs 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 c6.\n\nKeres published 180 problems and 30 studies, including a rook ending that won a first prize in 1947.\"<ref>''Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume 1: Closed Games'', by Egon Varnusz, London, Cadogan 1987</ref>\n\nKeres won top-class tournaments from the mid-1930s into the mid-1970s, a span of 40 years, and won major events in [[western Europe]], [[eastern Europe]], the Soviet Union, South America, and North America. Botvinnik, by contrast, never competed in the Americas during his career.\n\nHis rival [[Samuel Reshevsky]] said that Keres failed to become world champion because he lacked a killer instinct and \"was too mild a person to give his all in order to defeat his opponents. He took everything, including his chess, philosophically. Keres is one of the nicest people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. With his friendly and sincere smile, he makes friends easily. He is goodnatured and kind. Yes, he loves chess, but being a human being is his first consideration. In addition to chess, Keres was interested in [[tennis]], [[Ping-Pong]], [[human swimming|swimming]], and bridge.\"<ref>''Great Chess Upsets'', by [[Samuel Reshevsky]], Arco Publishing, [[New York City|New York]] 1976, p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* {{Cite book\n |surname1=Keres|given1=Paul\n |surname2=Kotov|given2=Alexander\n |title=The Art of the Middle Game\n |year=1964\n |publisher=Penguin Books\n |postscript=<!--None-->}}\n* {{Cite book\n |surname1=Keres|given1=Paul\n |title=Practical Chess Endings\n |year=1973\n |publisher=R.H.M.

He was among the world's top players from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s.\n\nKeres narrowly missed a chance at a [[World Chess Championship|world championship]] match on five occasions. He won the 1938 [[AVRO 1938 chess tournament|AVRO tournament]], which led to negotiations for a title match against champion [[Alexander Alekhine]], but the match never took place due to [[World War II]]. After the war Keres was runner-up in the [[Candidates' Tournament]] on four consecutive occasions.\n\nDue to these and other strong results, many chess historians consider Keres one of the greatest players in history, and the strongest player never to become [[World Chess Champion|world champion]]. He was nicknamed \"Paul the Second\", \"The Eternal Second\" and \"The [[Crown Prince]] of Chess\".<ref>David Hooper, Ken Whyld, Kenneth Whyld, ''The Oxford Companion to Chess'', Oxford University Press 1992, page 198</ref> Keres, [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and [[Alexander Beliavsky]] defeated nine world champions\u2014more than anyone else in history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Paul Keres.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Keres c. 1938]]\nKeres was born in [[Narva]] (then under supremacy of [[Russian Empire]], now [[Estonia]]).\n\nKeres first learned about chess from his father and his older brother [[Harald Keres|Harald]] (afterwards a prominent [[physicist]], who later\ntold friendly jokes to his students: \"I am not Paul's brother; Paul is my brother.\"). With the scarcity of chess literature in his small town, he learned about [[chess notation]] from the [[chess puzzle]]s in the daily newspaper, and compiled a handwritten collection of almost 1000 games.<ref>Paul Keres, Grandmaster of Chess: The Complete Games of Paul Keres, ed. and trans. by Harry Golombek, Arco, New York, 1977.</ref> In his early days, he was known for a brilliant and sharp attacking style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zone.ee/pkeres/partiid.php |title=Paul Keres |publisher=Zone.ee |accessdate=2008-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224153204/http://www.zone.ee/pkeres/partiid.php |archivedate=February 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKeres was a three-time Estonian schoolboy champion, in 1930, 1932, and 1933. His playing matured after playing [[correspondence chess]] extensively while in high school. He probably played about 500 correspondence games, and at one stage had 150 correspondence games going simultaneously. In 1935, he won the [[Internationaler Fernschachbund]] (IFSB) international correspondence chess championship. From 1937 to 1941 he studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Tartu]], and competed in several interuniversity matches.<ref>''Grandmaster of Chess: The Complete Games of Paul Keres'', by Paul Keres, edited and translated by [[Harry Golombek]], Arco, New York, 1977</ref>\n\n==Pre-war years==\nKeres achieved a very good result at the age of 17 in a Master tournament at [[Tallinn]] 1933 with 5/7  (+5\u22122=0), tied 3rd\u20134th, half a point behind joint winners [[Paul Felix Schmidt]] and V. Kappe.<ref>rogerpaige.me.uk/tables4.htm</ref> Keres became [[Estonian Chess Championship|champion of Estonia]] for the first time in 1935. He tied for first (+5\u22122=1) with [[Gunnar Friedemann]] in the tournament, then defeated him (+2\u22121=0) in the playoff match. In April 1935, Keres defeated [[Feliks Kibbermann]], one of [[Tartu]]'s leading masters, in a training match, by (+3\u22121=0).<ref>''Grandmaster of Chess'', by Paul Keres, Arco 1972, pp 188\u201389</ref>\n\nKeres played on {{chessgloss|first board|top board}} for Estonia in the 6th [[Chess Olympiad]] at [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]] 1935, and was regarded as the new star, admired for his dashing style. His success there gave him the confidence to venture onto the international circuit.\n\nAt [[Helsinki]] 1935, he placed 2nd behind [[Paulino Frydman|Paulin Frydman]] with 6\u00bd/8 (+6\u22121=1). He won at [[Tallinn]] 1936 with 9/10 (+8\u22120=2). Keres' first major international success against top-level competition came at [[Bad Nauheim]] 1936, where he tied for first with [[Alexander Alekhine]] at 6\u00bd/9 (+4\u22120=5). He struggled at [[Dresden, Germany|Dresden]] 1936, placing only 8\u20139th with (+2\u22124=3), but wrote that he learned an important lesson from this setback. Keres recovered at [[Zandvoort]] 1936 with a shared 3rd\u20134th place (+5\u22123=3). He then defended his Estonian title in 1936 by drawing a challenge match against [[Paul Felix Schmidt]] with (+3\u22123=1).<ref name=\"chessmetrics\">http://www.chessmetrics.com, the Paul Keres results file</ref>\n\nKeres had a series of successes in 1937. He won in Tallinn with 7\u00bd/9 (+6\u22120=3), then shared 1st\u20132nd at [[Margate, England|Margate]] with [[Reuben Fine]] at 7\u00bd/9 (+6\u22120=3), 1\u00bd points ahead of Alekhine. In [[Ostend]], he tied 1st\u20133rd places with Fine and [[Henry Grob]] at 6/9 (+5\u22122=2). Keres dominated in [[Prague]] to claim first with 10/11 (+9\u22120=2). He then won a theme tournament in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] with 4\u00bd/6 (+4\u22121=1); the tournament saw all games commence with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 Ne4, known as the D\u00f6ry Defence. He tied for 4\u20135th places at [[Kemeri]] with 11\u00bd/17 (+8\u22122=7), as [[Salo Flohr]], [[Vladimirs Petrovs]] and [[Samuel Reshevsky]] won. Then he tied 2nd\u20134th in [[P\u00e4rnu]] with 4\u00bd/7 (+3\u22121=3).\n\nThis successful string earned him an invitation to the tournament at [[Semmering, Austria|Semmering]]\u2013[[Baden]] 1937, which he won with 9/14 (+6\u22122=6), ahead of Fine, [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], Reshevsky, and [[Erich Eliskases]]. Keres, in his autobiographical games collection, refers to this major event as a 'Candidates' Tournament', and claimed that he was recognized as a Grandmaster after winning it,<ref>''Grandmaster of Chess: The Complete Games of Paul Keres'', by Paul Keres, edited and translated by [[Harry Golombek]], New York, ARCO Publishing 1972</ref> although its parallel connection with later [[FIDE]]-organized Candidates' tournaments (from 1950 onwards) is not exact, and the Grandmaster title was not formalized by FIDE until 1950.\n\nKeres tied for second at [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] 1937\u201338 with 6\u00bd/9 (+4\u22120=5) (half a point behind Reshevsky), and at [[Noordwijk]] 1938 (behind Eliskases) with 6\u00bd/9 (+4\u22120=5). Keres drew an exhibition match at [[Stockholm]] 1938 with [[Gideon St\u00e5hlberg]] on 4\u20134 (+2\u22122=4).<ref name=\"chessmetrics\" />\n\nHe continued to represent Estonia with success in Olympiad play. His detailed results for Estonia follow. Of note was the team bronze medal attained by Estonia in 1939; this was exceptional for a country with a population of less than two million people.<ref>http://www.olimpbase.org/players/cq6agwkb.html (1935, 1937, 1939 results); ''Grandmaster of Chess'', by Paul Keres, translated by Harry Golombek, New York, ARCO Publishing 1972, p. 188 (1936 results)</ref>\n* [[6th Chess Olympiad|Warsaw 1935]], Estonia board 1, 12\u00bd/19 (+11\u22125=3);\n* [[3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad|Munich 1936]] (unofficial Olympiad), Estonia board 1, 15\u00bd/20 (+12\u22121=7), board gold medal;\n* [[7th Chess Olympiad|Stockholm 1937]], Estonia board 1, 11/15 (+9\u22122=4), board silver medal;\n* [[8th Chess Olympiad|Buenos Aires 1939]], Estonia board 1, 14\u00bd/19 (+12\u22122=5), team bronze medal.\n\n==World Championship match denied==\nIn 1938 he tied with Fine for first, with 8\u00bd/14, in the all-star [[AVRO tournament]], held in various cities in the Netherlands, ahead of chess legends [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Max Euwe]], Reshevsky, Alekhine, Capablanca and Flohr. AVRO was one of the strongest tournaments in history; some chess historians believe it the strongest ever staged. Keres won on tiebreak because he beat Fine 1\u00bd\u2013\u00bd in their individual two games.\n\nIt was expected that the winner of this tournament would be the challenger for the [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] title, in a match against World Champion [[Alexander Alekhine]], but the outbreak of the Second World War, especially because of the first occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940\u201341, brought negotiations with Alekhine to an end. Keres had begun his university studies in 1937, and this also played a role in the failed match.\n\nKeres struggled at [[Leningrad]]\u2013Moscow 1939 with a shared 12\u201313th place; he wrote that he had not had enough time to prepare for this very strong event, where he faced many Soviet stars for the first time. But he recovered with more preparation time, and won Margate 1939 with 7\u00bd/9 (+6\u22120=3), ahead of Capablanca and Flohr.<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/>\n\n==World War II==\nAt the outbreak of [[World War II]], Keres was in [[Buenos Aires]] for the Olympiad. He stayed on to play in a Buenos Aires international tournament after the Olympiad, and tied for first place with [[Miguel Najdorf]] with 8\u00bd/11 (+7\u22121=3).\n\nHis next event was a 14-game match with former World Champion [[Max Euwe]] in the Netherlands, held from December 1939 \u2013 January 1940. Keres won a hard-fought struggle by 7\u00bd\u20136\u00bd (+6\u22125=3). This was a superb achievement, because not only was Euwe a former World Champion, but he had enormous experience at match play, far more than Keres.\n\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] having been concluded on August 23, 1939, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union on August 6, 1940. Keres played in his first Soviet Championship at Moscow 1940 (URS-ch12), placing fourth (+9\u22124=6) in an exceptionally strong field, placing him ahead of the defending champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], among others. The [[Soviet Chess Federation]] organized the \"Absolute Championship of the USSR\" in 1941, with the top six finishers from the 1940 championship meeting each other four times; it was split between [[Leningrad]] and Moscow. Botvinnik won the event, one of the strongest ever organized, with 13\u00bd/20, and Keres placed second with 11, ahead of [[Vasily Smyslov]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Andor Lilienthal]], and [[Igor Bondarevsky]].\n\nWith the [[Nazi]] invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, Estonia came under German control soon afterwards. During 1942 and 1943, Keres and Alekhine both played in four tournaments organized by [[Ehrhardt Post]], a President of Nazi ''Grossdeutscher Schachbund''. Alekhine won at the [[Salzburg 1942 chess tournament]] (Six Grandmasters' Tournament) in June 1942, at [[Munich]] ([[European Individual Chess Championship]]) in September 1942, and at [[Prague]] (International Tournament) in April 1943, always ahead of Keres, who placed second in all three of those tournaments. They tied for first at [[Salzburg]] (Six Grandmasters' Tournament) in June 1943, with 7\u00bd/10.\n\nDuring World War II, Keres played in several more chess tournaments. He won all 15 games at [[Tallinn]] 1942 (Estonian championship), and swept all five games at [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] 1943. He also won the Estonian title event held at Tallinn 1943, and [[Madrid]] 1944 (13/14, +12\u22120=2). He was second, behind [[Stig Lundholm]], at [[Lidk\u00f6ping]] 1944 (playing hors concours in the [[Swedish Chess Championship|Swedish Championship]]). Keres won a match with [[Folke Ekstr\u00f6m]] at [[Stockholm]] in 1944 by 5\u20131 (+4\u22120=2).<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/>\n\n==Dangerous circumstances==\nThe close of [[World War II]] placed Keres in dangerous circumstances. During the war, his native Estonia was successively occupied by the Soviet Union, Germany and again the Soviet Union. Estonia had been under Russian control when Keres was born in 1916, but it was an independent nation between the two world wars.\n\nDuring World War II, Keres participated in several tournaments in European regions under German occupation, including those Nazi-organized (1942 Tallinn, Salzburg, Munich, 1943 Prague, Posen, Salzburg, Reval), and when the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1944, he unsuccessfully attempted to escape to western Europe. His 1942 Nazi newspaper interview was used for anti-Soviet propaganda. As a consequence, he was suspected of collaboration with the Nazis and questioned by the Soviet authorities.<ref>Heuer, Valter, \u201cThe Troubled Years of Paul Keres, the Great Silent\nOne\u201d, New In Chess #4, 1995, Amsterdam, Holland; Jan Timman, editor.</ref> Keres managed to avoid deportation or any worse fate (e.g., that of [[Vladimirs Petrovs]]); however, he may have been held in detention; precise details are difficult to ascertain.<ref>''Paul Keres' Best Games Volume 1 \u2013 Closed Games'', by Egon Varnusz, Cadogan Chess, London 1994, introduction</ref>\n\nBut his return to the international chess scene was delayed, in spite of his excellent form; he won at Riga 1944/45 ([[Baltic Chess Championship|Baltic Championship]]) (10\u00bd/11). Presumably for political reasons, he was excluded from the ten-player Soviet team for the [[USA vs. USSR radio chess match 1945|1945 radio match against the U.S.A.]], and he did not participate in the first great post-war tournament at [[Groningen 1946 chess tournament|the 1946 Groningen tournament]] which was won by Botvinnik, just ahead of Euwe and [[Vasily Smyslov]].\n\nHe won the Estonian Championship at Tallinn 1945 with 13/15 (+11\u22120=4), ahead of several strong visiting Soviets, including [[Alexander Kotov]], [[Alexander Tolush]], Lilienthal, and Flohr. He then won at [[Tbilisi]] 1946 (hors concours in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Championship) with a near-perfect score of 18/19, ahead of [[Vladas Mik\u0117nas]] and a 16-year-old [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/>\n\nKeres returned to international play in 1946 in the Soviet radio match against Great Britain, and continued his excellent playing form that year and the next year. Even after he resumed a relatively normal life and chess career, however, his play at the highest level appears to have been affected by living under the occupation of the Soviet Union, which at a minimum must have aggravated the stress of playing under the watchful eye and tight control of the Soviet chess hierarchy.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==World Championship Candidate (1948\u20131965)==\nAlthough Keres participated in the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 World Championship tournament]], arranged to determine the world champion after Alekhine's death in 1946, his performance was far from his best. Held jointly in [[The Hague]] and Moscow, the tournament was limited to five participants: [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Vasily Smyslov]], Paul Keres, [[Samuel Reshevsky]], and [[Max Euwe]]. ([[Reuben Fine]] had also been invited but declined.) The event was played as a quintuple [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Keres finished joint third, with 10\u00bd out of 20 points. In his individual match with the winner, Botvinnik, he lost four of five games, winning only in the last round when the tournament's result was already determined.\n\nSince Keres lost his first four games against Botvinnik in the 1948 tournament, suspicions have sometimes been raised that Keres was forced to \"throw\" games to allow Botvinnik to win the championship. Chess historian Taylor Kingston investigated all the available evidence and arguments, and concluded that: Soviet chess officials gave Keres strong hints that he should not hinder Botvinnik's attempt to win the World Championship; Botvinnik only discovered this about halfway though the tournament and protested so strongly that he angered Soviet officials; Keres probably did not deliberately lose games to Botvinnik or anyone else in the tournament.<ref name=\"KingstonBotvinnikKeres\">Kingston wrote a two-part series: {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb1.txt\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence \u2013 Part I\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=1998\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} and {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb2.txt\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence \u2013 Part II\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=1998\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} Kingston published a further article, {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles165.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case Revisited: A Further Survey of the Evidence\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2001\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} after the publication of further evidence which he summarizes in his third article. In a subsequent two-part interview with Kingston, Soviet grandmaster and official [[Yuri Averbakh]] said that: Stalin would not have given orders that Keres should lose to Botvinnik; Smyslov would probably have been the candidate most preferred by officials; Keres was under severe psychological stress as a result of the multiple invasions of his home country, Estonia, and of his subsequent treatment by Soviet officials up to late 1946; and Keres was less tough mentally than his rivals \u2013 {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles181.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Yuri Averbakh: An Interview with History \u2013 Part 1\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2002\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} and {{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles183.pdf\n |format=PDF| title=Yuri Averbakh: An Interview with History \u2013 Part 2\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2002\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nKeres finished second or equal second in four straight Candidates' tournaments (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962), making him the player with the most runner-up finishes in that event. (He was therefore occasionally nicknamed \"Paul II\".) Keres participated in a total of six [[Candidates' Tournament]]s:<ref name=\"chessmetrics\" />\n* [[Budapest]] 1950, 4th, behind [[David Bronstein]] and [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], with 9\u00bd/18 (+3\u22122=13).\n* [[Z\u00fcrich]] 1953, tied 2nd\u20134th, along with [[David Bronstein]] and Reshevsky, two points behind Smyslov, with 16/28 (+8\u22124=16).\n* [[Amsterdam]] 1956, 2nd, 1\u00bd points behind Smyslov, with 10/18 (+3\u22121=14).\n* [[Yugoslavia]] 1959, 2nd, 1\u00bd points behind [[Mikhail Tal]], with 18\u00bd/28 (+15\u22126=7). He had positive or equal scores against all the competitors, including 3\u20131 against Tal, but this was not enough, since Tal scored 14\u00bd/16 against the bottom four finishers.\n* [[Cura\u00e7ao]] 1962, tied 2nd\u20133rd, with [[Efim Geller]], half a point behind [[Tigran Petrosian]], with 17/27 (+9\u22122=16). This event is discussed further at [[World Chess Championship 1963]]. Keres won a match at Moscow 1962 against Geller, for an exempt place in the 1965 Candidates, by 4\u00bd\u20133\u00bd (+2\u22121=5).\n* [[Riga]] 1965, lost his quarter-final match to eventual Candidates' winner [[Boris Spassky]] by 6\u20134 (+2\u22124=4). This was the only match loss of Keres' long career.\n\nKeres' run of four successive second places in Candidates' tournaments (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962) has prompted suspicions that he was under orders not to win these events. Taylor Kingston concludes that: there was probably no pressure from Soviet officials, since from 1954 onwards, Keres was rehabilitated and Botvinnik was no longer in favour with officials. At Cura\u00e7ao 1962, there was an ''unofficial'' conspiracy by Petrosian, Geller and Keres, and this worked out to Keres' disadvantage, since he may have been slightly stronger than both Petrosian and Geller at this stage.<ref name=\"KingstonKeresBotvinnik3\">{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles165.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case Revisited: A Further Survey of the Evidence\n | author=Kingston, T.\n | year=2001\n | publisher=The Chess Cafe\n}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\nBronstein, in his final book, published just after his death in late 2006, wrote that the Soviet chess leadership favoured Smyslov to win Zurich 1953, and pressured several of the other top Soviets to arrange this outcome, which did in fact occur. Bronstein wrote that Keres was ordered to draw his second cycle game with Smyslov, to conserve Smyslov's fading physical strength; Keres, who still had his own hopes of winning the event, tried as White to win an attacking game, but instead lost because of Smyslov's excellent play.<ref>''Secret Notes'', by David Bronstein and Sergey Voronkov, Edition Olms, Zurich 2007</ref>\n\n==Three-time Soviet champion, career peak==\nIn several other post-war events, however, Keres dominated the field. He won the exceptionally strong [[USSR Chess Championship]] three times. In 1947, he won at [[Leningrad]], URS-ch15, with 14/19 (+10\u22121=8); the field included every top Soviet player except Botvinnik. In 1950, he won at Moscow, URS-ch18, with 11\u00bd/17 (+8\u22122=7) against a field which was only slightly weaker than in 1947. Then in 1951, he triumphed again at Moscow, URS-ch19, with 12/17 (+9\u22122=6),<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/> against a super-class field which included [[Efim Geller]], Petrosian, Smyslov, Botvinnik, [[Yuri Averbakh]], [[David Bronstein]], [[Mark Taimanov]], [[Lev Aronin]], [[Salo Flohr]], [[Igor Bondarevsky]], and [[Alexander Kotov]].\n\nKeres won [[P\u00e4rnu]] 1947 with 9\u00bd/13 (+7\u22121=5), [[Szczawno-Zdr\u00f3j]] 1950 with 14\u00bd/19 (+11\u22121=7), and [[Budapest]] 1952 with 12\u00bd/17 (+10\u22122=5),<ref name=\"chessmetrics\"/> the latter ahead of world champion Botvinnik and an all-star field which included Geller, Smyslov, [[Gideon St\u00e5hlberg]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (chess player)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szabo]], and Petrosian. The Budapest victory, which capped a stretch of four first-class wins over a two-year span, may represent the peak of his career. The Hungarian master and writer [[Egon Varnusz]], in his books on Keres, states that at this time, \"The best player in the world was Paul Keres\".<ref>''Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume I: Closed Games'', by [[Egon Varnusz]], Cadogan Chess, London 1987, p.xii</ref>\n\n==Unmatched International team successes==\nAfter being forced to become a Soviet citizen, Keres represented the Soviet Union in seven consecutive Olympiads, winning seven consecutive team gold medals, five board gold medals, and one bronze board medal. Of note was his appearance on {{chessgloss|first board|board one}} for the USSR in 1952, when the Soviets entered the event for the first time; Keres was the only Soviet team member with Olympiad experience (from his previous appearances for Estonia), and world champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not on the Soviet team. His four straight board gold medals from 1954\u20131960 is an Olympiad record. Although not selected after 1964, Keres served successfully as a team trainer with Soviet international teams for the next decade. Altogether, in 11 Olympiads, playing for both the USSR and Estonia (counting the unofficial [[3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad|Munich 1936]] event), and in 161 games, Keres accumulated a brilliant total of (+97\u221213=51), for 76.7%.

He won [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] 1957\u201358 (7\u00bd/9, ahead of [[Svetozar Gligori\u0107]]). He was tied 3rd\u20134th at [[Z\u00fcrich]] 1959, at 10\u00bd/15, along with [[Bobby Fischer]], behind Tal and Gligori\u0107. He placed tied 7\u20138th in the USSR Championship, [[Tbilisi]] 1959 (URS-ch26) with 10\u00bd/19, as Petrosian won. Keres was third at [[Stockholm]] 1959\u201360 with 7/9. He won at [[P\u00e4rnu]] 1960 with 12/15. He was the champion at [[Z\u00fcrich]] 1961 (9/11, ahead of Petrosian).

The World Chess Federation named 2016 as \"the Year of Paul Keres\".<ref>[http://www.rexfeatures.com/livefeed/2016/01/07/statue_of_estonian_chess_player_paul_keres,_narva rexfeatures.com] Retrieved 20 February 2016.</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=nolines widths=\"220px\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Narva Statue Paul Keres.jpg|Statue in honour of Paul Keres in Narva\n\nFile:EEK-5krooni-front.jpg|The former Estonian [[5 krooni]] banknote with a portrait of Keres\nFile:1991 CPA 6284.jpg|[[USSR]] [[Postage stamp|stamp]] devoted to Keres, 1991 (Michel 6163, Scott 5964)\n</gallery>\n\n==Legacy and writings==\n{{AN chess|pos=secright}}\nThe unofficial [[Chessmetrics]] system places Keres in the top 10 players in the world between approximately 1936 and 1965, and overall he had one of the highest winning percentages of all grandmasters in history. He has the seventh highest Chessmetrics 20-year average, from 1944 to 1963.\n\nHe was one of few players to have plus records against Capablanca, Euwe and Tal, and he also had equal records against Smyslov, Petrosian and [[Anatoly Karpov]]. In his long career, he played 10 world champions. He won at least one game against all from Capablanca to [[Bobby Fischer]] (his two games with Karpov were drawn), making him [[List of world records in chess#Most wins against world champions|one of only three players]] to beat nine undisputed world champions (the other two are [[Victor Korchnoi]] and [[Alexander Beliavsky]]). Other notable grandmasters against whom he had plus records include Fine, Flohr, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], [[Efim Geller]], [[Savielly Tartakower]], [[Mark Taimanov]], [[Milan Vidmar]], [[Svetozar Gligori\u0107]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Efim Bogoljubov]] and [[Bent Larsen]].\n\nHe wrote chess books that included a well-regarded, deeply annotated collection of his best games, ''Grandmaster of Chess'' {{ISBN|0-668-02645-6}}, ''The Art of the Middle Game'' (with [[Alexander Kotov]]) {{ISBN|0-486-26154-9}}, and ''Practical Chess Endings'' {{ISBN|0-7134-4210-7}}. All three books are still considered among the best of their kind for aspiring masters and experts. He also wrote several tournament books, including an account of the 1948 World Championship Match Tournament. He authored several openings treatises, often in German: ''Spanisch bis Franz\u00f6sisch'', ''Dreispringer bis Konigsgambit'' {{ISBN|4871875431}}, and ''Vierspringer bis Spanisch''. He contributed to the first volume, 'C', of the first edition of the Yugoslav-published ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]'' (''ECO''), which appeared in 1974. Keres also co-founded the [[Riga]] magazine ''Shakhmaty''.\n\nKeres made many important contributions to opening theory. Perhaps best-known is the Keres Attack against the [[Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation|Scheveningen Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]] (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.g4), which was successfully introduced against [[Efim Bogolyubov]] at Salzburg 1943, and remains an important line. An original system on the Black side of the Closed [[Ruy Lopez]] (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Na5 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Nd7) was introduced by Keres at the 1962 Candidates' tournament, and was popular for several years. He also popularized the [[Keres Defence]] (1.d4 e6 2.c4 Bb4+) and a system on the Black side of the [[English Opening]] that runs 1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 c6.\n\nKeres published 180 problems and 30 studies, including a rook ending that won a first prize in 1947.\"<ref>''Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume 1: Closed Games'', by Egon Varnusz, London, Cadogan 1987</ref>\n\nKeres won top-class tournaments from the mid-1930s into the mid-1970s, a span of 40 years, and won major events in [[western Europe]], [[eastern Europe]], the Soviet Union, South America, and North America. Botvinnik, by contrast, never competed in the Americas during his career.\n\nHis rival [[Samuel Reshevsky]] said that Keres failed to become world champion because he lacked a killer instinct and \"was too mild a person to give his all in order to defeat his opponents. He took everything, including his chess, philosophically. Keres is one of the nicest people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. With his friendly and sincere smile, he makes friends easily. He is goodnatured and kind. Yes, he loves chess, but being a human being is his first consideration. In addition to chess, Keres was interested in [[tennis]], [[Ping-Pong]], [[human swimming|swimming]], and bridge.\"<ref>''Great Chess Upsets'', by [[Samuel Reshevsky]], Arco Publishing, [[New York City|New York]] 1976, p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* {{Cite book\n |surname1=Keres|given1=Paul\n |surname2=Kotov|given2=Alexander\n |title=The Art of the Middle Game\n |year=1964\n |publisher=Penguin Books\n |postscript=<!--None-->}}\n* {{Cite book\n |surname1=Keres|given1=Paul\n |title=Practical Chess Endings\n |year=1973\n |publisher=R.H.M.

The Ha\u00e7ienda is associated with the rise of [[acid house]] and [[rave]] music.\n\n== Creation ==\n[[File:Hacienda-300.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Ha\u00e7ienda's exterior on the corner of Whitworth St. West and Albion St.]]\nThe former warehouse occupied by the club was at 11-13, [[Whitworth Street|Whitworth Street West]] on the south side of the [[Rochdale Canal]]: the frontage was curved and built of red [[Accrington brick]]. Before it was turned into a club, The Ha\u00e7ienda was a yacht builder's shop and warehouse.\n\nOriginally conceived by [[Rob Gretton]], it was largely financed by the record label [[Factory Records]] and the band [[New Order (band)|New Order]] along with label boss [[Tony Wilson]]. It was on the corner of Whitworth Street West and Albion Street, close to [[Castlefield]], in the centre of the city. FAC 51 was its official designation in the Factory catalogue. New Order and Tony Wilson were directors of the club.\n\nDesigned by [[Ben Kelly (designer)|Ben Kelly]], upon recommendation by Factory graphic designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], upstairs consisted of a stage, dance area, bar, cloakroom, cafeteria area and balcony with a DJ booth. Downstairs was a cocktail bar called The Gay Traitor, which referred to [[Anthony Blunt]], a British art historian who spied for the [[Soviet Union]]. The two other bars, The [[Kim Philby]] and [[Guy Burgess|Hicks]], were named after Blunt's fellow spies. From 1995 onwards, the lower cellar areas of the venue were converted to create the 5th Man, a smaller music venue.\n\nThe Sound & Lighting design & installation for the Hacienda was done by Eddie Akka from Akwil Ltd.\n\n===Name===\nThe name comes from a slogan of the radical group [[Situationist International]]: \"The Hacienda Must Be Built\", from ''Formulary for a New Urbanism'' by [[Ivan Chtcheglov]].<ref name=\"BBCManc\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/05/17/210507_hacienda_facts_feature.shtml 25 Year Party Palace].

[[The Smiths]] performed there three times in 1983. It served as a venue for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on her first performance in the United Kingdom, on 27 January 1984.

As well as club nights there were regular concerts, including one in which [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] drilled into the walls that surrounded the stage.<ref name=\"BBCManc\" />\n\nIn 1986, it became one of the first British clubs to start playing [[house music]], with DJs Hewan Clarke,[[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]] and later  [[Mike Pickering]] (of [[Quando Quango]] and [[M People]]) and Little Martin (later with [[Graeme Park (DJ)|Graeme Park]]) hosting the visionary \"Nude\" night on Fridays. This night quickly became legendary, and helped to turn around the reputation and fortunes of The Ha\u00e7ienda, which went from making a consistent loss to being full every night of the week by early 1987.\n\n===Acid house and rave===\nThe growth of the '[[Madchester]]' scene had little to do with the healthy [[house music]] scene in Manchester at the time but it was boosted by the success of The Ha\u00e7ienda's pioneering [[Ibiza]] night, \"Hot\", an [[acid house]] night hosted by Pickering and [[Jon DaSilva]] in July 1988.\n\nHowever, drug use became a problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-33675090|first=Rachael|last=Connors|date=27 July 2015|accessdate=27 July 2015|title=Paul Massey death: Who was Salford's Mr Big?|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> On 14 July 1989, the UK's first [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-related death occurred at the club; 16-year-old Clare Leighton collapsed and died after her boyfriend gave her an ecstasy tablet.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collin|first=Matthew|title=Altered state: the story of ecstasy culture and Acid House|year=1998|publisher=Serpent's Tail|isbn=978-1-85242-604-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/alteredstatestor00coll/page/160 160]|edition=2nd|author2=Godfrey, John|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/alteredstatestor00coll/page/160}}</ref> The police clampdown that followed was opposed by [[Manchester City Council]], which argued that the club contributed to an \"active use of the city centre core\" in line with the government's policy of regenerating urban areas.<ref name=ed/> The resulting problems caused the club to close for a short period in early 1991, before reopening with increased security later the same year.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1005752.stm Harking back to the Ha\u00e7ienda]. [[BBC News]]. 6 November 2000.</ref>\n\nHa\u00e7ienda DJs made regular and guest appearances on radio and TV shows like [[ITV Granada|Granada TV]]'s ''Juice'', [[Sunset 102]] and [[BBC Radio 1]]. Between 1994 and 1997 ''Hacienda FM'' was a weekly show on Manchester dance station [[Kiss 102]].\n\nSecurity was frequently a problem, particularly in the club's latter years. There were several shootings inside and outside the club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault on a man in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind with what looked like a metal bar before being pushed into the path of an on-coming car.<ref name=\"mixmag\">[http://www.techno.de/mixmag/98.02/Gangchester/Gangchester.3.html \"Gangchester\"], ''[[Mixmag]]'', February 1998</ref>\n\nAlthough security failures at the club were one of the contributing factors to the club eventually closing, the most likely cause was its finances.

Before it was turned into a club, The Ha\u00e7ienda was a yacht builder's shop and warehouse.\n\nOriginally conceived by [[Rob Gretton]], it was largely financed by the record label [[Factory Records]] and the band [[New Order (band)|New Order]] along with label boss [[Tony Wilson]]. It was on the corner of Whitworth Street West and Albion Street, close to [[Castlefield]], in the centre of the city. FAC 51 was its official designation in the Factory catalogue. New Order and Tony Wilson were directors of the club.\n\nDesigned by [[Ben Kelly (designer)|Ben Kelly]], upon recommendation by Factory graphic designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], upstairs consisted of a stage, dance area, bar, cloakroom, cafeteria area and balcony with a DJ booth. Downstairs was a cocktail bar called The Gay Traitor, which referred to [[Anthony Blunt]], a British art historian who spied for the [[Soviet Union]]. The two other bars, The [[Kim Philby]] and [[Guy Burgess|Hicks]], were named after Blunt's fellow spies. From 1995 onwards, the lower cellar areas of the venue were converted to create the 5th Man, a smaller music venue.\n\nThe Sound & Lighting design & installation for the Hacienda was done by Eddie Akka from Akwil Ltd.\n\n===Name===\nThe name comes from a slogan of the radical group [[Situationist International]]: \"The Hacienda Must Be Built\", from ''Formulary for a New Urbanism'' by [[Ivan Chtcheglov]].<ref name=\"BBCManc\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/05/17/210507_hacienda_facts_feature.shtml 25 Year Party Palace].

There were several shootings inside and outside the club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault on a man in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind with what looked like a metal bar before being pushed into the path of an on-coming car.<ref name=\"mixmag\">[http://www.techno.de/mixmag/98.02/Gangchester/Gangchester.3.html \"Gangchester\"], ''[[Mixmag]]'', February 1998</ref>\n\nAlthough security failures at the club were one of the contributing factors to the club eventually closing, the most likely cause was its finances.

[[Rob Gretton]] bequeathed his collection of Ha\u00e7ienda memorabilia to the museum.\n\nIn October 2009, Peter Hook published his book on his time as co-owner of The Ha\u00e7ienda, ''How Not to Run a Club''.\nIn 2010, Peter Hook had six [[bass guitar]]s made using wood from The Ha\u00e7ienda's dancefloor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cerysmaticfactory.info/fac51_the_hacienda_bass_guitar.html|title=FAC 51 The Hacienda Limited Edition Peter Hook Bass Guitar|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225092323/http://cerysmaticfactory.info/fac51_the_hacienda_bass_guitar.html|archivedate=25 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/peter-hooks-gig-with-bass-guitar-902292 |title=Peter Hook's gig with bass guitar made from Hacienda floor |author=Ben Turner |work=manchestereveningnews |date= 12 Jan 2013 }}</ref> The fret boards have been made from dancefloor planks, so they have \"[[Stiletto heel|stiletto]] marks and cigarette burns\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/news/10482513.Altrincham_shop_lands_rare_guitar/?ref=rss |title=Altrincham shop lands rare guitar |author=Rick Bowen |work=messengernewspapers.co.uk |date= 13 Jun 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*{{Commons category-inline}}\n*[[List of electronic dance music venues]]\n*[[Superclub]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book | title=The Ha\u00e7ienda Must Be Built | author=Savage , J. | publisher=[[International Music Publications]] | year=1992 | isbn=0-86359-857-9 | authorlink=Jon Savage }}\n* {{cite book | title=24 Hour Party People | author=Wilson, Tony | publisher=[[Pan MacMillan]] | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-7522-2025-3 | authorlink=Tony Wilson }}\n* {{cite book | title=The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club | author=Hook, Peter | publisher=[[Simon & Schuster Ltd]] | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-84737-135-5 | authorlink=Peter Hook }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Discogs label|The Hacienda}}\n*[http://www.PrideOfManchester.com/music/hacienda.htm Pride Of Manchester Ha\u00e7ienda memories by Ha\u00e7ienda DJ Dave Haslam]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180731112945/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/Scene/orgs/hacienda.htm Ha\u00e7ienda Profile] - Profile on the club & more on rave\n*[http://benkellydesign.com/hospitality/hacienda/ Ben Kelly Design - gallery of interior photos of The Ha\u00e7ienda]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509093106/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/images/920914%20CT%20Hacienda%20Flyer%201.jpg Fantazia.org.uk] - Fantazia/Ha\u00e7ienda flyer from 1992\n*[http://www.manchester.com/music/features/hacienda.php The Ha\u00e7ienda Story]\n*[https://blog.gregwilson.co.uk/2012/02/the-hacienda-dj-booth/comment-page-1/ The first Hacienda DJ Booth] \n*[https://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/the-hacienda-dj-booth/ Hacienda DJ Booth Story]\n\n{{Manchester B&S}}\n{{Factory Records}}\n{{New Order}}\n{{coord|53|28|27.55|N|02|14|51.66|W|type:landmark_region:GB-MAN|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hacienda}}\n[[Category:Nightclubs in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Defunct nightclubs in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England]]\n[[Category:History of Manchester]]\n[[Category:Madchester]]\n[[Category:Music in Manchester]]\n[[Category:Electronic dance music venues]]\n[[Category:Factory Records]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 1982]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1997 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Warehouses in England]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGregory Wilson(link changed toGreg Wilson (DJ)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ha%C3%A7ienda"}
