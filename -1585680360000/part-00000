In 1985, the book was renamed ''Legends & Lore'' due to concerns about bad publicity. The Babylonian, Finnish, nonhuman, and Sumerian content were removed to allow room for expansion of the remaining mythoi.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDDefinitiveFAQ.asp\n | title=Dungeons & Dragons FAQ\n | publisher=Wizards of the Coast\n | accessdate=2008-11-23\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' was published as a sourcebook for the second edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. This work re-introduced detailed information on the deities of several non-human pantheons.<ref name=FAQ /> The [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faer\u00fbnian pantheon]] for the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting was more fully detailed in 1996\u20131998 with the publication of ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', ''Powers & Pantheons'' and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]''.<ref name=FAQ />\n\n===Categories===\nThe deities are grouped into three categories:\n# Core powers \u2013 Deities presented in the ''Player's Handbook 3.5th edition'' or substantially introduced in the other two core books (''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''). Most of these deities are worshipped by [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]]. There is a subset within this category called '''Additional Deities''' which has deities not mentioned in the core rulebooks but instead in supplements and as such considered additions to the core category.\n# Alternate human pantheons \u2013 This lists the pantheons and the deities within them that are presented in the supplement book ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. Most are based upon real-life mythology.\n# Non-deity powers \u2013 These beings would fit into the previous category, but are not actually deities, plus most of them aren't the patron of a specific monstrous race. This includes the demon princes and archdevils as well as some other godlike beings.\n\nBefore third edition, there was no Core Setting, so the distinctions above are not as clear-cut. For the most part, materials which did not specify a setting were assumed to be at least compatible with the World of Greyhawk if not outright parts of the canon. As such, those prior materials are covered in the setting-specific lists of deities.\n\nThe book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', however, was considered to be canon for core materials for the gods of non-human races in second edition.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Ranks of Divine Power===\nFor game purposes, each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:\n*Quasi-deities or hero deities. Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers.\n*Demigods. They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.\n*Lesser deities. These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.\n*Intermediate deities. These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.\n*Greater deities. These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.\n*Overdeities. These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.\n\n===Portfolios===\nEvery deity has certain aspects of existence over which it has dominion, power, and control. Collectively, these aspects represent a deity's portfolio.\n\n===Domains===\nEach deity that can grant spells has multiple domains that give clerics access to extra spells and abilities from that domain. Which domains are associated with a deity is largely a function of the deity's portfolio.\n\n===Divine hierarchy===\nMany deities are arranged in pantheons, which are often led by Greater deities which are their direct superiors. The individual deities in a pantheon may not be forced to obey their superiors, although they typically respect and fear the superior deity.\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons''==\n''[[Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes]]'' (1976) included the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[mythology|mythologies]], as well as [[Robert E.

They selected and altered deities to correspond to \"iconic\" aspects of core D&D. Most core deities are human deities; except for the chief gods of the demihuman races. Certain aspects of the deities were altered to make them more generic \u2013 for example: the \"Core\" Heironeous favors the longsword (in order to make the favored weapon of the \"God of Chivalry\" more traditionally knight-like), as contrasted with the original \"Greyhawk\" Heironeous, who favors the battleaxe.\n\nThe designation of \"greater\" vs. \"intermediate\" comes from ''Legends & Lore'' (1990). It is not used in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|any edition of]] the ''Player's Handbook'', but it is used in ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' (2002) and various v3.5 [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Edition]] materials.\n\n===''Core'' D&D-pantheons===\n====Greater deities====\n*Boccob, god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight.<ref name=\"PHB35\">{{cite book |authorlink=Jonathan Tweet|last=Tweet |first=Jonathan |authorlink2=Monte Cook|last2=Cook|first2=Monte |authorlink3=Skip Williams|last3=Williams|first3=Skip |title=Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook I v.3.5 |year=2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2886-7}}</ref>{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\">{{cite book |authorlink=Rich Redman|last=Redman |first=Rich |authorlink2=Skip Williams|last2=Williams|first2=Skip |authorlink3=James Wyatt (game designer)|last3=Wyatt|first3=James |title=[[Deities and Demigods]] |year=2002 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2654-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n*[[Corellon Larethian]], god of [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], magic, music, and arts (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|62}}<ref name=\"Wild\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Skip |title=Races of the Wild |year=2005 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3438-7}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n*Garl Glittergold, god of [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]], humor, and gemcutting (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|69}}<ref name=\"Stone\">{{cite book |authorlink=David Noonan (game designer)|last=Noonan |first=David |authorlink2=Jesse Decker|last2=Decker|first2=Jesse |authorlink3=Michelle Lyons|last3=Lyons|first3=Michelle |title=[[Races of Stone]] |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3278-3}}</ref>{{rp|43}}<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=David |title=Complete Divine |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3272-4}}</ref>{{rp|109,112}}\n*[[Gruumsh]], god of orcs (also a monster power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|71}}\n*[[Moradin]], god of [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]] (also a demihuman power)<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"Stone\" />{{rp|17}}\n*[[Nerull]], god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld.<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,108}}<ref name=\"LibrisMortis\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer)|first2=Bruce R.|last2=Cordell|authorlink2=Bruce R.

Being monotheistic, it of course consists of only one deity (though said deity is described as having two aspects; a creator one and a destroyer one):\n\n*Taiia, greater goddess of creation, destruction, mortal life and death.\n\n====Following the Light====\nFollowing the Light is a fictional [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] religion presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for dualistic religions in 3rd Edition Deities and Demigods. Being dualistic, it consists of two, polar-opposite deities:\n\n*Elishar, intermediate deity of positive energy, light and prophecy.\n*Toldoth, intermediate deity of negative energy, darkness and destruction.\n\n====Dennari====\nThe faith of Dennari is a fictional [[mystery cult]], presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for mystery cults in 3rd Edition ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. It worships a single deity of the same name:\n\n*Dennari, lesser goddess of earth, liberation and suffering.\n\n=== Nondeity powers ===\nSimilar to monster powers, these are not true deities but very powerful extraplanar beings. These however do not even profess to be gods (though many still have designs on godhood).\n\n====Fiendish entities====\n===== Demon lords of the Abyss =====\nThe single unifying feature of all [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon lords]] (also called demon princes) is the inherent control over part of the infinite layers of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]]. Only the first 666 layers of The Abyss are generally known, and of those only a small fraction of the princes of those layers are a part of the D&D cosmology.\n*[[Baphomet (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baphomet, Prince of Beasts]], demon prince of beasts and vengeance (also the monster power of [[Minotaur (Dungeons & Dragons)|minotaurs]])<ref name=\"CodexI\">{{cite book |authorlink=Ed Stark|last=Stark |first=Ed |authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|last2=Jacobs|first2=James |authorlink3=Erik Mona|last3=Mona|first3=Erik |title=[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]] |year=2006 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3919-2}}</ref>{{rp|58}}\n*[[Dagon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dagon]], demon prince and patron of the deep sea.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|59}}\n*[[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], self-proclaimed \"Prince of Demons\".<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|61}}\n*[[Eltab]], demon prince of hatred and retribution.\n*[[Fraz-Urb'luu]], demon prince and patron of illusionists and tricksters.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|63}}\n*[[Graz'zt]], demon prince and patron of rulers by force.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|65}}\n*[[Juiblex]], demon prince and patron of oozes and slimes.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|66}}\n*[[Kostchtchie]], demon prince of the 23rd layer of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]], the Ice Wastes; patron of evil frost giants.<ref name=\"Frostburn\">{{cite book |authorlink=Wolfgang Baur|last=Baur |first=Wolfgang |authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|last2=Jacobs|first2=James |authorlink3=George Strayton|last3=Strayton|first3=George |title=Frostburn: Mastering the Perils of Ice and Snow |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2896-4}}</ref>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|68}}\n*[[Lolth]], demon princess of spiders, evil, darkness, chaos and assassins.

They are to the [[Celestial (Dungeons & Dragons)|celestials]] as the archdevils are to the devils and the demon lords are to demons.\n\n=====Archon paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[Archon (Dungeons & Dragons)|archons]] are known collectively as the '''Celestial Hebdomad'''. They rule the layers of the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Plane]] of [[Mount Celestia]].\n\n;[[Barachiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barachiel]]\n: ruler of the Silver Heaven of Lunia, the bottom layer of Celestia.\n;[[Domiel]]\n: ruler of the Golden Heaven of Mercuria, the second layer of Celestia.\n;[[Erathaol]]\n: ruler of Venya, the Pearly Heaven, the third layer of Celestia.\n;[[Pistis Sophia (Dungeons & Dragons)|Pistis Sophia]]\n: ruler of Solania, the Crystal Heaven, the fourth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Raziel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Raziel]]\n: ruler of Mertion, the Platinum Heaven, the fifth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Sealtiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sealtiel]]\n: ruler of Jovar, the Glittering Heaven, the sixth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Zaphkiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Zaphkiel]]\n: ruler of the Illuminated Heaven of Chronias, the seventh layer of Celestia.\n\n=====Eladrin paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[eladrin]]s are collectively known as '''The Court of Stars'''.

Spends most of his time on Amoria, the topmost layer of Elysium.\n;Vhara\n: the duchess of the Equinals, resides on Amoria.\n\n==== Archomentals ====\n[[Archomental]]s are powerful exemplary beings of the [[Inner Plane|Elemental Planes]] and the rulers of the [[Elemental (Dungeons & Dragons)|elementals]]. Although they are not truly rulers of their planes, archomentals like to consider themselves as much and often grant themselves regal titles like Prince or Princess. They are compared in the source material to the archfiends or celestial paragons, and are considered to be the elemental equivalent of such beings.\n\n===== Evil Archomentals =====\nThe evil archomentals are collectively known as the Princes of Elemental Evil. The five most famous are:\n\n*[[Cryonax]], prince of evil cold creatures.\n*[[Imix (Dungeons & Dragons)|Imix]], prince of evil fire creatures.\n*[[Ogr\u00e9moch]], prince of evil earth creatures.\n*[[Olhydra]], princess of evil water creatures.\n*[[Yan-C-Bin]], prince of evil air creatures.\n\n===== Good Archomentals =====\nThe good archomentals are collectively known as the Elemental Princes of Good.

Though true to their chaotic nature they often do not appear anything like other Slaadi.\n\n*[[Chourst]], lord of randomness.\n*[[Rennbuu]], lord of colors.\n*[[Ssendam]], lord of madness.\n*[[Wartle]], domain unknown.\n*[[Ygorl]], lord of entropy.\n\n==== Titans ====\n\"Titans are closer to the well spring of life and thus experience more pronounced emotion including Deity-like fits of rage. In ages past some rebelled against the deities themselves...\"<ref>''Monster Manual'' 3.5 edition</ref>\n\n==== The Lady of Pain ====\nThe Lady of Pain is an enigmatic being who oversees the city of [[Sigil (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sigil]] in the plane of the [[Concordant Domain of the Outlands|Outlands]]. Almost nothing is known about her; her origin, her race, her motives and her level of power are all obscure, although she is sometimes shown to have absolutely immense power. The Lady of Pain refuses to tolerate anyone who worships her, killing those who do so. Again; virtually nothing is known about her, apart from the fact that she has the power to slay gods who displease her.\n\n==== Vestiges ====\nThese entities are outside the boundary of life, death, and undeath. They are untouchable by even the most powerful deities although they can be summoned and used by the weakest mortal through pact magic and binding. Binders are often feared and hunted down by \"Witch Slayers.\" The list of vestiges that can be bonded with include:\n\n*[[Acererak]]: The Eternal.\n*[[Agares]]: Truth Betrayed.\n*[[Aamon|Amon]]: The Void Before The Altar.\n*[[Andras]]: The Grey Knight.\n*[[Andromalius]]: The Repentant Rogue.\n*[[Aim (demon)|Aym]]: Queen Avarice.\n*[[Balam (demon)|Balam]]: The Bitter Angel.\n*[[Buer (demon)|Buer]]: Grandmother Huntress.\n*[[Chupoclops]]: Harbinger of Forever.\n*[[Dahlver-Nar]]: The Tortured One.\n*[[Dantalion]]: The Star Emperor.\n*[[Eligor]]: Dragon's Slayer.\n*[[Eurynome]]: Mother of the Material.\n*[[Focalor]]: Prince of Tears.\n*Geryon: The Deposed Lord.\n*[[Haagenti]]: Mother of Minotaurs.\n*[[Malthus (demon)|Halphax]]: Angel in the Angle.\n*[[Haures]]: The Dreaming Duke.\n*[[Ipos]]: Prince of Fools.\n*[[Karsus]]: Hubris in the Blood.\n*[[Leraje]]: The Green Herald.\n*[[Malphas]]: The Turnfeather.\n*[[Marchosias]]: King of Killers.\n*[[Naberius]]: The Grinning Hound.\n*Orthos: Sovereign of the Howling Dark.\n*[[Otiax]]: The Key to the Gate.\n*[[Paimon]]: The Dancer.\n*[[Ronove]]: The Iron Maiden.\n*[[Savnok]]: The Instigator.\n*Shax: Sea Sister.\n*[[Tenebrous]]: The Shadow That Was.\n*[[Zagan (demon)|Zagan]]: Duke of Disappointment.\n\nVestiges were introduced in D&D: ''[[Tome of Magic]]'' supplement \nby Matthew Sernett, [[Ari Marmell]], [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]], [[Robert J.

The list includes long-time D&D establishments from Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, as well as several original gods. Although some gods are patrons of specific races, they are worshipped by all, and racial pantheons do not exist in this edition. Many lesser gods from previous editions (such as the Seldarine or most members of the dwarven pantheon) now have the status of Exarch, a demipower in service to a greater god.\n\n===Good and Lawful Good deities===\n*[[Avandra]] \u2013 Good Goddess of Change, Luck and Travel, Patron of Halflings.

Her name is derived from the [[Ioun stones]].\n*[[Kord (Greyhawk)|Kord]] \u2013 Unaligned God of Storms, Battle and Strength.\n*[[Melora (Dungeons & Dragons)|Melora]] \u2013 Unaligned Goddess of Wilderness, Nature and the Sea\n*[[Raven Queen]] \u2013 Unaligned Goddess of Death, Fate and Doom.

Implied to be the creator of humans, the devils wiped out all knowledge of his name, which they fear is powerful enough to revive him if it is ever spoken aloud again. The Nine Hells were originally his astral domain, now a prison for Asmodeus and his devils. A holy chalice belonging to him is mentioned in ''Divine Power''.\n* Khala \u2013 Goddess of Winter, wife of Zehir, Khala sought to trap the natural world in an eternal winter to secure power over it. Her plans convinced the primal spirits to expel gods and primordials from the world. She was killed by the other gods in a conflict called the War of Winter, who afterwards made a compact to balance darkness and light (Zehir and Pelor), and the natural seasons (Corellon, Pelor and Sehanine). Her power over winter was taken by the [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Lakal]] \u2013 God of Healing and Mercy who was also her own Astral Dominion. She was an impersonal deity who communicated with her chosen people, the Quom, through \"ecstatic moments of personal communion.\" She extolled mercy and urged her followers to dedicate themselves to pursuits that benefited the whole cosmos. Lakal's death was accidental \u2013 when Bahamut battled Nihil, the Primordial of nothingness, the pair crashed into Lakal. Bahamut was able to use the distraction to slay Nihil, but the primordial's death throes also caused Lakal to explode. The surviving quom now roam the planes, retrieving any shards of Lakal that they can find, including those unknowingly consumed by living creatures. Such creatures, including humanoids and player characters, are considered collateral damage in the quom's quest to restore Lakal. Ironically, even if the quom succeed in their quest, the restored Lakal would be disgusted with their methods.<ref>[[Rob Heinsoo|Heinsoo, Rob]], ''[[The Plane Above]]''.

Killed by The [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Tuern]] \u2013 God of War. Killed by [[Bane (Forgotten Realms)|Bane]].\n* Nusemnee \u2013 Nusemnee was the daughter of [[Zehir]]. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of [[Pelor]], she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess.

This work was superseded by the ''[[Deities & Demigods]]'' source book, which was first published in 1980.<ref>{{cite book\n | first=Lawrence |last=Schick |year=1991\n | title=Heroic Worlds: A History and Guide to Role-Playing Games\n | publisher=Prometheus Books\n | location=Buffalo, New York |isbn=0-87975-653-5}}</ref> The first printing included the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], but both this and the Melnibon\u00e9an mythos were removed by the third printing because of potential copyright issues. In 1985, the book was renamed ''Legends & Lore'' due to concerns about bad publicity. The Babylonian, Finnish, nonhuman, and Sumerian content were removed to allow room for expansion of the remaining mythoi.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDDefinitiveFAQ.asp\n | title=Dungeons & Dragons FAQ\n | publisher=Wizards of the Coast\n | accessdate=2008-11-23\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' was published as a sourcebook for the second edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. This work re-introduced detailed information on the deities of several non-human pantheons.<ref name=FAQ /> The [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faer\u00fbnian pantheon]] for the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting was more fully detailed in 1996\u20131998 with the publication of ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', ''Powers & Pantheons'' and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]''.<ref name=FAQ />\n\n===Categories===\nThe deities are grouped into three categories:\n# Core powers \u2013 Deities presented in the ''Player's Handbook 3.5th edition'' or substantially introduced in the other two core books (''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''). Most of these deities are worshipped by [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]]. There is a subset within this category called '''Additional Deities''' which has deities not mentioned in the core rulebooks but instead in supplements and as such considered additions to the core category.\n# Alternate human pantheons \u2013 This lists the pantheons and the deities within them that are presented in the supplement book ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. Most are based upon real-life mythology.\n# Non-deity powers \u2013 These beings would fit into the previous category, but are not actually deities, plus most of them aren't the patron of a specific monstrous race. This includes the demon princes and archdevils as well as some other godlike beings.\n\nBefore third edition, there was no Core Setting, so the distinctions above are not as clear-cut. For the most part, materials which did not specify a setting were assumed to be at least compatible with the World of Greyhawk if not outright parts of the canon. As such, those prior materials are covered in the setting-specific lists of deities.\n\nThe book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', however, was considered to be canon for core materials for the gods of non-human races in second edition.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Ranks of Divine Power===\nFor game purposes, each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:\n*Quasi-deities or hero deities. Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers.\n*Demigods. They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.\n*Lesser deities. These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.\n*Intermediate deities. These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.\n*Greater deities. These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.\n*Overdeities. These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.\n\n===Portfolios===\nEvery deity has certain aspects of existence over which it has dominion, power, and control. Collectively, these aspects represent a deity's portfolio.\n\n===Domains===\nEach deity that can grant spells has multiple domains that give clerics access to extra spells and abilities from that domain. Which domains are associated with a deity is largely a function of the deity's portfolio.\n\n===Divine hierarchy===\nMany deities are arranged in pantheons, which are often led by Greater deities which are their direct superiors. The individual deities in a pantheon may not be forced to obey their superiors, although they typically respect and fear the superior deity.\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons''==\n''[[Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes]]'' (1976) included the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[mythology|mythologies]], as well as [[Robert E.

They selected and altered deities to correspond to \"iconic\" aspects of core D&D. Most core deities are human deities; except for the chief gods of the demihuman races. Certain aspects of the deities were altered to make them more generic \u2013 for example: the \"Core\" Heironeous favors the longsword (in order to make the favored weapon of the \"God of Chivalry\" more traditionally knight-like), as contrasted with the original \"Greyhawk\" Heironeous, who favors the battleaxe.\n\nThe designation of \"greater\" vs. \"intermediate\" comes from ''Legends & Lore'' (1990). It is not used in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|any edition of]] the ''Player's Handbook'', but it is used in ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' (2002) and various v3.5 [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Edition]] materials.\n\n===''Core'' D&D-pantheons===\n====Greater deities====\n*Boccob, god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight.<ref name=\"PHB35\">{{cite book |authorlink=Jonathan Tweet|last=Tweet |first=Jonathan |authorlink2=Monte Cook|last2=Cook|first2=Monte |authorlink3=Skip Williams|last3=Williams|first3=Skip |title=Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook I v.3.5 |year=2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2886-7}}</ref>{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\">{{cite book |authorlink=Rich Redman|last=Redman |first=Rich |authorlink2=Skip Williams|last2=Williams|first2=Skip |authorlink3=James Wyatt (game designer)|last3=Wyatt|first3=James |title=[[Deities and Demigods]] |year=2002 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2654-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n*[[Corellon Larethian]], god of [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], magic, music, and arts (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|62}}<ref name=\"Wild\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Skip |title=Races of the Wild |year=2005 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3438-7}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n*Garl Glittergold, god of [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]], humor, and gemcutting (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|69}}<ref name=\"Stone\">{{cite book |authorlink=David Noonan (game designer)|last=Noonan |first=David |authorlink2=Jesse Decker|last2=Decker|first2=Jesse |authorlink3=Michelle Lyons|last3=Lyons|first3=Michelle |title=[[Races of Stone]] |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3278-3}}</ref>{{rp|43}}<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=David |title=Complete Divine |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3272-4}}</ref>{{rp|109,112}}\n*[[Gruumsh]], god of orcs (also a monster power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|71}}\n*[[Moradin]], god of [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]] (also a demihuman power)<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"Stone\" />{{rp|17}}\n*[[Nerull]], god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld.<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,108}}<ref name=\"LibrisMortis\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer)|first2=Bruce R.|last2=Cordell|authorlink2=Bruce R.

It worships a single deity of the same name:\n\n*Dennari, lesser goddess of earth, liberation and suffering.\n\n=== Nondeity powers ===\nSimilar to monster powers, these are not true deities but very powerful extraplanar beings.

Implied to be the creator of humans, the devils wiped out all knowledge of his name, which they fear is powerful enough to revive him if it is ever spoken aloud again. The Nine Hells were originally his astral domain, now a prison for Asmodeus and his devils. A holy chalice belonging to him is mentioned in ''Divine Power''.\n* Khala \u2013 Goddess of Winter, wife of Zehir, Khala sought to trap the natural world in an eternal winter to secure power over it. Her plans convinced the primal spirits to expel gods and primordials from the world. She was killed by the other gods in a conflict called the War of Winter, who afterwards made a compact to balance darkness and light (Zehir and Pelor), and the natural seasons (Corellon, Pelor and Sehanine). Her power over winter was taken by the [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Lakal]] \u2013 God of Healing and Mercy who was also her own Astral Dominion. She was an impersonal deity who communicated with her chosen people, the Quom, through \"ecstatic moments of personal communion.\" She extolled mercy and urged her followers to dedicate themselves to pursuits that benefited the whole cosmos. Lakal's death was accidental \u2013 when Bahamut battled Nihil, the Primordial of nothingness, the pair crashed into Lakal. Bahamut was able to use the distraction to slay Nihil, but the primordial's death throes also caused Lakal to explode. The surviving quom now roam the planes, retrieving any shards of Lakal that they can find, including those unknowingly consumed by living creatures. Such creatures, including humanoids and player characters, are considered collateral damage in the quom's quest to restore Lakal. Ironically, even if the quom succeed in their quest, the restored Lakal would be disgusted with their methods.<ref>[[Rob Heinsoo|Heinsoo, Rob]], ''[[The Plane Above]]''.

Killed by The [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Tuern]] \u2013 God of War. Killed by [[Bane (Forgotten Realms)|Bane]].\n* Nusemnee \u2013 Nusemnee was the daughter of [[Zehir]]. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of [[Pelor]], she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil. She was later killed by a poison that could kill anything\u2014even a deity\u2014that was distilled from Zehir's blood.<ref name=\"Dragon390\">{{cite book |author=Pierre Van Rooden |magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] 390 |title=Power Play: Divine - Dead Gods |year=August 2010 |page=47 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref>\n\n== Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ==\nThese are the deities for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.

The team is made up of [[Irish people|Irish]] players from the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and [[Australian Football League]].\n\nPrior to 2006, an under-19 and under-17 team had participated in a similar series, while a [[Ireland women's international rules football team|women's team]] participated in [[2006 Ladies' International Rules Series|2006]]. Currently, the Ireland team plays at least one of its home games at [[Croke Park]], with recent alternative venues being [[Pearse Stadium]] in [[County Galway|Galway]] in [[2006 International Rules Series|2006]], the [[Gaelic Grounds]] in [[County Limerick|Limerick]] in 2010 and [[Breffni Park]] in [[County Cavan|Cavan]] in 2013.\n\nAt present the only team Ireland plays is the [[Australia international rules football team]], on an annual basis in the [[International Rules Series]]. As of [[2015 International Rules Test|2015]], Ireland have won ten of 19 series, won 21 of 40 test matches played and participated in two draws, all since the inaugural [[1984 international rules series|1984 Series]].\n[[File:International rules.jpg|thumb|Ireland v.

The team is made up of [[Irish people|Irish]] players from the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and [[Australian Football League]].\n\nPrior to 2006, an under-19 and under-17 team had participated in a similar series, while a [[Ireland women's international rules football team|women's team]] participated in [[2006 Ladies International Rules Series|2006]]. Currently, the Ireland team plays at least one of its home games at [[Croke Park]], with recent alternative venues being [[Pearse Stadium]] in [[County Galway|Galway]] in [[2006 International Rules Series|2006]], the [[Gaelic Grounds]] in [[County Limerick|Limerick]] in 2010 and [[Breffni Park]] in [[County Cavan|Cavan]] in 2013.\n\nAt present the only team Ireland plays is the [[Australia international rules football team]], on an annual basis in the [[International Rules Series]]. As of [[2015 International Rules Test|2015]], Ireland have won ten of 19 series, won 21 of 40 test matches played and participated in two draws, all since the inaugural [[1984 international rules series|1984 Series]].\n[[File:International rules.jpg|thumb|Ireland v.

{"title_page": "Thomas de Rokeby (died 1356)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n'''Sir Thomas de Rokeby''' (died 1356 or 1357<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=24012|title=Rokeby, Sir Thomas}}</ref>) was a soldier and senior Crown official in fourteenth-century England and Ireland, who served as [[Justiciar of Ireland]]. He had considerable early success in restoring law and order in Ireland, which was  no doubt the  reason for his appointment as Justiciar, but he was recalled to England after the   military situation deteriorated. He was later re-appointed to the office of Justiciar, and returned to Ireland  to take up office but died soon afterwards.\n\n==Background ==\nThe Rokebys were a prominent landowning family from Mortham in [[North Yorkshire]]; Thomas was probably the son of Thomas de Rokeby, who died in 1318 (some sources name his father as Alexander).<ref>Kingsford, Charles Lethbridge \u2013   \"Sir Thomas de Rokeby\"  \u2013   ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900'' Vol. 49 p.152</ref> His nephew, also named Thomas, was closely associated with him in his later years and the elder Thomas was often called \"l'oncle\" to distinguish him from his nephew. It was almost certainly the nephew, not the uncle, who was the grandfather of  the second Sir [[Thomas de Rokeby]],  who died  after 1423.<ref>Kingsford p.152</ref>\n\n==Service in Scotland==\nRokeby first came to public attention in 1327 when, after his return from having been a prisoner in [[Scotland]], he received the thanks of the new King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], for being the [[squire]]   who had first pointed out the approach of the Scots army  during the  incursion of the  previous July. As a reward he was [[knighted]] and given lands worth \u00a3100 a year.<ref>Kingsford p.152</ref> He saw action against the Scots regularly between 1336 and 1342 and had charge of [[Stirling Castle]] and [[Edinburgh Castle]] while they were held by the English. He was [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] 1342\u20131349.

He arrived in December and made a quick circuit of the south of Ireland, mainly to keep watch on the troublesome magnate [[Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond]].<ref>Otway-Ruthven , A.J. ''History of Medieval Ireland''  Reprinted Barnes and Noble 1993 p.277</ref>\n\n===Administrative reforms===\nRokeby was praised by his contemporaries for his regard for justice and his zeal in checking the [[extortion]] of Crown officials. He undertook what has been called a general overhaul of the Irish administration, aimed particularly at the detection of corruption and the removal of incompetent officials.<ref>Otway-Ruuthven p.278</ref> Arguably he showed excessive zeal in arresting the [[Treasurer of Ireland]], [[Robert de Emeldon]], a man who enjoyed the King's personal regard.<ref>Gilbert, Sir John  ''History of the Viceroys of Ireland''  Dublin J.Duffy and Co. 1865 p.205</ref> Admittedly the charges against Emeldon were very serious, including rape, robbery and [[manslaughter]], but Rokeby must have known that the King, out of regard for their long friendship, had already [[pardoned]] Emeldon for killing one Ralph de Byrton, a [[knight]], in 1336. Emeldon  was once more pardoned and quickly released.\n\nIn November 1351 Rokeby held a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] at [[Kilkenny]]. It dealt partly with the problem of official corruption already described, partly with the problem of defence of the Pale, and partly with the question of intermarriage and other close contacts between the [[Anglo-Irish]] and the Old Irish. Otway-Ruthven notes that little of the legislation was new, apart from the application to Ireland of the English [[Statute of Labourers]] of 1351, and that much of it was repeated in the later [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] of 1366.<ref>Otway-Ruthven p.278</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\nIn 1353 the Clan [[MacCarthy of Muskerry]], the dominant clan in central [[County Cork]], who had until then been loyal to the  [[English Crown]], rebelled. Rokeby showed considerable skill in crushing the uprising and succeeded in replacing the rebellious head of the clan, Dermot MacCarthy, with his more compliant cousin Cormac.  Cormac's descendants gained  great wealth, extensive lands and the title [[Earl of Clancarty]].<ref>Otway-Ruthven p.279</ref>\n\nThis promising state of good order did not last long:  a rebellion by the O'Byrne Clan of [[Wicklow]] in 1354 was followed by a general uprising headed by the [[MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty]]. Although Muirchearteach MacMurrough-Kavanagh, styled [[King of Leinster]], was captured and executed, Rokeby suffered several military defeats. He was unable to overcome the O'Byrnes in Wicklow, and other risings took place in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[Kildare]] and [[Ulster]].<ref>Otway-Ruthven p. 280</ref>\n\n==Recall and last years==\nRokeby was now an ageing and discouraged man, and in 1355 it was decided to recall him. His replacement, rather surprisingly, was that Earl of Desmond whom it had been one of his main tasks to keep in check. Desmond died a year later on 26 July 1356.   Rokeby was reappointed Justiciar, and returned to Ireland, only to die soon afterwards at [[Kilkea Castle]].<ref>Otway-Ruthven p.282</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kilkea Castle Castledermot Ireland.jpg|thumb|[[Kilkea Castle]], Rokeby's Irish stronghold, where he died in 1356 or 1357.]]\n\n==Character==\nRokeby was a popular and respected figure in Ireland: he was  described as  \"one who paid well for his [[victuals]], and did not rob the poor\" (i.e. he  did not abuse the much criticized  system of [[purveyance]]).<ref>Kingsford p.152</ref> The citizens of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], protesting at his recall, referred to his \"evident good work\" in maintaining law and order.

He had considerable early success in restoring law and order in Ireland, which was  no doubt the  reason for his appointment as Justiciar, but he was recalled to England after the   military situation deteriorated. He was later re-appointed to the office of Justiciar, and returned to Ireland  to take up office shortly before his death.\n\n==Background ==\nThe Rokebys were a prominent landowning family from Mortham in [[North Yorkshire]]; Thomas was probably the son of Thomas de Rokeby, who died in 1318 (some sources name his father as Alexander).<ref>Kingsford, Charles Lethbridge \u2013   \"Sir Thomas de Rokeby\"  \u2013   ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900'' Vol. 49 p.152</ref> His nephew, also named Thomas, was closely associated with him in his later years and the elder Thomas was often called \"l'oncle\" to distinguish him from his nephew. It was almost certainly the nephew, not the uncle, who was the grandfather of  the second Sir [[Thomas de Rokeby]],  who died  after 1423.<ref>Kingsford p.152</ref>\n\n==Service in Scotland==\nRokeby first came to public attention in 1327 when, after his return from having been a prisoner in [[Scotland]], he received the thanks of the new King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], for being the [[squire]]   who had first pointed out the approach of the Scots army  during the  incursion of the  previous July. As a reward he was [[knighted]] and given lands worth \u00a3100 a year.<ref>Kingsford p.152</ref> He saw action against the Scots regularly between 1336 and 1342 and had charge of [[Stirling Castle]] and [[Edinburgh Castle]] while they were held by the English. He was [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] 1342\u20131349. He was one of the English commanders at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], and it was said, \"gave the Scots such a draught as they did not care to taste again\".<ref>Kingsford p.152</ref> He was then charged with bringing King [[David II of Scotland]] to London, and he received further grants of land as a reward for his  good services.\n\n==Justiciar of Ireland==\nIn 1349 he was appointed [[Justiciar of Ireland]], and given a large armed retinue to accompany him, as it was recognised by the English Crown that \"Ireland is not in good plight or good peace\".
