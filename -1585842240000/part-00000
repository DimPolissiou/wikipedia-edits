{"title_page": "Beck's monadicity theorem", "text_new": "In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Beck's monadicity theorem''' gives a criterion that characterises [[monadic functor]]s, introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Jonathan Mock|last=Beck|year=2003|authorlink=Jonathan Mock Beck}} in about 1964. It is often stated in dual form for [[comonad]]s.  It is sometimes called the '''Beck tripleability theorem''' because of the older term ''triple'' for a monad.\n\nBeck's monadicity theorem asserts that a [[functor]]\n\n:<math>U: C \\to D</math>\n\nis monadic if and only if<ref>{{harvnb|Pedicchio|Tholen|2004|p=228}}</ref>\n# ''U'' has a left [[adjoint functors|adjoint]];\n# ''U'' reflects [[isomorphism]]s; and\n# ''C'' has [[coequalizer]]s of ''U''-split parallel pairs (those parallel pairs of morphisms in ''C'', which ''U'' sends to pairs having a split coequalizer in ''D''), and ''U'' preserves those coequalizers.\n\nThere are several variations of Beck's theorem: if ''U'' has a left adjoint then any of the following conditions ensure that ''U'' is monadic:\n*''U'' reflects [[isomorphism]]s and ''C'' has [[coequalizer]]s of reflexive pairs (those with a common right inverse)  and ''U'' preserves those coequalizers.  (This gives the crude monadicity theorem.)\n*Every fork in ''C'' which is by ''U'' sent to a split coequalizer sequence in ''D'' is itself a coequalizer sequence in ''C''. In different words, ''U'' creates (preserves and reflects) ''U''-split coequalizer sequences.\n\nAnother variation of Beck's theorem characterizes strictly monadic functors: those for which the comparison functor is an isomorphism rather than just an equivalence. For this version the definitions of what it means to create coequalizers is changed slightly: the coequalizer has to be unique rather than just unique up to isomorphism.\n\nBeck's theorem is particularly important in its relation with the [[descent (category theory)|descent theory]], which plays a role in [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] and [[Stack (mathematics)|stack theory]], as well as in the [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s approach to [[algebraic geometry]]. Most cases of faithfully flat descent of [[algebraic structure]]s (e.g. those in [[Fondements de la G\u00e9ometrie Alg\u00e9brique|FGA]] and in  [[Grothendieck's S\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique|SGA1]]) are special cases of Beck's theorem. The theorem gives an exact categorical description of the process of 'descent', at this level. In 1970 the Grothendieck approach via [[fibered category|fibered categories]] and [[descent data]] was shown (by Jean B\u00e9nabou and [[Jacques Roubaud]]) to be equivalent (under some conditions) to the comonad approach. In a later work, [[Pierre Deligne]] applied Beck's theorem to [[Tannakian category]] theory, greatly simplifying the basic developments.\n\n==Examples==\n\n*It follows from Beck's theorem that the forgetful functor from compact [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff spaces]] to sets is monadic. The left adjoint is the [[Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification]], the forgetful functor preserves all colimits, and it reflects isomorphisms because any continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism. {{harvtxt|Leinster|2013}} shows that this adjunction is in fact the [[initial object|initial]] monadic adjunction extending the (non-monadic) inclusion functor of the category of [[finite set]]s into the one of all sets.\n\n*The forgetful functor from topological spaces to sets is not monadic as it does not reflect isomorphisms: continuous bijections between (non-compact or non-Hausdorff) topological spaces need not be homeomorphisms.\n\n*{{harvtxt|Negrepontis|1971|loc=\u00a71}} shows that the functor from commutative [[C*-algebras]] to sets sending such an algebra ''A'' to the [[unit ball]], i.e., the set <math>\\{a \\in A, \\|a\\| \\le 1 \\}</math>, is monadic. Negrepontis also deduces [[Gelfand duality]], i.e., the equivalence of categories between the opposite category of compact Hausdorff spaces and commutative C*-algebras can be deduced from this.\n*The powerset functor from Set<sup>op</sup> to Set is monadic, where Set is the category of sets. More generally Beck's theorem can be used to show that the powerset functor from T<sup>op</sup> to T is monadic for any topos T, which in turn is used to show that the topos T has finite colimits.\n*The forgetful functor from [[semigroup|semigroups]] to sets is monadic. This functor does not preserve arbitrary coequalizers, showing that some restriction  on the coequalizers in Beck's theorem is necessary if one wants to have conditions that are necessary and sufficient.\n*If ''B'' is a faithfully flat commutative ring over the commutative ring ''A'', then the functor ''T'' from ''A'' modules to ''B'' modules taking ''M'' to ''B''\u2297<sub>''A''</sub>''M'' is a comonad. This follows from the dual of Becks theorem, as the condition that ''B'' is flat implies that ''T'' preserves limits, while the condition that ''B'' is faithfully flat implies that ''T'' reflects isomorphisms. A coalgebra over ''T'' turns out to be essentially a ''B''-module with descent data, so the fact that ''T'' is a comonad is equivalent to the main theorem of faithfully flat descent, saying that ''B''-modules with descent are equivalent to ''A''-modules.<ref>{{harvnb|Deligne|1990|loc=\u00a74.2}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* {{nlab|id=monadicity+theorem|title=monadicity theorem}}\n* {{nlab|id=monadic+descent|title=monadic descent}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{citation|mr=2910783\n|last=Balmer |first= Paul |authorlink=Paul Balmer\n|title=Descent in triangulated categories \n|journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume= 353 |year=2012 |issue=1 |pages=109\u2013125 |doi=10.1007/s00208-011-0674-z}}\n*{{citation |first=M. |last=Barr |first2=C. |last2=Wells |title=Triples, toposes, and theories |publisher=Springer |series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften |volume=278 |year=2013 |origyear=1985 |isbn=9781489900234 }} [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/tttall.pdf pdf]\n*{{citation|mr=1987896 \n|last=Beck |first=Jonathan Mock |authorlink=Jonathan Mock Beck\n|title=Triples, algebras and cohomology \n|journal=Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories |volume=2 |year=2003 |pages=1\u201359 |origyear=1967 |url=https://www.emis.de/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/2/tr2.pdf |series=Columbia University PhD thesis}} \n*{{citation |first=Jean |last=B\u00e9nabou |authorlink=Jean B\u00e9nabou |first2=Jacques |last2=Roubaud |author2link=Jacques Roubaud |title=Monades et descente |journal=C.

This functor does not preserve arbitrary coequalizers, showing that some restriction  on the coequalizers in Beck's theorem is necessary if one wants to have conditions that are necessary and sufficient.\n*If ''B'' is a faithfully flat commutative ring over the commutative ring ''A'', then the functor ''T'' from ''A'' modules to ''B'' modules taking ''M'' to ''B''\u2297<sub>''A''</sub>''M'' is a comonad. This follows from the dual of Becks theorem, as the condition that ''B'' is flat implies that ''T'' preserves limits, while the condition that ''B'' is faithfully flat implies that ''T'' reflects isomorphisms. A coalgebra over ''T'' turns out to be essentially a ''B''-module with descent data, so the fact that ''T'' is a comonad is equivalent to the main theorem of faithfully flat descent, saying that ''B''-modules with descent are equivalent to ''A''-modules.<ref>{{harvnb|Deligne|1990|loc=\u00a74.2}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* {{nlab|id=monadicity+theorem|title=monadicity theorem}}\n* {{nlab|id=monadic+descent|title=monadic descent}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{citation|mr=2910783\n|last=Balmer |first= Paul |authorlink=Paul Balmer\n|title=Descent in triangulated categories \n|journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume= 353 |year=2012 |issue=1 |pages=109\u2013125 |doi=10.1007/s00208-011-0674-z}}\n*{{citation |first=M. |last=Barr |first2=C. |last2=Wells |title=Triples, toposes, and theories |publisher=Springer |series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften |volume=278 |year=2013 |origyear=1985 |isbn=9781489900234 }} [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/tttall.pdf pdf]\n*{{citation|mr=1987896 \n|last=Beck |first=Jonathan Mock |authorlink=Jonathan Mock Beck\n|title=Triples, algebras and cohomology \n|journal=Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories |volume=2 |year=2003 |pages=1\u201359 |origyear=1967 |url=https://www.emis.de/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/2/tr2.pdf |series=Columbia University PhD thesis}} \n*{{citation |first=Jean |last=B\u00e9nabou |authorlink=Jean B\u00e9nabou |first2=Jacques |last2=Roubaud |author2link=Jacques Roubaud |title=Monades et descente |journal=C.

It met in [[Washington, D.C.]] from March 4, 1923, to March 4, 1925, during the last months of [[Warren G. Harding]]'s [[Presidency of Warren G. Harding|presidency]], and the first years of the [[Presidency of Calvin Coolidge|administration]] of his successor, [[Calvin Coolidge]].  The apportionment of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the [[United States Census, 1910|Thirteenth Decennial Census of the United States in 1910]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.

For example, the short-lived French colony established in [[Brazil]] in the 16th century was called \"[[France Antarctique]]\".\n\nThe first formal use of the name \"Antarctica\" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]].<ref>John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13, National Library of Scotland, July 2008, ISSN 1477-4186, and also {{cite web |title=The Bartholomew Archive |url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}</ref>\n\n==Change of name==\nThe long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called ''[[Terra Australis]]'', sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled ''Sphere of the winds'', contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barth |first1=Cyriaco Jacob zum |title=Astronomia: Teutsch Astronomei |date=1545 |location=Frankfurt}}</ref> Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name ''Australia'' was used in Europe's scholarly circles.\n\nThen in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] removed the Dutch name from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]].

Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled \"Antarctica\", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size. Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''\u2014this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:\n\n{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.<ref>Flinders, Matthew.

Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.\n\n====Palaeozoic era (540\u2013250 Ma)====\nDuring the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416 [[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name=\"Stonehouse\">{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-98665-2 }}</ref>\n\n====Mesozoic era (250\u201366 Ma)====\nAs a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as \"mammal-like reptiles\", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206\u2013146 Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean.

The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.\n\nEast Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]].

The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.<ref name=\"meteorite\">{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets.

These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.

This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.\n\nSea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica (in terms of square kilometers of coverage) has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the amount of variation it has experienced in its thickness is unclear.<ref name=\"United Nations Environment Programme\">{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}</ref><ref name=\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\">{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nMelting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.<ref name=\"RignotCasassa2004\">{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.\n\nSheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 \u00b1 43, \u221265 \u00b1 26, and \u221220 \u00b1 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.<ref name=\"IMBIE2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183\u20131189 | date = 30 November 2012 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| pmid = 23197528 | bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S | hdl = 2060/20140006608 | url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt0vq404h7/qt0vq404h7.pdf?t=nuixw6 }}</ref> The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.<ref name=\"IMBIE2018\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | issue = 7709 | pages = 219\u2013222 | date = 13 June 2018 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | pmid = 29899482 | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 13 June 2018| bibcode = 2018Natur.558..219I | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132373/8/IMBIE2_accepted_v16.pdf }}</ref> NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.<ref name=\"landice\">{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nA single 2015 study by H.

This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.<ref name=\"schiermeier2009\"/> Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/8058/1/grl25793.pdf}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Geography}}\n* [[Antarctica Weather Danger Classification]]\n* [[Antarctic Plate]]\n* [[Crime in Antarctica]]\n* [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age|Holarctic-Antarctic Ice Age]]\n* [[List of mountain ranges#Antarctica|List of mountain ranges in Antarctica]]\n* [[List of volcanoes in Antarctica]]\n* [[Lists of places in Antarctica]]\n* [[North Pole]]\n* [[Religion in Antarctica]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Antarctica|n=Portal:Antarctica|m=no|mw=no}}\n* High resolution map (2018) \u2013 [https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/ Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica] ([[REMA]])\n* {{In Our Time|Antarctica.|b00ss2th|Antarctica. }}\n* {{curlie|Regional/Polar_Regions/Antarctic/|Antarctic region}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|ay|Antarctica}}\n* [http://www.bsae2012.co.uk/ British Services Antarctic Expedition 2012]\n* [http://www.ats.aq/ Antarctic Treaty Secretariat], ''de facto'' government\n* [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ British Antarctic Survey (BAS)]\n* [http://www.usap.gov/ U.S. Antarctic Program Portal]\n* [http://www.antarctica.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division]\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/international/frd/antarctica/antarctica.html Portals on the World \u2013 Antarctica] from the [[Library of Congress]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150214121701/http://lima.nasa.gov/ NASA's LIMA] (Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica) ([http://lima.usgs.gov/ USGS mirror])\n* [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov The Antarctic Sun] (Online newspaper of the U.S. Antarctic Program)\n* [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/antarctica-and-nz Antarctica and New Zealand (NZHistory.net.nz)]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/08/23/science/23saw_antarctica.html Journey to Antarctica in 1959]\n* Listen to Ernest Shackleton describing his 1908 [http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/my-south-polar-expedition South Pole Expedition]\n* [http://cdn.antarcticglaciers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Antarctic_subglacial_lakes.jpg Map of Antarctican subglacial lakes]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_om9h7vQXh0 Video: The Bedrock Beneath Antarctica]\n* [https://www.coolantarctica.com/Community/antarctic_slang.php Slang used in Antarctica]\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/310 The Papers of Henry Francis Jr.] at Dartmouth College Library\n{{Antarctica |expanded}}\n{{Continents of the world}}\n{{Deserts}}\n{{Polar exploration |state=collapsed}}\n{{Countries and territories bordering the Indian Ocean}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{coord|-90|0|region:AQ_scale:60000000|display=title}}\n{{Featured article}}\n\n[[Category:Antarctica| ]]\n[[Category:Antarctic region]]\n[[Category:Continents]]\n[[Category:Demilitarized zones]]\n[[Category:Extreme points of Earth]]\n[[Category:Polar regions of the Earth]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the continent}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Continent}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox continent\n|title = Antarctica\n|image = Antarctica (orthographic projection).svg <!--Please see discussion or contribute to discussion if you are considering replacing this image-->\n|image_size = 256px\n|alt = This map uses an orthographic projection, near-polar aspect.

Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled \"Antarctica\", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size. Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''\u2014this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:\n\n{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.<ref>Flinders, Matthew.

Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.\n\n====Palaeozoic era (540\u2013250 Ma)====\nDuring the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416 [[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name=\"Stonehouse\">{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-98665-2 }}</ref>\n\n====Mesozoic era (250\u201366 Ma)====\nAs a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as \"mammal-like reptiles\", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206\u2013146 Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period. In West Antarctica, [[conifer]]ous [[forest]]s dominated through the entire [[Cretaceous]] period (146\u201366 Ma), though [[Nothofagus|southern beech]] became more prominent towards the end of this period.

This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.\n\nEast Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.\n\nThe main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.<ref name=\"Trewby2002\" /> It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains.

During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter.

The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.\n\nThe first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbj\u00f8rg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen.

The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.<ref name=\"meteorite\">{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThis large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets.

These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies.

This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.\n\nSea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica (in terms of square kilometers of coverage) has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the amount of variation it has experienced in its thickness is unclear.<ref name=\"United Nations Environment Programme\">{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}</ref><ref name=\"National Snow and Ice Data Center\">{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nMelting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.<ref name=\"RignotCasassa2004\">{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /> This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.\n\nSheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 \u00b1 43, \u221265 \u00b1 26, and \u221220 \u00b1 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.<ref name=\"IMBIE2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183\u20131189 | date = 30 November 2012 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| pmid = 23197528 | bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S | hdl = 2060/20140006608 | url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt0vq404h7/qt0vq404h7.pdf?t=nuixw6 }}</ref> The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.<ref name=\"IMBIE2018\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | issue = 7709 | pages = 219\u2013222 | date = 13 June 2018 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | pmid = 29899482 | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 13 June 2018| bibcode = 2018Natur.558..219I | url = http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132373/8/IMBIE2_accepted_v16.pdf }}</ref> NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.<ref name=\"landice\">{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nA single 2015 study by H.

It is most widely known as the '''pipi''' (also spelled ''pippi'', plural ''pipis'' or ''pippies'') in the eastern states of its native Australia. In [[South Australia]], it is called the '''Coorong cockle''', '''Goolwa cockle''', or '''Goolwa pipi''', for the region where it is most abundant, or by its [[Ngarrindjeri language|Ngarrindjeri]] name, '''kuti'''.  In south-eastern [[Queensland]], it is often also known as '''eugarie''' or ('''y''')'''ugari''', a borrowing from the local [[Yugambeh language|Yugambeh]] and [[Turrbal language|Ugarapul]] languages.\n\nThis species should not be confused with the bivalve ''[[Paphies australis]]'' (of the family [[Mesodesmatidae]]), endemic to [[New Zealand]] and also called \"pipi\".\n\n==Life cycle==\n''P. deltoides'' is an edible bivalve mollusc primarily found from the [[Eyre Peninsula]] to [[Kingston SE]] in South Australia and from [[Tasmania]] to [[Fraser Island]] in [[Queensland]], with [[Younghusband Peninsula]] (Coorong Beach) in South Australia the site of the largest stock abundance in Australia, where they make up 85% of the total biomass.

They use a strong foot to burrow into the sand to an average depth of {{Convert|100|mm|abbr=in}} and feed by filtering [[phytoplankton]] from the water.

They are [[Dioecy|dioecious]] serial broadcast spawners, with spawning taking place over a long period of time peaking in the spring. [[Larva]]e drift as [[plankton]] for four to eight weeks in the coastal currents, often travelling large distances. They need heavy [[breaking wave|surf]] to live, as the surf concentrates the phytoplankton they feed on and increases the oxygen in the water; after periods of calm weather, they begin to die off.<ref>[http://new.dpi.vic.gov.au/fisheries/recreational-fishing/bag-and-size-limits/reduced-pipi-catch-limit/fn0609-pipis-now-and-forever---venus-bay-to-host-new-research-project Pipis Now and Forever] State Government Department of Primary Industry, Victoria</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n''Donax delto\u00efdes'' was was first named and briefly described by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in 1818.

A properly documented journal entry consists of the correct date, amount(s) that will be debited, amount that will be credited, narration of the transaction, and unique reference number (i.e. check number).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackline.com/blog/finance-automation/what-is-a-journal-entry/|title=What Is A Journal Entry?|date=2018-08-30|website=BlackLine Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\n\nIn order to record journal entries, one needs to have knowledge about:\n\n# Type of Accounts\n# Golden Rules of Accounting\n# Experience of Working\n# Knowledge on debit and credit transactions\n\n== Type of accounts ==\nThere are three types of accounts in accounting:\n\n# Personal account\n# Real account \n# Nominal account\n\n'''Personal accounts''' consist of all those accounts which are related to a person, business, firm, etc...

The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* On 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

It may take 2\u201314 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* On 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]], a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams.

The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]].

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

[[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company.

''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]], a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]].
