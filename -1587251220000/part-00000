There are more than 50 discovered [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the [[Thracians]]. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The [[Panagyurishte Treasure]] unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164&nbsp;kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the fall of Rome.\n\nMost of the region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are [[Tsepina]] near the village of [[Dorkovo]] and [[Krasen (fortress)|Krasen]] in the vicinities of [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]].\n\nThe [[April Uprising]] of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of [[Panagyurishte]] became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the [[Batak massacre]]. According to the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region [[Eastern Rumelia]] which [[Unification of Bulgaria|united]] with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] on 6 September 1885.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oborishte127.JPG|left|thumb|The village of [[Oborishte]].]]\n\nThe Pazardzhik Province is situated in central part of southern Bulgaria and borders the provinces of [[Plovdiv Province|Plovdiv]], [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]] and [[Sofia Province|Sofia]]. The total area of the region is 4,458&nbsp;km\u00b2 which is 4% of the national territory. Forests account for more than half of the area (57.1%); the arable land is 35.6%, urban territory is 3.3%, rivers and lakes occupy 2.6%, road infrastructure - 0.6% and quarries and mines - 0,4%.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\n[[File:Panagyurishte-library.jpg|thumb|The [[chitalishte]] \"Videlina\" in [[Panagyurishte]].]]\nThe northern parts of the region include the middle ridges of the [[Sredna Gora]] mountain, to the south the relief flattens and forms the western-most parts of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] and to the south are located the [[Rhodope Mountains]] where most of the forests are situated. The highest point of the region is Savov Vrah at an altitude of 2,306 m while the lowest altitude is around 200 m in the plains of the central area.<ref name=\"of\">[http://www.pz.government.bg/pz/fr_engl.html Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]</ref> The climate is transcontinental with milder winter than northern Bulgaria in the lowlands but with very low temperatures and high snowfall in the mountain areas. The average annual temperature is 11.3&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\nThe province is abundant in [[water resources]], its main [[waterway]] is the river [[Maritsa]] and its [[catchment basin]] includes the [[Topolnitsa River]] and [[Luda Yana River]] from the north and Stara Reka from the south. There are three main reservoirs all situated in the Rhodope Mountains within the municipal limits of [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]] - [[Batak Reservoir]], [[Golyam Beglik]] and [[Shiroka Polyana]]. A fourth large dam lake, the [[Dospat Reservoir]] is only partially in the region. In Sredna Gora to the north is [[Topolnitsa Reservoir]] shared with the Sofia Province and a dam near Panagyurishte which is in initial stages of construction.\n\n==Municipalities==\n[[Image:Pazardzik Oblast map.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Pazardzik Province]]\nThe Pazardzik province (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, ''oblast'') contains 12 municipalities ({{lang-bg|\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430|translit=obshtina}} - plural: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, {{transl|bg|obshtini}}).

The \"Batashki Vodnosilov Pat\" is an important hydrocomplex consisting of three hydro power plants- \"Batak\", \"Peshtera\" and \"Aleko\" with combined capacity of around 250 MW. Copper extracting industry is of national and European importance with major mines located around Panagyurishte (Asarel and Medet), [[Elshitsa]], [[Tsar Asen]] and [[Mina Radka]]. Machine building industry is developed in [[Pazardzhik]] (lead acid batteries), [[Panagyurishte]] (optical), [[Velingrad]]. There is flourishing pharmaceutical industry in [[Peshtera]] with more than 1 000 employees in the plant. Paper industry is developed in [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Timber industry is very important in the southern part of the region (the Rhodopes)- [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Peshtera]], [[Rakitovo]] and [[Velingrad]]. The manufacturing of textiles is well developed in [[Pazardzhik]], [[Panagyurishte]] and [[Velingrad]]. There is a huge footwear plant in [[Peshtera]]. Food processing industry is developed in most of the towns.\nAgriculture is also important, especially in the fertile central parts of the region. The most important crops are orchards (apples, plums and strawberries), grapes, wheat, barley, rye and rice.  Livestock breeding is relatively well developed in the mountainous areas.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:BatakChurch.JPG|thumb|left|A church in [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]].]]\nThe province has considerable opportunities to develop mountain and rural tourism, especially in the southern parts where the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains are located. The slopes are covered with dense deciduous and higher up, coniferous forests, dotted with numerous artificial lakes. The largest one is the [[Batak Dam]], on whose shores are built two resorts: ''Tsigov Chark'' and ''Saint Konstantin'' as well as many villas and shrines.  Fish is abundant in the dams, including [[carp]], [[rudd]], [[Rutilus|roach]] [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], [[perch]], [[zander]] and many others; the mountain streams are rich in [[trout]].  There are spa resorts in [[Velingrad]], [[Strelcha]], [[Banya, Pazardzhik Province|Banya]], [[Varvara, Pazardzhik Province|Varvara]].  The most famous landmarks are located in [[Panagyurishte]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Velingrad]].\n\nImpressive ruins of an ancient basilica (the [[Belovo Basilica]]) rise in the hilly country, close to the town of [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Numerous ruined fortresses are scattered around the province, the most famous of these are [[Tsepina]], and the ramparts near [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]] and [[Strelcha]]. The medieval [[Church of St Demetrius, Patalenitsa|Church of St Demetrius]] in the village of [[Patalenitsa]] has frescoes dating to the 12th\u201313th century.\n\n==Transportation and communications==\nThe road network is not dense.  The [[Trakiya motorway]] runs through the middle of the region. The main railway between [[Sofia]] and [[Plovdiv]] also runs through it.  There are two other railways: to [[Panagyurishte]] and to [[Peshtera]].  There are several military airports. \nAs everywhere in [[Bulgaria]], every town and village in the region is provided with electricity, drinking water and telephone network.  Each town and some villages are provided with Internet connection, and the cellular phone coverage is almost 100%, as most people own GSMs.\nSome of the interconnecting roads, especially higher up the mountain, are currently in a very bad state following heavy downpours in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n*[[List of villages in Pazardzhik Province]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pz.government.bg/news.php Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Pazardzhik Province\n|North     = [[Sofia Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Plovdiv Province]]\n|Southeast = [[Smolyan Province]]\n|South     = \n|Southwest = [[Blagoevgrad Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[Sofia Province]]\n}}\n\n<br/>{{Provinces of Bulgaria}}\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Pazardzhik Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|42|5|N|24|15|E|region:BG|display=title}}\n{{Short description|Province of Bulgaria}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Pazardzhik Province\n| native_name             = \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u041f\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\n| native_name_lang        = bul<!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"bul\" for Bulgarian.

There are more than 50 discovered [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the [[Thracians]]. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The [[Panagyurishte Treasure]] unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164&nbsp;kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the fall of Rome.\n\nMost of the region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are [[Tsepina]] near the village of [[Dorkovo]] and [[Krasen (fortress)|Krasen]] in the vicinities of [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]].\n\nThe [[April Uprising]] of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of [[Panagyurishte]] became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the [[Batak massacre]]. According to the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region [[Eastern Rumelia]] which [[Unification of Bulgaria|united]] with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] on 6 September 1885.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oborishte127.JPG|left|thumb|The village of [[Oborishte]].]]\n\nThe Pazardzhik Province is situated in central part of southern Bulgaria and borders the provinces of [[Plovdiv Province|Plovdiv]], [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]] and [[Sofia Province|Sofia]]. The total area of the region is 4,458&nbsp;km\u00b2 which is 4% of the national territory. Forests account for more than half of the area (57.1%); the arable land is 35.6%, urban territory is 3.3%, rivers and lakes occupy 2.6%, road infrastructure - 0.6% and quarries and mines - 0,4%.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\n[[File:Panagyurishte-library.jpg|thumb|The [[chitalishte]] \"Videlina\" in [[Panagyurishte]].]]\nThe northern parts of the region include the middle ridges of the [[Sredna Gora]] mountain, to the south the relief flattens and forms the western-most parts of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] and to the south are located the [[Rhodope Mountains]] where most of the forests are situated. The highest point of the region is Savov Vrah at an altitude of 2,306 m while the lowest altitude is around 200 m in the plains of the central area.<ref name=\"of\">[http://www.pz.government.bg/pz/fr_engl.html Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]</ref> The climate is transcontinental with milder winter than northern Bulgaria in the lowlands but with very low temperatures and high snowfall in the mountain areas.

The \"Batashki Vodnosilov Pat\" is an important hydrocomplex consisting of three hydro power plants- \"Batak\", \"Peshtera\" and \"Aleko\" with combined capacity of around 250 MW. Copper extracting industry is of national and European importance with major mines located around Panagyurishte (Asarel and Medet), [[Elshitsa]], [[Tsar Asen]] and [[Mina Radka]]. Machine building industry is developed in [[Pazardzhik]] (lead acid batteries), [[Panagyurishte]] (optical), [[Velingrad]]. There is flourishing pharmaceutical industry in [[Peshtera]] with more than 1 000 employees in the plant. Paper industry is developed in [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Timber industry is very important in the southern part of the region (the Rhodopes)- [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Peshtera]], [[Rakitovo]] and [[Velingrad]]. The manufacturing of textiles is well developed in [[Pazardzhik]], [[Panagyurishte]] and [[Velingrad]]. There is a huge footwear plant in [[Peshtera]]. Food processing industry is developed in most of the towns.\nAgriculture is also important, especially in the fertile central parts of the region. The most important crops are orchards (apples, plums and strawberries), grapes, wheat, barley, rye and rice.  Livestock breeding is relatively well developed in the mountainous areas.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:BatakChurch.JPG|thumb|left|A church in [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]].]]\nThe province has considerable opportunities to develop mountain and rural tourism, especially in the southern parts where the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains are located. The slopes are covered with dense deciduous and higher up, coniferous forests, dotted with numerous artificial lakes. The largest one is the [[Batak Dam]], on whose shores are built two resorts: ''Tsigov Chark'' and ''Saint Konstantin'' as well as many villas and shrines.  Fish is abundant in the dams, including [[carp]], [[rudd]], [[Rutilus|roach]] [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], [[perch]], [[zander]] and many others; the mountain streams are rich in [[trout]].  There are spa resorts in [[Velingrad]], [[Strelcha]], [[Banya, Pazardzhik Province|Banya]], [[Varvara, Pazardzhik Province|Varvara]].  The most famous landmarks are located in [[Panagyurishte]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Velingrad]].\n\nImpressive ruins of an ancient basilica (the [[Belovo Basilica]]) rise in the hilly country, close to the town of [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Numerous ruined fortresses are scattered around the province, the most famous of these are [[Tsepina]], and the ramparts near [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]] and [[Strelcha]]. The medieval [[Church of St Demetrius, Patalenitsa|Church of St Demetrius]] in the village of [[Patalenitsa]] has frescoes dating to the 12th\u201313th century.\n\n==Transportation and communications==\nThe road network is not dense.  The [[Trakiya motorway]] runs through the middle of the region. The main railway between [[Sofia]] and [[Plovdiv]] also runs through it.  There are two other railways: to [[Panagyurishte]] and to [[Peshtera]].  There are several military airports. \nAs everywhere in [[Bulgaria]], every town and village in the region is provided with electricity, drinking water and telephone network.  Each town and some villages are provided with Internet connection, and the cellular phone coverage is almost 100%, as most people own GSMs.\nSome of the interconnecting roads, especially higher up the mountain, are currently in a very bad state following heavy downpours in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n*[[List of villages in Pazardzhik Province]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pz.government.bg/news.php Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Pazardzhik Province\n|North     = [[Sofia Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Plovdiv Province]]\n|Southeast = [[Smolyan Province]]\n|South     = \n|Southwest = [[Blagoevgrad Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[Sofia Province]]\n}}\n\n<br/>{{Provinces of Bulgaria}}\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Pazardzhik Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePopulation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazardzhik_Province"}

Seventy percent of the Earth's surface are occupied by [[sedimentary basins]]<ref name = Watts>Watts, A.B., The Formation of Sedimentary Basins. In \"Understanding the Earth\", Chapter 15, Cambridge University Press., 1992</ref> \u2013 volumes consisted of [[sediments]] accumulated during million years, and alternated by long interruptions in sedimentation (hiatuses). The most noticeable feature of the [[rocks]], which filled the basins, is layering ([[stratification]])<ref> \"stratification | geology\". Encyclopedia Britannica.</ref>. [[Stratigraphy]] is a part of Geology that investigates the phenomenon of layering. It describes the sequence of layers in the basin as consisted of [[stratigraphic units]]. Units are defined on the basis of their lithology and have no clear definition<ref>Chapter 5. Lithostratigraphic Units\". International Commission on Stratigraphy. 2013\u20132014.</ref>.  Geological Perspective Correlation (GPC) is a theory that divided the geological cross-section in units according strong mathematical rule: all borders of layers in this unit obey the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]] <ref>Young, John Wesley (1930), Projective Geometry, The Carus Mathematical Monographs (#4), Mathematical Association of America</ref>.<br>\n[[Sedimentation]] layers are mainly created in shallow waters of oceans, seas, and lakes. As new layers are deposited the old ones are sinking deeper due to the weight of accumulating sediments<ref>Allen, Philip A.; John R. Allen (2008). Basin analysis : principles and applications (2. ed., [Nachdr.] ed.). Malden, MA [u.a.]: Blackwell. </ref>. The content of sedimentary layers (lithological and biological), their order in the sequence, and  geometrical characteristics keep records of the history of the [[Earth]], of past [[climate]], sea-level and environment<ref name = Watts></ref>. Most knowledge about the [[sedimentary basins]] came from exploration drilling when searching for oil and gas. The essential feature of this information is that each layer is penetrated by the wells in a number of scattered locations. This raises the problem of identifying each layer in all wells \u2013 the geological correlation problem<ref name=succession>Van Wagoner J., Mitchum R., Campion, K. and Rahmanian V. Siliciclastic Sequence Stratigraphy in Well Logs, Cores, and Outcrops: Concepts for High-Resolution Correlation of Time and Facies AAPG Methods in Exploration Series, No. 7, 1990.</ref>. The identification is based on comparison of 1) physical and mineralogical characteristics of the particular layer (lithostratigraphy), or 2) petrified remnants in this layer (biostratigraphy)<ref> Kearey, Philip (2001). Dictionary of Geology (2nd ed.) London, New York, etc.: Penguin Reference, London, p. 123</ref>. The similarity of layers is decreasing as the distance between the cross-sections increases that leads to ambiguity of the correlation scheme that indicates which layers penetrated at different locations belong to the same body (see A). To improve the results geologists take in consideration the spatial relations between layers, which restricted the number of acceptable correlations. The first restriction was formulated in XVII century: the sequence of layers is the same in any cross-section.  The second one was discovered by Haites in 1963<ref name=Haites>T. Binnert Heites. (1963). Perspective correlation. APG Bulletin vol. 47, N 4. </ref>: In an undisturbed sequence of layers (strata) the thicknesses (H1 and H2) of any layer observed in two different locations obey the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]], i.e the perspective ratio K = H1/H2 is the same for all layers in this succession. This theory attracted attention around the world<ref name=Miall></ref><ref name=Tipper></ref><ref name=Hansen></ref>, and particularly in Russia <ref name=GubCorr></ref><ref name=Edel></ref><ref name=Salin></ref>. The theory is also a basis of the method of graphical correlation in biostratigraphy widely used in oil and coal industries<ref name=Shaw ></ref><ref name=Edwards></ref> <ref name=Nemec>Nemec W.

The porous layer is saturated with water, oil, and gas]]\nThe geometry is the main lead to natural resources exploration.[[File:Lithocorrelation.png|thumb|(A) Correlation scheme indicates which layers penetrated at different locations belong to the same body]]For example, the oil geologists are looking for permeable layers of particular geometry, which allows keeping the oil in place<ref>Levorsen, A.I. (1967), Geology of Petroleum, W.H.Freeman and Company, San Francisco, 724 p.</ref> (for instance, the domed shape [[Petroleum trap|anticlinal trap]]). The ore geologists are looking for  [[Fault (geology)|faults]] in the sediments \u2013 the ways, which deliver the melted mantle materials to the upper crust<ref>Evans A. Ore Geology and Industrial Minerals. 2005</ref>. Knowledge about underground geometry of the [[sedimentary basins]] comes from geological observations, [[Geophysics|geophysical measurements]] and from [[Oil well|drilling]]<ref>Freudenrich C., Strickland J. How Oil Drilling Works. https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-drilling.htm</ref>. Drilling gives the most detailed information about the position, thickness, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of each layer, but the point is that each well presents all this information in one location on the layer. Because the geometry of a layer can be very complicated it becomes a difficult problem and requires a significant number of drilled wells.\nThe challenge is identifying in each well the interval that belongs to the same layer now or in the past<ref>Voronin, Y.A., Methodological issues of application of mathematical methods and computers in geology. Published by the Computer Center, Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Novosibirsk, Yakutsk: 1973.</ref> (see A). To do this geologists use all available characteristics of the layer. Only after this it is possible to begin the recovery of the geometry of the layer (to be more precise \u2013 the geometry of the top and bottom surfaces of the layer). This procedure is called geological correlation<ref name=succession></ref>, and the results are presented as a[[Lithostratigraphy|correlation scheme]] (A). It is natural that at the beginning of the exploration, when the number of wells is small, the correlation scheme contains expensive mistakes<ref name = Randle>Randle C.,  Bond C.,  Lark M.,  Monaghan A.

When the distances between available cross-sections are decreasing (for example, by drilling new wells) the quality of correlation is improving, but meanwhile the wrong geological decisions could be made that increases the expenses of geological projects. From Steno's principle of initial horizontality follows that the top borders of the layers (tops) were initially flat, and remained flat until the complete succession stays undisturbed by subsequent tectonic movements, but no regularities about the geometric relations between these flat surfaces in the succession were known. The first to shed light on the problem was Canadian geologist Binner Heites: in 1963 he published the Geological Perspective Correlation hypothesis<ref name=Haites></ref>. Perspective geological correlation is a theory that establishes strong geometrical restrictions on the geometry of the layers in sedimentary deposits.\n\n==Perspective geometry in undisturbed succession of layers ==\n[[File:Haites perspective correlation.png|thumb| (B) Heites' perspective correlation]] [[File:W Fig 4.png|thumb|(C) Correlation plot]]\nIn 1963 the Canadian geologist Binner Heites discovered a strong regularity of the layering in [[sedimentary basins]]: the thicknesses of layers within each [[stratigraphic unit]] are governed by the law of  [[perspective (geometry)|perspective correspondence]] <ref name=Haites></ref>. It means that in undisturbed succession on the correlation scheme  the straight lines drawn through the border points of the same layer in two cross-sections intersect in one point \u2013 ''center of perspectivity'' (see B). \nFor geological purposes more convenient geometrical presentation of perspective relations is the correlation plot proposed by Jekhowsky<ref>Jekhowsky, B. de, La methode des distances minimales, nouveau procede quantitative de correlation stratigraphique, exemple d'application on paleontologie. ''Rev. Inst. Fran\u00e7. Du Petrole'', Paris, 1963, vol. XVIII, No. 5, 629\u2013653.</ref> (see C): the depths of the layer's borders in one geologic cross-section are plotted along axis h\u2032 (h1\u2032, h2\u2032, h3\u2032,...), and the position of the same layers in another  cross-section are plotted along axis h\u2032\u2032 (h1\u2032\u2032, h2\u2032\u2032, h3\u2032\u2032, ...). Points 1, 2, 3 \u2026  with coordinates (h1\u2032, h1\u2032\u2032), (h2\u2032, h2\u2032\u2032), and (h3\u2032, h3\u2032\u2032), accordingly, are called ''correlation points'', and a curve drawn through these points, a ''correlation line''. Black dots (''connectors'') represent the relative position of correlated borders on the plot. When the layers geometry satisfies the conditions of perspective correspondence the correlation line is a straight line. In the particular case of parallel layers  the inclination of the ''correlation line'' is 45<sup>0</sup>. \nThe Perspective Geological Correlation also states that \n#each [[sedimentary basin]] consists of a number of [[stratigraphic units]] (sequence of layers without [[unconformities]]) , and\n#in each unit the relations between the thicknesses of the layers in two cross-sections  satisfy the perspective geometry conditions with individual ratios K.\n\nHeites also concludes that all [[strata]] in each unit were governed by the same rate of deposition, and their borders are synchronous time-planes.  Each layer has different thicknesses in different locations, but they lasted equally long. It was a significant input in [[chronostratigraphy]].\n\nThe following are consequences of the basic statements:<br>\n#  In different stratigraphic horizons the slopes of the correlation lines are different.  \n# If two adjacent sections have the same slope then both sections belong to the same stratigraphic horizon.  The gap between the lines indicates a fault.    \n# If on the correlation line that presents the undisturbed stratigraphic succession one correlation point doesn't fit the line it means that<br>a) the correlation of the tops of the corresponding layer is wrong, or<br>       b) lithologic replacement.\n\n== Connections to traditional lithostratigraphy == \nThe Perspective Geological Correlation is well grounded in traditional [[geology]]. The method of convergence maps serves for determining the structure of the layer based on the known structure of the layers lying above. It is based on the assumption that the layers are close to parallel<ref>Hain, B.E., and Lomidze, M.G., 1995, Geotectonica s osnovami geodinamiki ( Geotectonics with basics of geodynamics): Moscow State University, Moscow, 480</ref> Convergence map shows lines of equal distance ([[Isopach map|isopach lines]]) between key layer and target layer<ref>Tearpock, Daniel J. and Bischke, Richard E. (2002), Applied Subsurface Geological Mapping with Structural Methods (2nd Edition), Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs 822 p.</ref>. If the layers are parallel the distance between these layers is constant,  the structures of both layers are identical, and to determine depths of the target horizon it is enough to get only one deep well, which reached the target layer.  But in reality such conditions are extremely rare. In reality restoring the geometry of the target horizon demands a number of deep wells in the area. In this case the standard procedure for calculating the distance between the target layer and key layer ''in any point'' in the area is linear interpolation between the known wells<ref>Yang Q. & Bursik M. A new interpolation method to model thickness, isopachs, extent, and volume of tephra fall deposits. Bulletin of Volcanology volume  78, article number 68 (2016).</ref>. The reliability of the result (the geometrical structure of the target horizon) is estimated by the analysis of the trend of the distances between key horizon and target horizon (isopachs): if the trend is regular, for example, the distances are monotonically changing in one direction, it is a sign of reliability of the reconstruction. In the simplest case the surface of the target horizon is a [[general position|plain in general position]], and the linear interpolation gives the correct result. The assumptions of the convergence method are consequences of the perspective correlations theory<ref name=Unorthodox></ref>, so, the method obtains the theoretical background. The theory also gave an additional criteria for the validity of the reconstructed surface. It defines the stratigraphic interval where layers were deposited without interruption, and where the layers' thicknesses satisfy the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]].The convergence maps deliver the correct result only when the layers belong to such stratigraphic unit.\n\n== Testing ==\n[[File:One stratigraphic unit.png|thumb|left|(D) Correlation plot for two cross-sections in Innisfail field (Alberta.

All four tilts of the linear segments are different, which indicates on three unconformities]]\nIn 1964 Shaw proposed the method of correlating fossiliferous stratigraphic profiles using the two-axis graph (H) <ref name= Shaw >Shaw, A. B., 1964, Time in Stratigraphy: New York, McGraw-Hill, 365 p. </ref>. The markers on each axis are the observed depths of lowest (FAD) and highest (LAD) occurrences of a specially defined group of fossils([[taxons]]).  The appearances/ disappearances of taxa are regarded as synchronous and used as markers of correlation. When projected on a graph, the corresponding points of two compared profiles form the Line of Correlation (LOC).  Shaw showed that the ideal LOC consists of linear segments (H).  Such conditions occur when the number of collected fossils is big, and one can be sure that the material covers the complete range of fossils appearance, and FADs and LADs can be accurately determined. In the reality, some sampled ranges will be shorter than true ranges, and this can disturb the linearity of the LOC.  \n\nIn every stratigraphic interval correlated ends of the range (FAD or LAD) belong to the same time surface, and in each geological cross-section (well or outcrop) this interval has identical duration but different thickness. It means that accumulation rates (thickness-to-duration ratio = tg \u03b2) are different in different locations. From the fact that the relation of durations of the units and their thicknesses are linear follows that in the limits of the linear section of LOC all strata have the same accumulation rate. \n\nThe reliability and accuracy of Shaw's method have been tested by Edwards<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, L.E.

Guberman proposed a model of the process of [[sedimentation]]<ref name=Unorthodox></ref><ref>Guberman S. Informal analysis in geology and geophysics. Moscow, Nedra, 1986.</ref>According Haites\u2019 theory in the given sedimentary basin in each stratigraphic unit the condition of perspective correspondence are satisfied in any pair of wells<ref name=Haites></ref>.  From this follows that the tops and bases of the layers in this [[stratigraphic unit]] satisfy the conditions of perspective correspondence in 3-D space (K). Any three points of a plane define the complete plane. It means that if in three wells  the thicknesses of layers belonging to the same stratigraphic unit are known, then the thicknesses of these layers can be calculated for any location in the basin. Accordingly, if the structure of the top border of the stratigraphic unit is known, the structure of any other border in this unit can be calculated.\nThe model of creating such sophisticated geometrical pattern is based on the first Steno\u2019s principle: the strata are originally horizontal, i.e. are planes. It occurs in the shallow waters due the torbulence of the undersurface layer of water. The second Steno\u2019s principle , which indicates the creation of a series of sedimentary layers lying on top of each others, supposes the subsidence of the basin. The sinking of the basin follows the strong geometrical restrictions: the tectonic bloc, which carry the basin, is rotating around the straight line parallel to the water surface, and located  onshore (L). As a result until the moment of main tectonic disturbance all borders of the layers remain flat and the geometrical inter-relations are described as perspective correspomdence. In the future the tectonic movements will distort the shape of the layers \u2013 the borders will no more be planes, but in majority of cases the changes are smooth and the perspective relations are maintained.\nThis model allows specifying some geological terms. The Steno's horizontality principle has to state: the top surface of the sediments is horizontal.The conformity is a fundamental notion in stratigraphy. Until now this term is used in two different meanings: a surface between two stratigraphic sequances, and the relationship between two stratigraphic units. Sometimes both were used in the same paragraph (see <ref>Shanmugan G. Origin, Recognition, and Importance of Erosional Unconformities in Sedimentary Basins. (In: Ed. K.L. Kleinspehn, . C. Paola . New Perspectives in Basin Analysis.  Springer, 1988.</ref>, page 84).Perspective correlation principle allows to define the notion of conformity: sequence of layers that obey the conditions of geometrical perspective is a unit of conformity. Two neighboring units of conformity are in relation of unconformity.  <br>\n\tHere is an example that shows that the borders of undisturbed stratigraphic unit in the Middle Carboniferous  (Volga-Ural oil province, Russia) initially were plains. In the central part of the area (about 100 km in diameter) were chosen three wells at distances of 10 \u2013 15 km..  The three tops of the stratigraphic unit  in the three wells are points in 3D space with coordinates  x, y, z , where x and y are present the position of the well on the surface (M), and z is the thickness of the stratigraphic unit  in this location. They  determine the top plain of the unit as it was at the time of its creation. The three bases determine the bottom plane of the unit at it was at the same time.  This allowed calculateing the thickness of the stratigraphic unit at any point in the area. Because the area was well enough drilled the calculated numbers can be compared with the real numbers. The average difference equals 2%.\n\n\n{{clearboth}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n\n\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Stratigraphy]]\n[[Category:Sediments]]\n[[Category:Sedimentary basins]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Theory in Earth sciences}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=to follow [[MOS:REFPUNC]], references come after punctuation|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n'''Geological perspective correlation''' is a theory in [[geology]] describing geometrical regularities in the layering of sediments.

The essential feature of this information is that each layer is penetrated by the wells in a number of scattered locations.

The similarity of layers is decreasing as the distance between the cross-sections increases that leads to ambiguity of the correlation scheme that indicates which layers penetrated at different locations belong to the same body (see A). To improve the results geologists take in consideration the spatial relations between layers, which restricted the number of acceptable correlations. The first restriction was formulated in XVII century: the sequence of layers is the same in any cross-section.  The second one was discovered by Haites in 1963<ref name=Haites>T. Binnert Heites.

Drilling gives the most detailed information about the position, thickness, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of each layer, but the point is that each well presents all this information in one location on the layer. Because the geometry of a layer can be very complicated it becomes a difficult problem and requires a significant number of drilled wells.\nThe challenge is identifying in each well the interval that belongs to the same layer now or in the past<ref>Voronin, Y.A., Methodological issues of application of mathematical methods and computers in geology.

Nicolas Steno's Dissertation Concerning a Solid Body Enclosed by Process of Nature within a Solid: An English Version with an Introduction and Explanatory Notes. Translated by Winter, John. New York, The Macmillan company; London, Macmillan and company, limited.|pages=229\u2013230</ref>\n# superposition: in undeformed stratigraphic sequences the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the succession,\n# original horizontality: layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally,\n# lateral continuity: layers of sediments initially extend laterally in all directions.\nThe principles 1 allows defining the temporary relations between neighboring geological bodies, the principle 2 organizes the geometrical pattern of the succession of layers, the principle 3 helps uniting the parts of the layer found in separated geological cross-sections.\nPractical correlation has a lot of difficulties: fuzzy borders of the layers, variations in composition and structure of the rocks in the layer, unconformities in the sequence of layers , etc. This is why errors in correlation schemes are not seldom<ref name = Randle></ref>.. When the distances between available cross-sections are decreasing (for example, by drilling new wells) the quality of correlation is improving, but meanwhile the wrong geological decisions could be made that increases the expenses of geological projects. From Steno's principle of initial horizontality follows that the top borders of the layers (tops) were initially flat, and remained flat until the complete succession stays undisturbed by subsequent tectonic movements, but no regularities about the geometric relations between these flat surfaces in the succession were known. The first to shed light on the problem was Canadian geologist Binner Heites: in 1963 he published the Geological Perspective Correlation hypothesis<ref name=Haites></ref>. Perspective geological correlation is a theory that establishes strong geometrical restrictions on the geometry of the layers in sedimentary deposits.\n\n==Perspective geometry in undisturbed succession of layers ==\n[[File:Haites perspective correlation.png|thumb| (B) Heites' perspective correlation]] [[File:W Fig 4.png|thumb|(C) Correlation plot]]\nIn 1963 the Canadian geologist Binner Heites discovered a strong regularity of the layering in [[sedimentary basins]]: the thicknesses of layers within each [[stratigraphic unit]] are governed by the law of  [[perspective (geometry)|perspective correspondence]] <ref name=Haites></ref>. It means that in undisturbed succession on the correlation scheme  the straight lines drawn through the border points of the same layer in two cross-sections intersect in one point \u2013 ''center of perspectivity'' (see B). \nFor geological purposes more convenient geometrical presentation of perspective relations is the correlation plot proposed by Jekhowsky<ref>Jekhowsky, B. de, La methode des distances minimales, nouveau procede quantitative de correlation stratigraphique, exemple d'application on paleontologie. ''Rev. Inst. Fran\u00e7. Du Petrole'', Paris, 1963, vol. XVIII, No. 5, 629\u2013653.</ref> (see C): the depths of the layer's borders in one geologic cross-section are plotted along axis h\u2032 (h1\u2032, h2\u2032, h3\u2032,...), and the position of the same layers in another  cross-section are plotted along axis h\u2032\u2032 (h1\u2032\u2032, h2\u2032\u2032, h3\u2032\u2032, ...). Points 1, 2, 3 \u2026  with coordinates (h1\u2032, h1\u2032\u2032), (h2\u2032, h2\u2032\u2032), and (h3\u2032, h3\u2032\u2032), accordingly, are called ''correlation points'', and a curve drawn through these points, a ''correlation line''. Black dots (''connectors'') represent the relative position of correlated borders on the plot. When the layers geometry satisfies the conditions of perspective correspondence the correlation line is a straight line. In the particular case of parallel layers  the inclination of the ''correlation line'' is 45<sup>0</sup>. \nThe Perspective Geological Correlation also states that \n#each [[sedimentary basin]] consists of a number of [[stratigraphic units]] (sequence of layers without [[unconformities]]) , and\n#in each unit the relations between the thicknesses of the layers in two cross-sections  satisfy the perspective geometry conditions with individual ratios K.\n\nHeites also concludes that all [[strata]] in each unit were governed by the same rate of deposition, and their borders are synchronous time-planes.  Each layer has different thicknesses in different locations, but they lasted equally long. It was a significant input in [[chronostratigraphy]].\n\nThe following are consequences of the basic statements:<br>\n#  In different stratigraphic horizons the slopes of the correlation lines are different.  \n# If two adjacent sections have the same slope then both sections belong to the same stratigraphic horizon.  The gap between the lines indicates a fault.    \n# If on the correlation line that presents the undisturbed stratigraphic succession one correlation point doesn't fit the line it means that<br>a) the correlation of the tops of the corresponding layer is wrong, or<br>       b) lithologic replacement.\n\n== Connections to traditional lithostratigraphy == \nThe Perspective Geological Correlation is well grounded in traditional [[geology]]. The method of convergence maps serves for determining the structure of the layer based on the known structure of the layers lying above. It is based on the assumption that the layers are close to parallel<ref>Hain, B.E., and Lomidze, M.G., 1995, Geotectonica s osnovami geodinamiki ( Geotectonics with basics of geodynamics): Moscow State University, Moscow, 480</ref> Convergence map shows lines of equal distance ([[Isopach map|isopach lines]]) between key layer and target layer<ref>Tearpock, Daniel J. and Bischke, Richard E. (2002), Applied Subsurface Geological Mapping with Structural Methods (2nd Edition), Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs 822 p.</ref>. If the layers are parallel the distance between these layers is constant,  the structures of both layers are identical, and to determine depths of the target horizon it is enough to get only one deep well, which reached the target layer.  But in reality such conditions are extremely rare. In reality restoring the geometry of the target horizon demands a number of deep wells in the area. In this case the standard procedure for calculating the distance between the target layer and key layer ''in any point'' in the area is linear interpolation between the known wells<ref>Yang Q. & Bursik M. A new interpolation method to model thickness, isopachs, extent, and volume of tephra fall deposits. Bulletin of Volcanology volume  78, article number 68 (2016).</ref>. The reliability of the result (the geometrical structure of the target horizon) is estimated by the analysis of the trend of the distances between key horizon and target horizon (isopachs): if the trend is regular, for example, the distances are monotonically changing in one direction, it is a sign of reliability of the reconstruction. In the simplest case the surface of the target horizon is a [[ general position|plain in general position]], and the linear interpolation gives the correct result. The assumptions of the convergence method are consequences of the perspective correlations theory<ref name=Unorthodox></ref>, so, the method obtains the theoretical background. The theory also gave an additional criteria for the validity of the reconstructed surface. It defines the stratigraphic interval where layers were deposited without interruption, and where the layers' thicknesses satisfy the law of [[perspective (geometry)|perspective geometry]].The convergence maps deliver the correct result only when the layers belong to such stratigraphic unit.\n\n== Testing ==\n[[File:One stratigraphic unit.png|thumb|left|(D) Correlation plot for two cross-sections in Innisfail field (Alberta.

B., 1964, Time in Stratigraphy: New York, McGraw-Hill, 365 p. </ref>. The markers on each axis are the observed depths of lowest (FAD) and highest (LAD) occurrences of a specially defined group of fossils([[taxons]]).  The appearances/ disappearances of taxa are regarded as synchronous and used as markers of correlation. When projected on a graph, the corresponding points of two compared profiles form the Line of Correlation (LOC).  Shaw showed that the ideal LOC consists of linear segments (H).  Such conditions occur when the number of collected fossils is big, and one can be sure that the material covers the complete range of fossils appearance, and FADs and LADs can be accurately determined. In the reality, some sampled ranges will be shorter than true ranges, and this can disturb the linearity of the LOC.  \n\nIn every stratigraphic interval correlated ends of the range (FAD or LAD) belong to the same time surface, and in each geological cross-section (well or outcrop) this interval has identical duration but different thickness. It means that accumulation rates (thickness-to-duration ratio = tg \u03b2) are different in different locations. From the fact that the relation of durations of the units and their thicknesses are linear follows that in the limits of the linear section of LOC all strata have the same accumulation rate. \n\nThe reliability and accuracy of Shaw's method have been tested by Edwards<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, L.E.

Guberman proposed a model of the process of [[sedimentation]]<ref name=Unorthodox></ref><ref>Guberman S. Informal analysis in geology and geophysics. Moscow, Nedra, 1986.</ref>According Haites\u2019 theory in the given sedimentary basin in each stratigraphic unit the condition of perspective correspondence are satisfied in any pair of wells<ref name=Haites></ref>.  From this follows that the tops and bases of the layers in this [[stratigraphic unit]] satisfy the conditions of perspective correspondence in 3-D space (K). Any three points of a plane define the complete plane. It means that if in three wells  the thicknesses of layers belonging to the same stratigraphic unit are known, then the thicknesses of these layers can be calculated for any location in the basin. Accordingly, if the structure of the top border of the stratigraphic unit is known, the structure of any other border in this unit can be calculated.\nThe model of creating such sophisticated geometrical pattern is based on the first Steno\u2019s principle: the strata are originally horizontal, i.e. are planes. It occurs in the shallow waters due the torbulence of the undersurface layer of water. The second Steno\u2019s principle , which indicates the creation of a series of sedimentary layers lying on top of each others, supposes the subsidence of the basin. The sinking of the basin follows the strong geometrical restrictions: the tectonic bloc, which carry the basin, is rotating around the straight line parallel to the water surface, and located  onshore (L). As a result until the moment of main tectonic disturbance all borders of the layers remain flat and the geometrical inter-relations are described as perspective correspomdence. In the future the tectonic movements will distort the shape of the layers \u2013 the borders will no more be planes, but in majority of cases the changes are smooth and the perspective relations are maintained.\nThis model allows specifying some geological terms. The Steno's horizontality principle has to state: the top surface of the sediments is horizontal.The conformity is a fundamental notion in stratigraphy. Until now this term is used in two different meanings: a surface between two stratigraphic sequances, and the relationship between two stratigraphic units. Sometimes both were used in the same paragraph (see <ref>Shanmugan G. Origin, Recognition, and Importance of Erosional Unconformities in Sedimentary Basins. (In: Ed. K.L. Kleinspehn, .\u2028C. Paola\u2028. New Perspectives in Basin Analysis.  Springer, 1988.</ref>, page 84).Perspective correlation principle allows to define the notion of conformity: sequence of layers that obey the conditions of geometrical perspective is a unit of conformity. Two neighboring units of conformity are in relation of unconformity.  <br>\n\tHere is an example that shows that the borders of undisturbed stratigraphic unit in the Middle Carboniferous  (Volga-Ural oil province, Russia) initially were plains. In the central part of the area (about 100 km in diameter) were chosen three wells at distances of 10 \u2013 15 km..  The three tops of the stratigraphic unit  in the three wells are points in 3D space with coordinates  x, y, z , where x and y are present the position of the well on the surface (M), and z is the thickness of the stratigraphic unit  in this location. They  determine the top plain of the unit as it was at the time of its creation. The three bases determine the bottom plane of the unit at it was at the same time.  This allowed calculateing the thickness of the stratigraphic unit at any point in the area. Because the area was well enough drilled the calculated numbers can be compared with the real numbers. The average difference equals 2%.\n\n\n{{clearboth}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n\n\n[[Category:Geology]]\n[[Category:Stratigraphy]]\n[[Category:Sediments]]\n[[Category:Sedimentary basins]]\n[[Category:Geometry]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_geological_correlation"}
