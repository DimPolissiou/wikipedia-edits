The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in [[Miami Beach]]. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] in two first-round knockouts, Clay was a 7\u20131 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\", stating \"Liston even smells like a bear\" and claiming \"After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo.\"<ref>[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=vkvoAgAAQBAJ|page=147|text=Liston even smells like a bear}} Remnick (1998), p. 147]</ref> Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54.<ref name=\"Liston\">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lipsyte |title=Clay Wins Title in Seventh-Round Upset As Liston Is Halted by Shoulder Injury |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-upset.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1964 |accessdate=December 27, 2008}}</ref> Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\n\nThe outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, [[Angelo Dundee]], to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves.<ref name=\"Liston\" /> Though unconfirmed, boxing historian [[Bert Sugar]] said that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes \"burning\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Sugar |first=Bert Randolph |title=Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJ2uBBsN0E0C |date=November 1, 2003 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-048-3 |page=196}}</ref><ref>In an interview in 1974, Ali said that, prior to his later fight with Foreman, a one-time member of Liston's entourage offered him a liniment that could be applied to boxing gloves and that would cause a blinding, temporary stinging of the eyes. {{YouTube|nKGdopYDIWU}}</ref>\n\nDespite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by [[Technical knockout|TKO]]. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: \"Eat your words!\" He added, \"I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived.\"<ref>McLeod, Kembrew, ''Pranksters: Making Mischief in the Modern World'', pp. 223\u20134.</ref>\n\nAt ringside post fight, Clay appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Liston had was \"an open eye, a big cut eye!\" When told by Joe Louis that the injury was a \"left arm thrown out of its socket,\" Clay quipped, \"Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't!\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4IKMX-5JLk \"Cassius Clay vs. Sonny Liston - 1964 Boxen\"]. YouTube.</ref>\n\nIn winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, [[Floyd Patterson]] remained the youngest to win the heavyweight championship, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following [[Rocky Marciano]]'s retirement. [[Mike Tyson]] broke both records in 1986 when he defeated [[Trevor Berbick]] to win the heavyweight title at age 20.\n\nSoon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to [[Islam]] and affiliating with the Nation of Islam. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cuddy |first=Jack |title=Clay Undergoes Surgery; Fight Is Off Indefinitely |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9544811/the_bridgeport_telegram/ |newspaper=[[The Bridgeport Telegram]] |date=November 14, 1964 |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=March 14, 2017}} {{free access}}</ref> The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a \"phantom punch\". Referee [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] did not begin the count immediately after the knockdown, as Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Liston rose after he had been down for about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXYwb2C6Hec |title=Muhammad Ali vs Sonny Liston I & II \u2013 Highlights (Ali Becomes World Champion & Phantom Punch Fight!) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref> The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-on-his-50th-ali-is-still-the-greatest.html |work=The New York Times |title=Sports of The Times; On His 50th, Ali Is Still 'The Greatest' |date=January 16, 1992 |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |first1=Dave |last1=Anderson}}</ref>\n\nIt has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he \"took a dive\" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vachss |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Vachss |url=http://www.vachss.com/only_child/index.html |title=Only Child |page=89 |publisher=Vintage |year=2003}} Vachss further explains the way such a fix would have been engineered in {{cite book |url=http://twotrainsrunning.com/ |title=Two Trains Running |pages=160\u2013165, 233 |publisher=Pantheon |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n====Fight against Patterson====\n{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Floyd Patterson}}\n\nAli defended his title against former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an \"[[Uncle Tom syndrome|Uncle Tom]]\", calling him \"The Rabbit\". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his [[Sacroiliac joint|sacroiliac]]. Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight.<ref name=Belth>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/37158310/ |agency=Sports on Earth |title=ALI-PATTERSON: THE REAL STORY |journal=Sports on Earth |date=August 27, 2012 |accessdate=June 3, 2016 |first=Alex |last=Belth}}</ref> Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics. Stratton also cites an interview by [[Howard Cosell]] in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured. Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's. Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the [[IRS]].<ref name=Belth/>\n\n====Main Bout====\nAfter the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and [[pay-per-view]] [[closed-circuit television]] broadcasts. The company's stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, along with several others, including [[Bob Arum]].<ref name=\"Ezra105\">{{cite book |last=Ezra |first=Michael |title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power |date=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781136274756 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&pg=PA105 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ali 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Ali in 1966]]\nAli and then-[[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight champion boxer [[Ernie Terrell]] had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his joining the Nation of Islam). But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, \"I ain't got nothing against no [[Viet Cong]]; no Viet Cong never called me nigger.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Shalit |first=Nevin I. |title=Muhammad Ali: Losing the Real Title |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1980/7/15/muhammad-ali-losing-the-real-title/ |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |date=July 15, 1980 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=He Could Go To Jail And Still Be Champ |date=August 28, 1967 |first1=Angelo |last1=Dundee |first2=Tex |last2=Maule}}</ref>\n\nInstead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against [[George Chuvalo]], [[Henry Cooper]], [[Brian London]] and [[Karl Mildenberger]].\n\nAli returned to the United States to fight [[Cleveland Williams]] in the Houston Astrodome on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and {{convert|10|ft|m|disp=flip}} of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career.\n\nAli fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell, who was unbeaten in five years and had defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced, was billed as Ali's toughest opponent since Liston; he was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali \"Clay\", much to Ali's annoyance. The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. \"I want to torture him\", he said. \"A clean knockout is too good for him.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Tex |last=Maule |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |title=Cruel Ali With All The Skills |date=February 13, 1967 |work=Sports Illustrated |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309201457/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, \"What's my name, Uncle Tom ... what's my name?\" Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye, forcing him to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as \"one of the ugliest boxing fights.\" [[Tex Maule]] later wrote: \"It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.\" Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.\n\nAfter Ali's title defense against [[Zora Folley]] on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service.<ref name=\"greatath\" /> His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed.\n\n===Exile and comeback===\nIn March 1966, Ali [[#Vietnam War and resistance to the draft|refused to be inducted into the armed forces]]. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970\u2014from ages 25 to almost 29\u2014as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. During this time of inactivity, as [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African-American pride and racial justice.\n\n====''The Super Fight''====\n{{Main|The Super Fight}}\nWhile banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1&nbsp;million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano.<ref name=\"Enterprise News Sep 2009\">{{cite news |title=Ali vs. Marciano: Who wins? |url=http://www.enterprisenews.com/article/20090901/News/309019646 |work=The Enterprise |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes.<ref name=\"The Guardian Nov 2012\">{{cite news |title=The forgotten story of ... the Rocky Marciano v Muhammad Ali Super Fight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/13/forgotten-story-rocky-marciano-muhammad-ali |date=November 13, 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters, along with the opinions of approximately 250 boxing experts.

The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion [[Joe Frazier]].\n\n====First fight against Joe Frazier====\n{{Main|Fight of the Century}}\nAli and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \"[[Fight of the Century]]\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it \"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life.\" The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" />\n\nAdding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a \"dumb tool of the white establishment.\" \"Frazier is too ugly to be champ\", Ali said. \"Frazier is too dumb to be champ.\" Ali also frequently called Frazier an \"Uncle Tom\". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, \"Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" />\n\nAli began training at a farm near [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a [[Muhammad Ali's Deer Lake Training Camp|real training camp]] in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, where he trained for all his fights from 1972 to the end of his career in 1981.\n\nThe Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head \"no\" after he was hit. In the later rounds\u2014in what was the first appearance of the \"[[rope-a-dope]] strategy\"\u2014Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee [[Arthur Mercante]] said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds.<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" /> Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.\n\n====Chamberlain challenge and Ellis fight====\n{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Jimmy Ellis}}\nIn 1971, basketball star [[Wilt Chamberlain]] challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven-foot-two-inch tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali\u2014weighing 60{{nbsp}}pounds more and able to reach 14{{nbsp}}inches further\u2014Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom [[Los Angeles Lakers]] owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\",<ref>{{cite news |title=Ali's Remark Ended Wilt's Ring Career |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-15/sports/sp-979_1_wilt-s-ring-career |accessdate= |at=Morning Briefing |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 1989}}</ref> and he did exactly that.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Terry |title=Achilles Heel Advertising: Repositioning the Competition |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/achilles-heel-advertising-repositioning-the-competition-1.3473631 |accessdate=August 30, 2018 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> To replace Ali's opponent, promoter [[Bob Arum]] quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]], who was a childhood friend from [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to fight him.\n\n====Fights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster and Norton====\nAfter the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, [[Ken Norton]] broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After initially considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.\n\n====Second fight against Joe Frazier====\n{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II}}\nAli was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.\n\n===World heavyweight champion (second reign)===\n====''The Rumble in the Jungle''====\n{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion [[George Foreman]] in Kinshasa, [[Zaire]], on October 30, 1974\u2014a bout nicknamed ''[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]''. Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Ken Norton]], who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\n\n[[File:WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING CHAMPION MUHAMMAD ALI, A BLACK MUSLIM, ATTENDS THE SECT'S SERVICE TO HEAR ELIJAH MUHAMMAD... - NARA - 556247.jpg|thumb|Ali in 1974]]\nAs usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight.

Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the \"[[Rope-a-dope]]\", so violated conventional boxing wisdom\u2014letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will\u2014that at ringside writer [[George Plimpton]] thought the fight had to be fixed.<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" /> Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: \"I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?'

The bout, known as the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\", was held on October 1, 1975,<ref name=\"greatath\" /> in temperatures approaching {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called \"target practice\" on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent.\n\nAn ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight \"was the closest thing to dying that I know\", and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, \"Why would I want to go back and see Hell?\" After the fight he cited Frazier as \"the greatest fighter of all times next to me.\"\n\nAfter the third fight with Frazier, Ali considered retirement. He said, \u201cI\u2019m sore all over. My arms, my face, my sides all ache. I\u2019m so, so tired. There is a great possibility that I will retire. You might have seen the last of me.

The bout, which was held at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], resulted in Ali winning a heavily contested decision that was loudly booed by the audience.

Ali won the fight by another unanimous decision, but the bout caused his longtime doctor [[Ferdie Pacheco]] to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, \"the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough.\"<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" />\n\nIn February 1978, Ali faced [[Leon Spinks]] at the Hilton Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight, and was seriously out of shape by the opening bell. He lost the title by split decision. A rematch occurred in September at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] in New Orleans, Louisiana. 70,000 people attended the bout and paid a total of $6&nbsp;million admission, making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time.<ref name=\"Times-Picayune, New Orleans, Peter Finney's column from 1978\">[http://www.nola.com/sports/index.ssf/2016/06/read_peter_finneys_column_from.html Read Peter Finney's column on Ali vs. Spinks 2 at the Superdome in 1978], ''The Times-Picayune'' NOLA.com (New Orleans, LA.), re-posted on June 4, 2016.</ref> Ali won a unanimous decision in an uninspiring fight, with referee Lucien Joubert scoring rounds 10-4, judge Ernie Cojoe 10-4, and judge Herman Preis 11-4.

His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face [[Larry Holmes]] for the WBC belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali's need for money. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, \"Larry didn't want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror.\"\n\nIt was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/21/us/muhammad-ali---fast-facts/ |title=Muhammad Ali Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref> The [[Nevada Athletic Commission]] (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again.

As public opinion began turning people against the war and the Civil Rights Movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country; this itinerary was rare if not unprecedented for a prizefighter. At [[Howard University]], for example, he gave his popular \"Black Is Best\" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor [[Nathan Hare]] on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"The Greatest\" Is Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919377-5,00.html |page=5 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 27, 1978 |accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[Clay v.

[[Al Sharpton]] spoke of his bravery at a time when there was still widespread support for the Vietnam War. \"For the heavyweight champion of the world, who had achieved the highest level of athletic celebrity, to put all of that on the line\u2014the money, the ability to get endorsements\u2014to sacrifice all of that for a cause, gave a whole sense of legitimacy to the movement and the causes with young people that nothing else could have done.

The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in [[Miami Beach]]. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] in two first-round knockouts, Clay was a 7\u20131 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\", stating \"Liston even smells like a bear\" and claiming \"After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo.\"<ref>[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=vkvoAgAAQBAJ|page=147|text=Liston even smells like a bear}} Remnick (1998), p. 147]</ref> Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54.<ref name=\"Liston\">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lipsyte |title=Clay Wins Title in Seventh-Round Upset As Liston Is Halted by Shoulder Injury |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-upset.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1964 |accessdate=December 27, 2008}}</ref> Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\n\nThe outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, [[Angelo Dundee]], to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves.<ref name=\"Liston\" /> Though unconfirmed, boxing historian [[Bert Sugar]] said that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes \"burning\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Sugar |first=Bert Randolph |title=Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJ2uBBsN0E0C |date=November 1, 2003 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-048-3 |page=196}}</ref><ref>In an interview in 1974, Ali said that, prior to his later fight with Foreman, a one-time member of Liston's entourage offered him a liniment that could be applied to boxing gloves and that would cause a blinding, temporary stinging of the eyes. {{YouTube|nKGdopYDIWU}}</ref>\n\nDespite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by [[Technical knockout|TKO]]. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: \"Eat your words!\" He added, \"I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived.\"<ref>McLeod, Kembrew, ''Pranksters: Making Mischief in the Modern World'', pp. 223\u20134.</ref>\n\nAt ringside post fight, Clay appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Liston had was \"an open eye, a big cut eye!\" When told by Joe Louis that the injury was a \"left arm thrown out of its socket,\" Clay quipped, \"Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't!\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4IKMX-5JLk \"Cassius Clay vs. Sonny Liston - 1964 Boxen\"]. YouTube.</ref>\n\nIn winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, [[Floyd Patterson]] remained the youngest to win the heavyweight championship, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following [[Rocky Marciano]]'s retirement. [[Mike Tyson]] broke both records in 1986 when he defeated [[Trevor Berbick]] to win the heavyweight title at age 20.\n\nSoon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to [[Islam]] and affiliating with the Nation of Islam. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cuddy |first=Jack |title=Clay Undergoes Surgery; Fight Is Off Indefinitely |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9544811/the_bridgeport_telegram/ |newspaper=[[The Bridgeport Telegram]] |date=November 14, 1964 |page=1 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=March 14, 2017}} {{free access}}</ref> The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a \"phantom punch\". Referee [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] did not begin the count immediately after the knockdown, as Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Liston rose after he had been down for about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXYwb2C6Hec |title=Muhammad Ali vs Sonny Liston I & II \u2013 Highlights (Ali Becomes World Champion & Phantom Punch Fight!) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref> The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-on-his-50th-ali-is-still-the-greatest.html |work=The New York Times |title=Sports of The Times; On His 50th, Ali Is Still 'The Greatest' |date=January 16, 1992 |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |first1=Dave |last1=Anderson}}</ref>\n\nIt has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he \"took a dive\" to pay off debts.

Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an \"[[Uncle Tom syndrome|Uncle Tom]]\", calling him \"The Rabbit\". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his [[Sacroiliac joint|sacroiliac]].

K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics. Stratton also cites an interview by [[Howard Cosell]] in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured. Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's. Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the [[IRS]].<ref name=Belth/>\n\n====Main Bout====\nAfter the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and [[pay-per-view]] [[closed-circuit television]] broadcasts.

But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, \"I ain't got nothing against no [[Viet Cong]]; no Viet Cong never called me nigger.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Shalit |first=Nevin I. |title=Muhammad Ali: Losing the Real Title |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1980/7/15/muhammad-ali-losing-the-real-title/ |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |date=July 15, 1980 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=He Could Go To Jail And Still Be Champ |date=August 28, 1967 |first1=Angelo |last1=Dundee |first2=Tex |last2=Maule}}</ref>\n\nInstead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against [[George Chuvalo]], [[Henry Cooper]], [[Brian London]] and [[Karl Mildenberger]].\n\nAli returned to the United States to fight [[Cleveland Williams]] in the Houston Astrodome on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and {{convert|10|ft|m|disp=flip}} of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career.\n\nAli fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell, who was unbeaten in five years and had defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced, was billed as Ali's toughest opponent since Liston; he was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali \"Clay\", much to Ali's annoyance. The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. \"I want to torture him\", he said. \"A clean knockout is too good for him.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Tex |last=Maule |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |title=Cruel Ali With All The Skills |date=February 13, 1967 |work=Sports Illustrated |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309201457/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, \"What's my name, Uncle Tom ... what's my name?\" Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye, forcing him to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as \"one of the ugliest boxing fights.\" [[Tex Maule]] later wrote: \"It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.\" Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.\n\nAfter Ali's title defense against [[Zora Folley]] on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service.<ref name=\"greatath\" /> His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed.\n\n===Exile and comeback===\nIn March 1966, Ali [[#Vietnam War and resistance to the draft|refused to be inducted into the armed forces]]. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970\u2014from ages 25 to almost 29\u2014as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. During this time of inactivity, as [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African-American pride and racial justice.\n\n====''The Super Fight''====\n{{Main|The Super Fight}}\nWhile banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1&nbsp;million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano.<ref name=\"Enterprise News Sep 2009\">{{cite news |title=Ali vs. Marciano: Who wins? |url=http://www.enterprisenews.com/article/20090901/News/309019646 |work=The Enterprise |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes.<ref name=\"The Guardian Nov 2012\">{{cite news |title=The forgotten story of ... the Rocky Marciano v Muhammad Ali Super Fight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/13/forgotten-story-rocky-marciano-muhammad-ali |date=November 13, 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters, along with the opinions of approximately 250 boxing experts.

The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion [[Joe Frazier]].\n\n====First fight against Joe Frazier====\n{{Main|Fight of the Century}}\nAli and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \"[[Fight of the Century]]\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it \"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life.\" The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" />\n\nAdding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a \"dumb tool of the white establishment.\" \"Frazier is too ugly to be champ\", Ali said. \"Frazier is too dumb to be champ.\" Ali also frequently called Frazier an \"Uncle Tom\". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, \"Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" />\n\nAli began training at a farm near [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a [[Muhammad Ali's Deer Lake Training Camp|real training camp]] in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, where he trained for all his fights from 1972 to the end of his career in 1981.\n\nThe Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head \"no\" after he was hit. In the later rounds\u2014in what was the first appearance of the \"[[rope-a-dope]] strategy\"\u2014Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee [[Arthur Mercante]] said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds.<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" /> Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.\n\n====Chamberlain challenge and Ellis fight====\n{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Jimmy Ellis}}\nIn 1971, basketball star [[Wilt Chamberlain]] challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven-foot-two-inch tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali\u2014weighing 60{{nbsp}}pounds more and able to reach 14{{nbsp}}inches further\u2014Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom [[Los Angeles Lakers]] owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\",<ref>{{cite news |title=Ali's Remark Ended Wilt's Ring Career |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-15/sports/sp-979_1_wilt-s-ring-career |accessdate= |at=Morning Briefing |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 1989}}</ref> and he did exactly that.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Terry |title=Achilles Heel Advertising: Repositioning the Competition |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/achilles-heel-advertising-repositioning-the-competition-1.3473631 |accessdate=August 30, 2018 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> To replace Ali's opponent, promoter [[Bob Arum]] quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]], who was a childhood friend from [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to fight him.\n\n====Fights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster and Norton====\nAfter the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, [[Ken Norton]] broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After initially considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.\n\n====Second fight against Joe Frazier====\n{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II}}\nAli was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.\n\n===World heavyweight champion (second reign)===\n====''The Rumble in the Jungle''====\n{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion [[George Foreman]] in Kinshasa, [[Zaire]], on October 30, 1974\u2014a bout nicknamed ''[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]''. Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Ken Norton]], who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\n\n[[File:WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING CHAMPION MUHAMMAD ALI, A BLACK MUSLIM, ATTENDS THE SECT'S SERVICE TO HEAR ELIJAH MUHAMMAD... - NARA - 556247.jpg|thumb|Ali in 1974]]\nAs usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer [[David Frost]], \"If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait 'til I whup Foreman's behind!\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGHpXt_hMc |title=Muhammad Ali \u2013 The Rumble In The Jungle(Interview) |publisher=YouTube |date=March 22, 1967 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> He told the press, \"I've done something new for this fight.

Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the \"[[Rope-a-dope]]\", so violated conventional boxing wisdom\u2014letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will\u2014that at ringside writer [[George Plimpton]] thought the fight had to be fixed.<ref name=\"Hauser 2004\" /> Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: \"I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Foreman |first=George |url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/sport/george-foreman-on-ali |title=George Foreman on why Muhammad Ali was so much more than a 'boxer' |magazine=[[ShortList]] |date=January 2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Muhammad Ali and Jimmy Carter.jpg|thumb|President [[Jimmy Carter]] greets Ali at a White House dinner, 1977.]]\n\nIt was a major [[Upset (competition)|upset]] victory,<ref name=\"Herald\">{{cite news |title=Zaire's fight promotion opens new gold mines |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/28336306/ |work=[[The Morning Herald]] |date=November 18, 1974}}</ref> after Ali came in as a 4{{ndash}}1 [[underdog]] against the previously unbeaten, heavy-hitting Foreman.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ali Regains Title, Flooring Foreman |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1030.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 30, 1974}}</ref> The fight became famous for Ali's introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/29/rumble-in-the-jungle-muhammad-ali-george-foreman-book-extract |title=Rumble in the Jungle: the night Ali became King of the World again |date=October 29, 2014 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=October 29, 2014}}</ref> The fight was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1{{nbsp}}billion viewers worldwide.<ref name=\"usatoday\" /><ref name=\"jet\">{{cite journal |title=Mike Tyson May Fight George Foreman In Biggest Money Match: $80 Million |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=September 18, 1995 |volume=88 |issue=19 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA46 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref> It was the world's [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|most-watched live television broadcast]] at the time.<ref name=\"inquisitr\">{{cite news |title=Most-Watched Live TV Broadcasts Of All Time: Where Will The Royal Wedding Rank? |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/4903566/most-watched-live-tv-broadcasts-of-all-time-where-will-the-royal-wedding-rank/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180520042513/http://www.inquisitr.com/4903566/most-watched-live-tv-broadcasts-of-all-time-where-will-the-royal-wedding-rank/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 20, 2018 |accessdate=May 20, 2018 |work=[[Inquisitr]] |date=May 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Fights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner====\nAli's next opponents included [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Ron Lyle]], and [[Joe Bugner]].

The bout, known as the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\", was held on October 1, 1975,<ref name=\"greatath\" /> in temperatures approaching {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called \"target practice\" on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent.\n\nAn ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight \"was the closest thing to dying that I know\", and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, \"Why would I want to go back and see Hell?\" After the fight he cited Frazier as \"the greatest fighter of all times next to me.\"\n\nAfter the third fight with Frazier, Ali considered retirement. He said, \u201cI\u2019m sore all over. My arms, my face, my sides all ache. I\u2019m so, so tired. There is a great possibility that I will retire. You might have seen the last of me.

He was a member of the Port Adelaide side which won the premiership in 2004. On 3 July 2013, he retired from [[Australian Football League|AFL]] football due to a troublesome knee. Cornes is currently serving as a forward development coach for the [https://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/club/staff Port Adelaide Football Club].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Port Adelaide career (1999\u20132011)===\n\n====Early career (1999\u20132003)====\nCornes began his AFL career as a key-forward and after playing only 6 games in 1999, was a regular in the Power forward line in 2000, booting 22 goals. Between 2000 and 2003 Cornes and Tredrea formed one of the best forward partnerships in the AFL, with Chad playing up the ground demonstrating his great contested marking ability. Despite being one of the best forwards in the game, Cornes was moved into defence at the start of the 2004 season.\n\n====Career change (2004\u20132005)====\nIn 2004, Cornes was moved to centre-half back. The new position worked wonders as Cornes began to single-handedly dominate games, earning himself his first [[All-Australian]] award, and finishing third in the [[Brownlow medal]]. The move to centre-half back was a key reason for Port Adelaide's dominance, which culminated in their first Premiership in 2004, defeating the [[Brisbane Lions]] by 40 points. He had a key defensive role on Brisbane Lions' forward [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] during the Grand Final, restricting him to just one behind for the match.\n\nAfter Port Adelaide's dominance in 2004, Cornes was again used as a key defender to great effect. However, Port Adelaide was unable to repeat its finals' glory of 2004, being eliminated by cross town rivals [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]] in the first semi-final.\n\n====Leadership (2006\u20132007)====\nThe 2006 was a disappointing one for Port Adelaide, and one which frustrated Cornes in particular. The season never really took off, and with Cornes now being a senior player, he was moved into the midfield to help the younger players. This move paid off as he dominated matches, which was a huge positive for the Power in an otherwise disappointing campaign. Cornes won the [[Showdown Medal]] in round 21.<ref>[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/6038/Default.aspx?newsId=31309 Cornes can't wait for 2007]</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Cornes was a key midfielder and has a largely impressive season. Cornes finished the 2007 season with 643 disposals, and led the competition in kicks, and went into the Brownlow medal count as one of the favourites. The great form of Cornes in midfield was crucial to the side making the AFL Grand Final, which was a huge surprise to most, including Cornes. Despite not expecting to have a good season, when they did make the Grand Final the belief appeared to be strong but they were unable to win their second flag, going down to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] by a record 119 points\n\n====Injuries (2008\u20132010)====\nPort looked to bounce back from their Grand Final humiliation of the previous year when they took on Geelong in the opening round of 2008. Despite being close throughout the match, they were unable to win and that was the start of a four-game losing streak for the Power. Cornes suffered a broken finger in Round 6 against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] but returned just three weeks later despite the nature of the break being very severe. After 2 years with on and off form, Cornes broke his finger again in mid-2010.\n\n====End of Port Adelaide career (2011)====\nDespite having to stay on the sidelines for the rest of the year, he played on in 2011. In August 2011 he announced that he would be retiring from the AFL after the following week's match against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].<ref>[http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/chad-cornes-retires-132587 Chad Cornes retires] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910060256/http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/chad-cornes-retires-132587 |date=10 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Greater Western Sydney career (2012\u20132013)===\nCornes came out of retirement, and was traded to the Giants during the 2011 October Trade Week. He was a playing assistant coach. On 3 July 2013 Cornes retired from [[Australian Football League|AFL]] football.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===Greater Western Sydney (2013\u20132015)===\nPost retirement, Chad Cornes remained with [[GWS Giants|GWS]] in a full-time coaching role with their backlines, a position he held from 2013 to 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwsgiants.com.au/football/giants-coaching-staff/chad-cornes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909190325/http://www.gwsgiants.com.au/football/giants-coaching-staff/chad-cornes |archivedate=9 September 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Port Adelaide===\nOn 21 September 2015, Cornes was announced as the [[SANFL]] coach of the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]].<ref>http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-21/cornes-returns-to-port-adelaide-as-sanfl-coach</ref> He was elevated to a forward development coach with the Power at the end of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/teams/coaches/chad-cornes|title=Chad Cornes|website=portadelaidefc.com.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn addition to his brother [[Kane Cornes]], his father, [[Graham Cornes]], is also a former VFL/SANFL footballer, playing 317 games for [[Glenelg Football Club|Glenelg]] with a career spanning from 1967 to 1982. Graham also coached various AFL/SANFL teams between 1983 and 1994. His stepmother [[Nicole Cornes]] was a 2007 Labor candidate.

Despite not expecting to have a good season, when they did make the Grand Final the belief appeared to be strong but they were unable to win their second flag, going down to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] by a record 119 points\n\n====Injuries (2008\u20132010)====\nPort looked to bounce back from their Grand Final humiliation of the previous year when they took on Geelong in the opening round of 2008. Despite being close throughout the match, they were unable to win and that was the start of a four-game losing streak for the Power. Cornes suffered a broken finger in Round 6 against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] but returned just three weeks later despite the nature of the break being very severe. After 2 years with on and off form, Cornes broke his finger again in mid-2010.\n\n====End of Port Adelaide career (2011)====\nDespite having to stay on the sidelines for the rest of the year, he played on in 2011. In August 2011 he announced that he would be retiring from the AFL after the following week's match against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].<ref>[http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/chad-cornes-retires-132587 Chad Cornes retires] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910060256/http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/chad-cornes-retires-132587 |date=10 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Greater Western Sydney career (2012\u20132013)===\nCornes came out of retirement, and was traded to the Giants during the 2011 October Trade Week.
