Menace]]'' as a bumbling, foolish [[Gungan]] from the planet [[Naboo]] who is banished by his tribe as punishment for his clumsiness. He is nearly killed by a [[Trade Federation]] transport, only to be saved at the last minute by [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]). Qui-Gon and his [[Jedi Padawan|padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Ewan McGregor]]), persuade Jar Jar's tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. He later goes with the Jedi and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] ([[Natalie Portman]]) to the planet [[Tatooine]], where he meets and befriends nine-year-old slave [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]).\n\nJar Jar later appears in the film's climactic battle scene, where he leads his fellow Gungans, as a general in the Gungan army, in defeating the Trade Federation. After the battle, he appears at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and in the ending parade with his fellow Gungans.\n\n====''Attack of the Clones''====\nJar Jar's role in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' is much smaller, but his actions are significant. Ten years after helping to save his planet, he is a delegate to the [[Galactic Senate]] and as such, plays a role in bringing his old friends, Obi-Wan and Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]) back to [[Coruscant]], where he greets them with enthusiasm. Later, on the behalf of the Naboo, he gives a speech to the assembled Senate in favor of granting [[Palpatine|Chancellor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) vast [[emergency powers]]. \n\n====''Revenge of the Sith''====\nJar Jar appears in only a few scenes in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', and has no dialogue (besides a brief \"'scuse me\" at one point). He was originally given some dialogue in the beginning, but this was cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html|title=Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith Script|work=IMSDb|accessdate=March 17, 2013|last=Lucas|first=George}}</ref> Another cut scene would have shown Palpatine mocking Jar Jar for putting him in power before crowning himself emperor.<ref name=End>{{cite web|url=http://www.forcematerial.com/home/2017/2/20/how-was-george-lucas-going-to-end-jar-jars-story|title=How was George Lucas going to end Jar Jar's story?|author=Rohan Williams|publisher=Force Material|date=July 14, 1999|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref> He is most prominently featured in Padm\u00e9 Amidala's funeral procession at the end of the film, marching sadly behind her coffin alongside [[Boss Nass]].\n\n===''The Clone Wars'' television series ===\nJar Jar Binks is a supporting character in the animated series ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'', once again voiced by Best, although BJ Hughes voiced the character in three season one episodes.

Menace]]'' as a bumbling, foolish [[Gungan]] from the planet [[Naboo]] who is banished by his tribe as punishment for his clumsiness. He is nearly killed by a [[Trade Federation]] transport, only to be saved at the last minute by [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]). Qui-Gon and his [[Jedi Padawan|padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Ewan McGregor]]), persuade Jar Jar's tribe to release him to their custody as a guide. He later goes with the Jedi and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] ([[Natalie Portman]]) to the planet [[Tatooine]], where he meets and befriends nine-year-old slave [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]).\n\nJar Jar later appears in the film's climactic battle scene, where he leads his fellow Gungans, as a general in the Gungan army, in defeating the Trade Federation. After the battle, he appears at the funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn and in the ending parade with his fellow Gungans.\n\n====''Attack of the Clones''====\nJar Jar's role in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' is much smaller, but his actions are significant. Ten years after helping to save his planet, he is a delegate to the [[Galactic Senate]] and as such, plays a role in bringing his old friends, Obi-Wan and Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]) back to [[Coruscant]], where he greets them with enthusiasm. Later, on the behalf of the Naboo, he gives a speech to the assembled Senate in favor of granting [[Palpatine|Chancellor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) vast [[emergency powers]]. \n\n====''Revenge of the Sith''====\nJar Jar appears in only a few scenes in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', and has no dialogue (besides a brief \"'scuse me\" at one point).

To cover up the affair, she took one twin, Chenxi, while Song took the other, Yazai, and moved away to Malaysia. Song Yazai is a fisherman who lives a contented life without ambition for fame or fortune.

They are members of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] and compete in [[Scottish League One|League One]], the third tier of the [[Scottish football league system]].\n\nThe club were the first to win the [[Scottish League Cup]] three times and the first of only two sides from the second tier of the [[Scottish football pyramid|Scottish league system]] to win the [[Scottish Cup]]. This makes them the most successful club in Fife in terms of major honours won.\n\nEast Fife are one of four SPFL clubs based in Fife, but are the only one to bear the name of the area. The three others are [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]], [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and the [[Kirkcaldy]]-based [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], all of whom have historically [[Fife derby|shared rivalries]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\nLocal demand for the establishment of a senior football team led to a public meeting being held in January 1903 and resulted in the formation of East Fife Football Club. After spending its first season competing in the Fife League and the [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]], as well as playing in a number of challenge matches, the club joined the [[Eastern Football League (Scotland)|Eastern League]] for [[1904\u201305 in Scottish football|season 1904\u201305]]. The following season East Fife joined the [[Northern Football League (Scotland)|Northern League]], which included clubs such as [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]]. The club remained in the Northern League until the [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|1908\u201309 season]]. In 1909, East Fife joined the [[Central Football League|Central League]], which consisted of many of the teams who had played in the Northern League, with the addition of [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]], [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] and [[King's Park F.C.|King's Park]] from [[Stirling]].\n\n=== 1920s and 30s ===\nEast Fife remained in the Central League until 1921, apart from a period during the [[World War I|First World War]] when the Eastern League was reformed. In the period following the war, the clubs competing for the Central League were mainly from the [[coal]] and [[shale]] mining communities of [[Fife]] and [[West Lothian]]. As the mining towns thrived with the growth of the [[mining industry]] and its associated influx of miners and their families, so did the local football clubs. The result of this was that by the end of the decade, the Central League clubs could afford to pay their players higher wages than they would receive in the [[Scottish Football League]]. In an effort to stop the migration of its players to the Central League, the Scottish League decided to admit the Central League clubs, including East Fife, to its membership. The Central League therefore became the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] at the start of the [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322 season]].\n\nOnly six years after becoming members of the Scottish League, East Fife appeared in the 1927 [[Scottish Cup]] final, which it lost 3\u20131 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Hampden Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1927-04-16%3A+Celtic+3-1+East+Fife%2C+Scottish+Cup+Final|publisher=The Celtic Wiki|title=Celtic 2\u20131 East Fife, Scottish Cup (newspaper report scans)|date=16 April 1927|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nEast Fife's only season in Scottish football's top division before [[World War II]] was [[1930\u201331 in Scottish football|1930\u201331]] after finishing Second Division runners-up the year before.\n\nThe 1927 cup feat was surpassed just over a decade later when \"The Fifers\" won the [[1937\u201338 Scottish Cup]]. The prestigious cup was secured with a 4\u20132 win over [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the final. The game was watched by a crowd of almost 92,000 spectators.\n\n=== Golden age ===\nEast Fife's best years were undoubtedly in the decade following the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In [[1946\u201347 in Scottish football|1946\u201347]] (the first season after the war) the club finished third missing promotion by one place. [[Scot Symon]] joined as manager in 1947. At the end of ([[1947\u201348 in Scottish football|1947\u201348]]) East Fife were promoted to the top flight of Scottish football as 'B' Division champions.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby>[http://qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1033 Bobby Black profile on \"Queens Legends\" on the official Queen of the South FC website]</ref>\n\nDuring this \"Golden Period\", the club won the [[Scottish League Cup]] on three separate occasions (1947\u201348, [[1949\u201350 in Scottish football|1949\u201350]], and [[1953\u201354 in Scottish football|1953\u201354]]) in seven seasons. A third Scottish Cup final appearance was added to its achievements list in 1949\u201350.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby />\n\nThe club's league record was also impressive. In the six seasons between 1948 and 1954, East Fife finished its [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] (then the pinnacle of Scottish football) campaign in fourth, fourth, tenth, third, third and sixth respectively.<ref>[http://www.eastfife-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadlghs.asp League History \u2013 East Fife FC \u2013 C'MON THE FIFE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In one of these seasons, [[1952\u201353 in Scottish football|1952\u201353]], East Fife were still in the running for the league title with only a few games remaining.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby />\n\nAmong players who played at the club for at least part of this era were [[Tommy Adams (footballer)|Tommy Adams]] and [[Willie Laird]] \u2013 both had played in the Scottish Cup-winning side before the war. Others joined club and would go on to represent Scotland while at the club \u2013 [[George Aitken (footballer born 1925)|George Aitken]], [[Davie Duncan]], [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]], [[Henry Morris (footballer)|Henry Morris]], [[Charlie Fleming]] and [[Andy Matthew]]. Others such as [[Jimmy Philp]] and winger and later Scottish League cap [[Bobby Black (footballer)|Bobby Black]] were among those who picked up cup winners medals at the club.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby /> [[Harold Davis (footballer)|Harold Davis]] was on the books for a number of seasons but rarely played. This was due to Davis fulfilling his national service in the [[Korean War]] in which he was seriously injured in combat. Davis took two years to recover from his injuries. He then played a couple of games for the first team before following Symon to Rangers.\n\nEast Fife spent ten successive seasons in Scotland's top league. Away from this period the club have spent only four other seasons playing in Scotland's top division.\n\n=== Late 20th century ===\nEast Fife were relegated from Scotland's top division at the end of [[1957\u201358 in Scottish football|season 1957\u201358]]. Since then, the Methil outfit has struggled to match previous success. This is emphasised by the fact that aside from three seasons during the early 1970s, the club has played all of its football outside the top league since the 1950s.\n\nIn November 1998, East Fife moved to a purpose built stadium near [[Methil power station]].\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe [[2006\u201307 in Scottish football|2006\u201307 season]] saw East Fife begin the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Scottish Third Division]] campaign impressively, at one point amassing a commanding nine point lead over their nearest rivals. The Fifer's form declined markedly but recovered to qualify for the newly implemented promotion play-offs. East Fife beat [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] outfit [[Stranraer F.C.|Stranraer]] 4\u20132 on aggregate before losing 7\u20132 to [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] on aggregate in the final. [[2007\u201308 in Scottish football|Season 2007\u201308]] commenced with high expectations for The Fifers amidst a flurry of preseason signings.<ref>{{cite news | title=East Fife add five more to squad  | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/east_fife/6748259.stm | publisher= BBC Sport | accessdate=2007-12-16| date=2007-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=All to play for in the Third | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/6927898.stm | publisher= BBC Sport | accessdate=2007-12-16| date=2007-08-02}}</ref> The new acquisitions proved successful as the team thoroughly dominated the early stages, culminating in a twelve-point lead at the top of the division by Christmas.

This gave them a points total of 74, 26 points ahead of Stranraer. This was East Fife's first league title for 60 years and their first piece of silverware since 1954.\n\nOn 14 April 2009 their manager [[David Baikie]] resigned from his position.<ref>{{cite web | title=Baikie resigns as East Fife manager | url=http://www.eastfife.org/news_detail.php?news_id=333 | publisher=East Fife Football Club | accessdate=2009-04-14 | date=2009-04-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130735/http://www.eastfife.org/news_detail.php?news_id=333 | archive-date=19 July 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn 23 August 2011, the Fifers delivered an emphatic victory against [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] of the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] in the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | title=East Fife 2\u20131 Dunfermline | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14539064.stm | publisher= BBC Sport | accessdate=2011-09-21| date=2011-08-23}}</ref> Then on 20 September 2011, East Fife recorded yet another cup shock, defeating SPL [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 7\u20136 on penalties, after a 3\u20133 draw, at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]], to advance to the quarter finals of the Scottish League Cup.<ref>{{cite web | title=Aberdeen 3\u20133 East Fife (3\u20134 pens) | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14893530.stm | publisher= BBC Sport | accessdate=2011-09-21| date=2011-09-20}}</ref> \n\nEast Fife remained in the Second Division for six seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2013\u201314 season after defeat in the  relegation playoff final, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to Stirling Albion.

They are members of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] and compete in [[Scottish League One|League One]], the third tier of the [[Scottish football league system]].\n\nThe club were the first to win the [[Scottish League Cup]] three times and the first of only two sides from the second tier of the [[Scottish football pyramid|Scottish league system]] to win the [[Scottish Cup]]. This makes them the most successful club in Fife in terms of major honours won.\n\nEast Fife are one of four SPFL clubs based in Fife, but are the only one to bear the name of the area. The three others are [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]], [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and the [[Kirkcaldy]]-based [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], all of whom have historically [[Fife derby|shared rivalries]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\nLocal demand for the establishment of a senior football team led to a public meeting being held in January 1903 and resulted in the formation of East Fife Football Club. After spending its first season competing in the Fife League and the [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]], as well as playing in a number of challenge matches, the club joined the [[Eastern Football League (Scotland)|Eastern League]] for [[1904\u201305 in Scottish football|season 1904\u201305]]. The following season East Fife joined the [[Northern Football League (Scotland)|Northern League]], which included clubs such as [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]]. The club remained in the Northern League until the [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|1908\u201309 season]]. In 1909, East Fife joined the [[Central Football League|Central League]], which consisted of many of the teams who had played in the Northern League, with the addition of [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]], [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] and [[King's Park F.C.|King's Park]] from [[Stirling]].\n\n=== 1920s and 30s ===\nEast Fife remained in the Central League until 1921, apart from a period during the [[World War I|First World War]] when the Eastern League was reformed. In the period following the war, the clubs competing for the Central League were mainly from the [[coal]] and [[shale]] mining communities of [[Fife]] and [[West Lothian]]. As the mining towns thrived with the growth of the [[mining industry]] and its associated influx of miners and their families, so did the local football clubs. The result of this was that by the end of the decade, the Central League clubs could afford to pay their players higher wages than they would receive in the [[Scottish Football League]]. In an effort to stop the migration of its players to the Central League, the Scottish League decided to admit the Central League clubs, including East Fife, to its membership. The Central League therefore became the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] at the start of the [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322 season]].\n\nOnly six years after becoming members of the Scottish League, East Fife appeared in the 1927 [[Scottish Cup]] final, which it lost 3\u20131 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Hampden Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1927-04-16%3A+Celtic+3-1+East+Fife%2C+Scottish+Cup+Final|publisher=The Celtic Wiki|title=Celtic 2\u20131 East Fife, Scottish Cup (newspaper report scans)|date=16 April 1927|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nEast Fife's only season in Scottish football's top division before [[World War II]] was [[1930\u201331 in Scottish football|1930\u201331]] after finishing Second Division runners-up the year before.\n\nThe 1927 cup feat was surpassed just over a decade later when \"The Fifers\" won the [[1937\u201338 Scottish Cup]]. The prestigious cup was secured with a 4\u20132 win over [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] in the final. The game was watched by a crowd of almost 92,000 spectators.\n\n=== Golden age ===\nEast Fife's best years were undoubtedly in the decade following the [[World War II|Second World War]]. In [[1946\u201347 in Scottish football|1946\u201347]] (the first season after the war) the club finished third missing promotion by one place. [[Scot Symon]] joined as manager in 1947. At the end of ([[1947\u201348 in Scottish football|1947\u201348]]) East Fife were promoted to the top flight of Scottish football as 'B' Division champions.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby>[http://qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1033 Bobby Black profile on \"Queens Legends\" on the official Queen of the South FC website]</ref>\n\nDuring this \"Golden Period\", the club won the [[Scottish League Cup]] on three separate occasions (1947\u201348, [[1949\u201350 in Scottish football|1949\u201350]], and [[1953\u201354 in Scottish football|1953\u201354]]) in seven seasons. A third Scottish Cup final appearance was added to its achievements list in 1949\u201350.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby />\n\nThe club's league record was also impressive. In the six seasons between 1948 and 1954, East Fife finished its [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] (then the pinnacle of Scottish football) campaign in fourth, fourth, tenth, third, third and sixth respectively.<ref>[http://www.eastfife-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadlghs.asp League History \u2013 East Fife FC \u2013 C'MON THE FIFE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In one of these seasons, [[1952\u201353 in Scottish football|1952\u201353]], East Fife were still in the running for the league title with only a few games remaining.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby />\n\nAmong players who played at the club for at least part of this era were [[Tommy Adams (footballer)|Tommy Adams]] and [[Willie Laird]] \u2013 both had played in the Scottish Cup-winning side before the war. Others joined club and would go on to represent Scotland while at the club \u2013 [[George Aitken (footballer born 1925)|George Aitken]], [[Davie Duncan]], [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]], [[Henry Morris (footballer)|Henry Morris]], [[Charlie Fleming]] and [[Andy Matthew]]. Others such as [[Jimmy Philp]] and winger and later Scottish League cap [[Bobby Black (footballer)|Bobby Black]] were among those who picked up cup winners medals at the club.<ref name=autogeneratedbobby /> [[Harold Davis (footballer)|Harold Davis]] was on the books for a number of seasons but rarely played. This was due to Davis fulfilling his national service in the [[Korean War]] in which he was seriously injured in combat. Davis took two years to recover from his injuries. He then played a couple of games for the first team before following Symon to Rangers.\n\nEast Fife spent ten successive seasons in Scotland's top league. Away from this period the club have spent only four other seasons playing in Scotland's top division.\n\n=== Late 20th century ===\nEast Fife were relegated from Scotland's top division at the end of [[1957\u201358 in Scottish football|season 1957\u201358]]. Since then, the Methil outfit has struggled to match previous success. This is emphasised by the fact that aside from three seasons during the early 1970s, the club has played all of its football outside the top league since the 1950s.\n\nIn November 1998, East Fife moved to a purpose built stadium near [[Methil power station]].\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe [[2006\u201307 in Scottish football|2006\u201307 season]] saw East Fife begin the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Scottish Third Division]] campaign impressively, at one point amassing a commanding nine point lead over their nearest rivals. The Fifer's form declined markedly but recovered to qualify for the newly implemented promotion play-offs. East Fife beat [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] outfit [[Stranraer F.C.|Stranraer]] 4\u20132 on aggregate before losing 7\u20132 to [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] on aggregate in the final.

The first was laid across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, [[Valentia Island]] in western [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content Cable Station|Heart's Content]] in eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] from ten days\u2014the time it took to deliver a message by ship\u2014to a matter of minutes. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]]s.\n\n[[Cyrus West Field]] and the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=The Conquest of the Atlantic|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=1|pages=53\u201356/67|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2299492|ref=harv}}</ref> The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] to [[President of the United States]] [[James Buchanan]] on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when [[Wildman Whitehouse]] applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Cogan|first1=D.|title=Dr E.O.W. Whitehouse and the 1858 trans-Atlantic Cable|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Books/Whitehouse/DDC/index.htm|website=History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906145610/http://atlantic-cable.com/Books/Whitehouse/DDC/index.htm|archivedate=2009-09-06}}</ref> The cable's rapid failure undermined public and investor confidence and delayed efforts to restore a connection. A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.\n\nBefore the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866.  Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Eastern||6}}, captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Morse]] proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That same year Bishop [[John T. Mullock]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], proposed a telegraph line through the forest from [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] to [[Cape Ray]], and cables across the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from Cape Ray to [[Nova Scotia]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAt about the same time a similar plan occurred to [[Frederic Newton Gisborne]], a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851, Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and, having formed a company, began the construction of the landline. In 1853 his company collapsed, he was arrested for debt and he lost everything.\n\n== A plan takes shape ==\nIn 1854 Gisborne was introduced to [[Cyrus West Field]]. Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nField was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant [[Matthew Maury]], an authority on [[oceanography]].  The charts Maury constructed from [[depth sounding|soundings]] in the logs of multiple ships indicated that there was a feasible route across the Atlantic.  The area seemed so ideal for cable laying that Maury named it [[Telegraph Plateau]].  Maury's charts also predicted that a route going directly to the US was too rugged to be tenable, as well as being longer.<ref>Rozwadowski, p. 83</ref>  Field adopted Gisborne's scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking, and promoted the [[New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company]] to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.\n\nThe first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Fields brother, Matthew.<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref>  In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It was laid out from a [[barque]] in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a [[gale]] rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a [[steamboat]] was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.<ref name=\"HindKeefer1864\">{{cite book|author1=Henry Youle Hind|author2=Thomas C.

Brett's [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] laid the first ocean cable in 1850 across the [[English Channel]] and his [[English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company]] had laid a cable to Ireland in 1853 which was the deepest cable laid up to that date.<ref>Bright, p. 14</ref>  Further reason for the trip were that all the commercial manufacturers of submarine cable were in Britain,<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref> and Field had failed to raise significant funds for the project in New York.<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>\n\nField pushed the project ahead with tremendous energy and speed.  Even before forming the a company to carry out the project, Field ordered 2,500 miles of cable from the [[Gutta Percha Company]].<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>  The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in October 1856 with Brett as president and Field as vice-president.  [[Charles Tilston Bright]], who already worked for Brett, was made chief engineer.  [[Wildman Whitehouse]], a medical doctor, was appointed chief electrician.  Field provided a quarter of the capital himself.<ref>Clayton, p. 30</ref>  After the  remaining shares were sold, largely to existing investors in Brett's company,<ref>Kieve, pp. 106\u2013107</ref> an unpaid board of directors was formed which included [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], the future Lord Kelvin and a respected scientist.  Thomson also acted as a scientific advisor.<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>  Morse, who was a shareholder in the Nova Scotia project and acted as the electrical advisor, was also on the board.<ref>Cookson pp. 28\u201329, 96</ref>\n\n== First transatlantic cable ==\n[[File:atlanticcablestamp.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|A [[U.S. postage stamp]] issued to commemorate the Atlantic cable centenary]]\nThe cable consisted of seven copper wires, each weighing 26&nbsp;kg/km (107 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s per [[nautical mile]]), covered with three coats of [[gutta-percha]] (as suggested by [[Jonathan Nash Hearder]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101012824/ |title=Hearder, Jonathan Nash (1809\u20131876) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |last=Hearder |first=Ian G. |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=September 2004 |accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref>), weighing 64&nbsp;kg/km (261&nbsp;pounds per nautical mile), and wound with tarred [[hemp]], over which a sheath of 18 strands, each of seven iron wires, was laid in a close helix. It weighed nearly 550&nbsp;kg/km (1.1&nbsp;tons per nautical mile), was relatively flexible and was able to withstand a pull of several tens of [[kilonewton]]s (several tons).\n\nThe cable from the Gutta Percha Company was armoured separately by wire rope manufacturers, as was the usual practice at the time.  In the rush to proceed, only four months were allowed for completion of the cable.<ref>Burns, p. 140</ref>  As no wire rope maker had the capacity to make so much cable on that timescale, the task was shared by two English firms \u2013 [[Enderby's Wharf|Glass, Elliot & Co.]], of [[Greenwich]], and [[R.S. Newall and Company]], of [[Birkenhead]].<ref>Cookson, p. 69</ref> Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions.<ref>Cookson, p. 73</ref>  This meant that the two sections of cable could not be directly splices wire-to-wire as the iron wire on both cables would unwind when it was put under tension during laying.<ref>Lindley, pp. 134\u2013135</ref>  The problem was easily solved by splicing through an improvised wooden bracket to hold the wires in place,<ref>Lindley, p. 135</ref> but the mistake subsequently became magnified in the public mind.<ref>Cookson, p. 73</ref>\n\nThe British government gave Field a subsidy of \u00a31,400 a year (\u00a3{{inflation|UK|1400|1856|fmt=c|r=-4}} today) and loaned the ships needed. Field also solicited aid from the U.S. government. A bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The subsidy bill passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a single vote, due to opposition from protectionist senators. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the bill encountered similar resistance, but passed, and was signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nThe first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and [[USS Niagara (1855)|USS ''Niagara'']] borrowed from their respective governments.  Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold 2,500 miles of cable alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  The cable was started at the white strand near [[Ballycarbery Castle]] in [[County Kerry]], on the southwest coast of [[Ireland]], on August 5, 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Books/1857Isaac/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 1857 \u2013 Laying the Atlantic Telegraph From Ship To Shore |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref> The cable broke on the first day, but was [[Grappling hook|grappled]] and repaired; it broke again over the Telegraph Plateau, nearly 3,200&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;[[statute mile]]s) deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year.  300 miles of cable had been lost, but with 1,800 miles still remaining, the director's agreed to try again the following year.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Also in this period, Morse clashed with Field, is removed from the board, and takes no further part in the enterprise.<ref>{{multiref|Lindley, p. 134|Cookson, p. 96}}</ref>\n\nThe problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out.  A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the [[Bay of Biscay]] with ''Agamemnon'' in May 1858.<ref>Lindley, pp. 130, 133</ref>  On 10 June, ''Agamemnon'' and ''Niagara'' set sail to try again.  Ten days out they found themselves in a severe storm and the enterprise was nearly brought to a premature end.  The ships were top heavy with cable that could not all fit in the hold and strugggled not to capsize.  Ten sailors were hurt and Thomson's electrical cabin was flooded.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref> The vessels met in the middle of the Atlantic on 25 June and attempted to [[line splice|splice]] cable from the two shipstogether, and while ''Agamemnon'' paid out eastwards to Valentia Island, ''Niagara'' was to pay out westward to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. On June 26, the middle splice was made and the cable was dropped. Again the cable broke, the first time after less than 5.5&nbsp;km (three nautical miles), again after some 100&nbsp;km (54&nbsp;nautical miles) and for a third time when about 370&nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) of cable had run out of each vessel.\n\nThe expedition returned to [[Queenstown, County Cork]], Ireland, and set out again on July 17, with little enthusiasm among the crews. The middle splice was finished on July 29, 1858. The cable ran easily this time. ''Niagara'' arrived in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay, Newfoundland]] on August 4 and the next morning the shore end was landed. ''Agamemnon'' made an equally successful run. On August 5, she arrived at Valentia Island, and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1858Leslies/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper 1858 Cable News |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==First contact==\n[[File:Irl-ValentiaTelegraph.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Telegraph Field,<ref name=tel-field>{{cite web|url=http://thetelegraphfield.com|title=\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|website=thetelegraphfield.com}}</ref> [[Valentia Island]], Ireland, the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America.

Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career.  He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience.  The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson's [[law of squares]] when he presented it to a [[British Association]] meeting in 1855.  Thomson's law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation.<ref>Lindley, p. 125</ref>  To put this to the test, Bright gave Whitehouse overnight access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company's long underground lines.<ref>Cookson, pp. 56\u201357</ref>.  He joined several lines together to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declared that there would be no problem.<ref>Bright, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  Morse was also present at this test and supported Whitehouse.<ref>Cookson, p. 57</ref>  Thomson believed that Whitehouse's measurements were flawed and that underground and underwater cables were not fully comparable.<ref>Lindley, pp. 126\u2013127</ref>  Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed, which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares.  In mid-1857, on his own initiative, he examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two.  But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n[[File:Edward-orange-wildman-whitehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wildman Whitehouse]]\nAnother point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying.  Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions.  This would halve the time taken to complete.  Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress could be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Whitehouse overruled Thomson's suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel, but he declined to go at the last moment.  He repeatedly did this; for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the [[Bay of Biscay]],<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref> and the attempt in 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place,<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref> and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict, but in the event Thomson went alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n[[File:Thomsons mirror galvanometer, 1858. (9663806048).jpg|thumb|Thomson's mirror galvanometer]]\nAfter his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required.  He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his [[mirror galvanometer]].  This was an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any existing equipment.  He requested \u00a32,000 from the board to build several of them, but was only given \u00a3500 for a prototype, and permission to trial it on the next voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>  The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive, or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse 'dash' and a Morse 'dot' (this was the standard system on submarine cables \u2013 both pulse types were the same length, unlike overland telegraph).  Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment even over the vast length of the Atlantic cable.  He successfully tested the instrument on 2,700 miles of cable in underwater storage at [[Plymouth]].<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe mirror galvanometer proved to be yet another point of contention.  Whitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme.<ref>Voice Across the Sea \u2013 Arthur C Clarke</ref>  He wanted to drive the line with a massive high-voltage [[induction coil]], producing several thousand volts, so that enough current was available to drive standard electromechanical [[printing telegraph]]s used on inland telegraphs.<ref>Lindley, p. 139</ref>  Thomson's instrument had to be read by hand.  It was not capable of printing, but much later he invented the [[syphon recorder]] for the second transatlantic attempt in 1866.<ref>Clayton, p. 73</ref>  The decision to start mid-Atlantic combined with Whitehouse dropping out of another voyage left Thomson, on board ''Agememnon'' sailing towards Ireland, with a free hand to use his equipment without Whitehouse's interference.  Although Thomson had the status of a mere advisor to engineer C. W. de Sauty, it was not long before all electrical decisions were deferred to him.  Whitehouse in Valentia remained out of contact until the ship reached Ireland and landed the cable.<ref>Lindley, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nAround this time, the board started to have doubts over Whitehouse's generally negative attitude.  Not only did he repeatedly clash with Thomson, but he was also critical of Field, and his repeated refusal to carry out his primary duty as chief electrician on board ship made a very bad impression.  But at this time no action was taken.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe effects of the poor handling and design of the cable, coupled with Whitehouse's repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages, resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised.  All the while, it was taking longer and longer to send messages.  Towards the end, sending half a page of message text was taking as long as a day.\n\nIn September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed. The reaction to this news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax, and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation.  In the enquiry that followed, Dr Whitehouse was deemed responsible for the failure, and the company did not escape criticism for employing an electrical engineer with no recognised qualifications.\n\nAlthough the cable was never put into service for public use, and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing.  The collision between the [[Cunard Line]] ships ''Europa'' and ''Arabia'' was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving \u00a350,000.  A total of 732 messages were passed before failure.<ref name=\"Kieve, p. 109\"/>\n\n== Preparing a new attempt ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012|Just about all this section can be cited to the Kieve source I added}}\n\nField was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of [[Thomas Brassey]] and [[John Pender]], he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|BICC]]), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. [[C.F. Varley]] replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300 pounds per nautical mile (73&nbsp;kg/km), coated with [[Chatterton's compound]], then covered with four layers of [[gutta-percha]], alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400&nbsp;lb/nmi (98&nbsp;kg/km). This core was covered with [[hemp]] saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by [[Webster and Horsfall|Webster & Horsfall Ltd]] of Hay Mills [[Birmingham]], each covered with fine strands of [[manila hemp|manila]] yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long [[hundredweight]] (4000&nbsp;lb) per nautical mile (980&nbsp;kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old. The Haymills site successfully manufactured {{convert|30,000|mi|km}} of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over eleven months.\n\n== ''Great Eastern'' and the second attempt ==\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Great Eastern'' at [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]]]]\nThe new cable was laid by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']] captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cableships/GreatEastern/|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - Great Eastern|website=www.atlantic-cable.com}}</ref> Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of {{convert|2,300|nmi|km}} of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on July 15, 1865, ''Great Eastern'' left the [[Nore]] for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by ''Caroline''. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1,062&nbsp;miles (1968&nbsp;km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Gooch/index.html |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Daniel Gooch |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|1866}}<!--[[1866 transatlantic telegraph cable]] redirects here -->\n''Great Eastern'' steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus, and formed the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]],<ref>http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/AngloAmerican/index.htm Anglo-American Telegraph Company</ref> to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On July 13, 1866, ''Great Eastern'' started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Heart's Content in a thick fog. The next morning at 9&nbsp;a.m. a message from England cited these words from the [[editorial|leader]] in ''[[The Times]]'': \"It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.\" \"Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria.\" The shore end was landed during the day by ''Medway''. Congratulations poured in, and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States.\n\n[[File:Great Eastern Grappling Hook.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Grappling hook]] used for lifting the cable]]\nIn August 1866, several ships, including ''Great Eastern'', put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865. Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable, splice it to new cable, and complete the run to Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Recovery/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy-Recovery of the Lost Cable |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>   They were determined to find it, and their search was based solely upon positions recorded \"principally by Captain Moriarty, R.N.\" who placed the end of the lost cable at longitude 38\u00b0 50' W.<ref>Bright, Edward B., \"[http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Bright/index.htm Description of the Manufacture, Laying and Working of the Cables of 1865 and 1866...],\" History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications, Retrieved April 18, 2019.</ref>\n\nThere were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable {{cvt|2.5|mi|||}} down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. However, [[Robert Halpin]] navigated HMS ''Terrible'' and grappling ship ''Albany'' to the correct location.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Laying the French Atlantic Cable|journal=Nautical Magazine|year=1869|volume=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7o4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA460|accessdate=September 10, 2011|page=460|publisher=Brown, Son and Ferguson|quote=To have navigated the ship in a fog so exactly to her proper position was certainly a most wonderful testimony to Captain Halpin's judgment and skill, ...}}</ref>  ''Albany'' moved slowly here and there, \"fishing\" for the lost cable with a five-pronged [[grappling hook]] at the end of a stout rope. Suddenly, on August 10, ''Albany'' \"caught\" the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. ''Great Eastern'' and another grappling ship, ''Medway'', arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board ''Great Eastern''. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content, Newfoundland]], where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.\n\n== Repairing the cable ==\nBroken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=transatlantic+cable+buoy&source=bl&ots=vM5O99xNRP&sig=3J7hvgSPZ2usC7pZwgw3-ZfJgo0&hl=en&ei=ugXKTcmWC-jkiAKmoaWjBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=transatlantic+cable+buoy&f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia britannica Company|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1915CCC/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - 1915: How submarine cables are made and laid|website=atlantic-cable.com}}</ref>\n\n==Communication speeds==\nInitially messages were sent by an operator sending [[Morse code]].

[[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin]] in later decades understood that the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]], which causes a severe [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] and hence a signal distortion; see [[Telegrapher's equations]]. This has to be solved by iron tape or by [[load coil]]s. It was not until the 20th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120 words per minute. Despite this, London had become the world center in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from [[Porthcurno]] Cable Station near [[Land's End]] and formed with their Commonwealth links a \"live\" girdle around the world; the [[All Red Line]].\n\n== Later cables ==\nAdditional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Need a citation for both sentences here.}}\n\nThe original cables were not fitted with [[repeater]]s, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation.  Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line.  On telegraph lines this is done with [[relay]]s, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was [[TAT-1]] in 1956.  This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.\n\n==Impact==\nA 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Steinwender|first=Claudia|date=2018|title=Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom Became United|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150681|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=657\u2013696|doi=10.1257/aer.20150681|issn=0002-8282|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study estimates that \"the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to 8 percent of export value\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Halpin]] \u2013 Captain of ''Great Eastern''\n* [[Transatlantic telephone cable]]\n* [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] \u2013 overland alternative via Russia\n* [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]]\n* [[Commercial Cable Company]]\n* [[Enderby's Wharf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* [[Charles Tilston Bright|Bright, Charles Tilston]], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_00867/page/n3 ''Submarine Telegraphs''], London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 {{oclc|776529627}}.\n* Burns, Russell W., ''Communications: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 2004 {{ISBN|0863413277}}.\n* [[Arthur C.

The first was laid across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, [[Valentia Island]] in western [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content Cable Station|Heart's Content]] in eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] from ten days\u2014the time it took to deliver a message by ship\u2014to a matter of minutes. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]]s.\n\n[[Cyrus West Field]] and the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=The Conquest of the Atlantic|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=1|pages=53\u201356/67|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2299492|ref=harv}}</ref> The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] to [[President of the United States]] [[James Buchanan]] on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when [[Wildman Whitehouse]] applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Cogan|first1=D.|title=Dr E.O.W.

A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.\n\nBefore the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866.  Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Eastern||6}}, captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Morse]] proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That same year Bishop [[John T. Mullock]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], proposed a telegraph line through the forest from [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] to [[Cape Ray]], and cables across the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from Cape Ray to [[Nova Scotia]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAt about the same time a similar plan occurred to [[Frederic Newton Gisborne]], a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851, Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and, having formed a company, began the construction of the landline. In 1853 his company collapsed, he was arrested for debt and he lost everything.\n\n== A plan takes shape ==\nIn 1854 Gisborne was introduced to [[Cyrus West Field]]. Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nField was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant [[Matthew Maury]], an authority on [[oceanography]].  The charts Maury constructed from [[depth sounding|soundings]] in the logs of multiple ships indicated that there was a feasible route across the Atlantic.  The area seemed so ideal for cable laying that Maury named it [[Telegraph Plateau]].  Maury's charts also predicted that a route going directly to the US was too rugged to be tenable, as well as being longer.<ref>Rozwadowski, p. 83</ref>  Field adopted Gisborne's scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking, and promoted the [[New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company]] to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.\n\nThe first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Fields brother, Matthew.<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref>  In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It was laid out from a [[barque]] in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a [[gale]] rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a [[steamboat]] was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.<ref name=\"HindKeefer1864\">{{cite book|author1=Henry Youle Hind|author2=Thomas C.

Brett's [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] laid the first ocean cable in 1850 across the [[English Channel]] and his [[English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company]] had laid a cable to Ireland in 1853 which was the deepest cable laid up to that date.<ref>Bright, p. 14</ref>  Further reason for the trip were that all the commercial manufacturers of submarine cable were in Britain,<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref> and Field had failed to raise significant funds for the project in New York.<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>\n\nField pushed the project ahead with tremendous energy and speed.  Even before forming the a company to carry out the project, Field ordered 2,500 miles of cable from the [[Gutta Percha Company]].<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>  The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in October 1856 with Brett as president and Field as vice-president.  [[Charles Tilston Bright]], who already worked for Brett, was made chief engineer.  [[Wildman Whitehouse]], a medical doctor, was appointed chief electrician.  Field provided a quarter of the capital himself.<ref>Clayton, p. 30</ref>  After the  remaining shares were sold, largely to existing investors in Brett's company,<ref>Kieve, pp. 106\u2013107</ref> an unpaid board of directors was formed which included [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], the future Lord Kelvin and a respected scientist.  Thomson also acted as a scientific advisor.<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>  Morse, who was a shareholder in the Nova Scotia project and acted as the electrical advisor, was also on the board.<ref>Cookson pp. 96</ref>\n\n== First transatlantic cable ==\n[[File:atlanticcablestamp.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|A [[U.S. postage stamp]] issued to commemorate the Atlantic cable centenary]]\nThe cable consisted of seven copper wires, each weighing 26&nbsp;kg/km (107 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s per [[nautical mile]]), covered with three coats of [[gutta-percha]] (as suggested by [[Jonathan Nash Hearder]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101012824/ |title=Hearder, Jonathan Nash (1809\u20131876) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |last=Hearder |first=Ian G. |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=September 2004 |accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref>), weighing 64&nbsp;kg/km (261&nbsp;pounds per nautical mile), and wound with tarred [[hemp]], over which a sheath of 18 strands, each of seven iron wires, was laid in a close helix. It weighed nearly 550&nbsp;kg/km (1.1&nbsp;tons per nautical mile), was relatively flexible and was able to withstand a pull of several tens of [[kilonewton]]s (several tons).\n\nThe cable from the Gutta Percha Company was armoured separately by wire rope manufacturers, as was the usual practice at the time.  In the rush to proceed, only four months were allowed for completion of the cable.<ref>Burns, p. 140</ref>  As no wire rope maker had the capacity to make so much cable on that timescale, the task was shared by two English firms \u2013 [[Enderby's Wharf|Glass, Elliot & Co.]], of [[Greenwich]], and [[R.S. Newall and Company]], of [[Birkenhead]].<ref>Cookson, p. 69</ref> Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions.<ref>Cookson, p. 73</ref>  This meant that the two sections of cable could not be directly splices wire-to-wire as the iron wire on both cables would unwind when it was put under tension during laying.<ref>Lindley, pp. 134\u2013135</ref>  The problem was easily solved by splicing through an improvised wooden bracket to hold the wires in place,<ref>Lindley, p. 135</ref> but the mistake subsequently became magnified in the public mind.<ref>Cookson, p. 73</ref>\n\nThe British government gave Field a subsidy of \u00a31,400 a year (\u00a3{{inflation|UK|1400|1856|fmt=c|r=-4}} today) and loaned the ships needed. Field also solicited aid from the U.S. government. A bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The subsidy bill passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a single vote, due to opposition from protectionist senators. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the bill encountered similar resistance, but passed, and was signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nThe first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and [[USS Niagara (1855)|USS ''Niagara'']] borrowed from their respective governments.  Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold 2,500 miles of cable alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  The cable was started at the white strand near [[Ballycarbery Castle]] in [[County Kerry]], on the southwest coast of [[Ireland]], on August 5, 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Books/1857Isaac/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 1857 \u2013 Laying the Atlantic Telegraph From Ship To Shore |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref> The cable broke on the first day, but was [[Grappling hook|grappled]] and repaired; it broke again over the Telegraph Plateau, nearly 3,200&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;[[statute mile]]s) deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year.  300 miles of cable had been lost, but with 1,800 miles still remaining, the director's agreed to try again the following year.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Also in this period, Morse clashed with Field, is removed from the board, and takes no further part in the enterprise.<ref>{{multiref|Lindley, p. 134|Cookson, p. 96}}</ref>\n\nThe problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out.  A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the [[Bay of Biscay]] with ''Agamemnon'' in May 1858.<ref>Lindley, pp. 130, 133</ref>  On 10 June, ''Agamemnon'' and ''Niagara'' set sail to try again.  Ten days out they found themselves in a severe storm and the enterprise was nearly brought to a premature end.  The ships were top heavy with cable that could not all fit in the hold and strugggled not to capsize.  Ten sailors were hurt and Thomson's electrical cabin was flooded.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref> The vessels met in the middle of the Atlantic on 25 June and attempted to [[line splice|splice]] cable from the two shipstogether, and while ''Agamemnon'' paid out eastwards to Valentia Island, ''Niagara'' was to pay out westward to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. On June 26, the middle splice was made and the cable was dropped. Again the cable broke, the first time after less than 5.5&nbsp;km (three nautical miles), again after some 100&nbsp;km (54&nbsp;nautical miles) and for a third time when about 370&nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) of cable had run out of each vessel.\n\nThe expedition returned to [[Queenstown, County Cork]], Ireland, and set out again on July 17, with little enthusiasm among the crews. The middle splice was finished on July 29, 1858. The cable ran easily this time. ''Niagara'' arrived in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay, Newfoundland]] on August 4 and the next morning the shore end was landed. ''Agamemnon'' made an equally successful run. On August 5, she arrived at Valentia Island, and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1858Leslies/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper 1858 Cable News |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==First contact==\n[[File:Irl-ValentiaTelegraph.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Telegraph Field,<ref name=tel-field>{{cite web|url=http://thetelegraphfield.com|title=\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|website=thetelegraphfield.com}}</ref> [[Valentia Island]], Ireland, the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America.

Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career.  He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience.  The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson's [[law of squares]] when he presented it to a [[British Association]] meeting in 1855.  Thomson's law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation.<ref>Lindley, p. 125</ref>  To put this to the test, Bright gave Whitehouse overnight access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company's long underground lines.<ref>Cookson, pp. 56\u201357</ref>.  He joined several lines together to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declared that there would be no problem.<ref>Bright, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  Morse was also present at this test and supported Whitehouse.<ref>Cookson, p. 57</ref>  Thomson believed that Whitehouse's measurements were flawed and that underground and underwater cables were not fully comparable.<ref>Lindley, pp. 126\u2013127</ref>  Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed, which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares.  In mid-1857, on his own initiative, he examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two.  But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n[[File:Edward-orange-wildman-whitehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wildman Whitehouse]]\nAnother point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying.  Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions.  This would halve the time taken to complete.  Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress could be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Whitehouse overruled Thomson's suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel, but he declined to go at the last moment.  He repeatedly did this; for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the [[Bay of Biscay]],<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref> and the attempt in 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place,<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref> and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict, but in the event Thomson went alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n[[File:Thomsons mirror galvanometer, 1858. (9663806048).jpg|thumb|Thomson's mirror galvanometer]]\nAfter his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required.  He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his [[mirror galvanometer]].  This was an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any existing equipment.  He requested \u00a32,000 from the board to build several of them, but was only given \u00a3500 for a prototype, and permission to trial it on the next voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>  The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive, or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse 'dash' and a Morse 'dot' (this was the standard system on submarine cables \u2013 both pulse types were the same length, unlike overland telegraph).  Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment even over the vast length of the Atlantic cable.  He successfully tested the instrument on 2,700 miles of cable in underwater storage at [[Plymouth]].<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe mirror galvanometer proved to be yet another point of contention.  Whitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme.<ref>Voice Across the Sea \u2013 Arthur C Clarke</ref>  He wanted to drive the line with a massive high-voltage [[induction coil]], producing several thousand volts, so that enough current was available to drive standard electromechanical [[printing telegraph]]s used on inland telegraphs.<ref>Lindley, p. 139</ref>  Thomson's instrument had to be read by hand.  It was not capable of printing, but much later he invented the [[syphon recorder]] for the second transatlantic attempt in 1866.<ref>Clayton, p. 73</ref>  The decision to start mid-Atlantic combined with Whitehouse dropping out of another voyage left Thomson, on board ''Agememnon'' sailing towards Ireland, with a free hand to use his equipment without Whitehouse's interference.  Although Thomson had the status of a mere advisor to engineer C. W. de Sauty, it was not long before all electrical decisions were deferred to him.  Whitehouse in Valentia remained out of contact until the ship reached Ireland and landed the cable.<ref>Lindley, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nAround this time, the board started to have doubts over Whitehouse's generally negative attitude.  Not only did he repeatedly clash with Thomson, but he was also critical of Field, and his repeated refusal to carry out his primary duty as chief electrician on board ship made a very bad impression.  But at this time no action was taken.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe effects of the poor handling and design of the cable, coupled with Whitehouse's repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages, resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised.  All the while, it was taking longer and longer to send messages.  Towards the end, sending half a page of message text was taking as long as a day.\n\nIn September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed. The reaction to this news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax, and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation.  In the enquiry that followed, Dr Whitehouse was deemed responsible for the failure, and the company did not escape criticism for employing an electrical engineer with no recognised qualifications.\n\nAlthough the cable was never put into service for public use, and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing.  The collision between the [[Cunard Line]] ships ''Europa'' and ''Arabia'' was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving \u00a350,000.  A total of 732 messages were passed before failure.<ref name=\"Kieve, p. 109\"/>\n\n== Preparing a new attempt ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012|Just about all this section can be cited to the Kieve source I added}}\n\nField was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of [[Thomas Brassey]] and [[John Pender]], he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|BICC]]), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. [[C.F. Varley]] replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300 pounds per nautical mile (73&nbsp;kg/km), coated with [[Chatterton's compound]], then covered with four layers of [[gutta-percha]], alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400&nbsp;lb/nmi (98&nbsp;kg/km). This core was covered with [[hemp]] saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by [[Webster and Horsfall|Webster & Horsfall Ltd]] of Hay Mills [[Birmingham]], each covered with fine strands of [[manila hemp|manila]] yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long [[hundredweight]] (4000&nbsp;lb) per nautical mile (980&nbsp;kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old. The Haymills site successfully manufactured {{convert|30,000|mi|km}} of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over eleven months.\n\n== ''Great Eastern'' and the second attempt ==\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Great Eastern'' at [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]]]]\nThe new cable was laid by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']] captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cableships/GreatEastern/|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - Great Eastern|website=www.atlantic-cable.com}}</ref> Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of {{convert|2,300|nmi|km}} of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on July 15, 1865, ''Great Eastern'' left the [[Nore]] for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by ''Caroline''. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1,062&nbsp;miles (1968&nbsp;km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Gooch/index.html |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Daniel Gooch |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|1866}}<!--[[1866 transatlantic telegraph cable]] redirects here -->\n''Great Eastern'' steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus, and formed the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]],<ref>http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/AngloAmerican/index.htm Anglo-American Telegraph Company</ref> to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On July 13, 1866, ''Great Eastern'' started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Heart's Content in a thick fog. The next morning at 9&nbsp;a.m. a message from England cited these words from the [[editorial|leader]] in ''[[The Times]]'': \"It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.\" \"Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria.\" The shore end was landed during the day by ''Medway''. Congratulations poured in, and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States.\n\n[[File:Great Eastern Grappling Hook.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Grappling hook]] used for lifting the cable]]\nIn August 1866, several ships, including ''Great Eastern'', put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865. Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable, splice it to new cable, and complete the run to Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Recovery/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy-Recovery of the Lost Cable |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>   They were determined to find it, and their search was based solely upon positions recorded \"principally by Captain Moriarty, R.N.\" who placed the end of the lost cable at longitude 38\u00b0 50' W.<ref>Bright, Edward B., \"[http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Bright/index.htm Description of the Manufacture, Laying and Working of the Cables of 1865 and 1866...],\" History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications, Retrieved April 18, 2019.</ref>\n\nThere were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable {{cvt|2.5|mi|||}} down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. However, [[Robert Halpin]] navigated HMS ''Terrible'' and grappling ship ''Albany'' to the correct location.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Laying the French Atlantic Cable|journal=Nautical Magazine|year=1869|volume=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7o4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA460|accessdate=September 10, 2011|page=460|publisher=Brown, Son and Ferguson|quote=To have navigated the ship in a fog so exactly to her proper position was certainly a most wonderful testimony to Captain Halpin's judgment and skill, ...}}</ref>  ''Albany'' moved slowly here and there, \"fishing\" for the lost cable with a five-pronged [[grappling hook]] at the end of a stout rope. Suddenly, on August 10, ''Albany'' \"caught\" the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. ''Great Eastern'' and another grappling ship, ''Medway'', arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board ''Great Eastern''. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content, Newfoundland]], where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.\n\n== Repairing the cable ==\nBroken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=transatlantic+cable+buoy&source=bl&ots=vM5O99xNRP&sig=3J7hvgSPZ2usC7pZwgw3-ZfJgo0&hl=en&ei=ugXKTcmWC-jkiAKmoaWjBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=transatlantic+cable+buoy&f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia britannica Company|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1915CCC/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - 1915: How submarine cables are made and laid|website=atlantic-cable.com}}</ref>\n\n==Communication speeds==\nInitially messages were sent by an operator sending [[Morse code]]. The reception was very bad on the 1858 cable, and it took two minutes to transmit just one character (a single letter or a single number), a rate of about 0.1 [[words per minute]]. This is despite the use of a highly sensitive [[mirror galvanometer]], a new invention at the time.\n\nThe first message on the 1858 cable took over 17 hours to transmit.<ref name=lac-fam-msg>{{cite web |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/cable/fmessages.htm |work=Famous Messages Received and Sent |title=1858 August 16 Queen Victoria Sends Telegram to President Buchanan |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate = July 9, 2010}}</ref>  For the 1866 cable, the methods of cable manufacture, as well as sending messages, had been vastly improved.

[[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin]] in later decades understood that the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]], which causes a severe [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] and hence a signal distortion; see [[Telegrapher's equations]]. This has to be solved by iron tape or by [[load coil]]s. It was not until the 20th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120 words per minute. Despite this, London had become the world center in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from [[Porthcurno]] Cable Station near [[Land's End]] and formed with their Commonwealth links a \"live\" girdle around the world; the [[All Red Line]].\n\n== Later cables ==\nAdditional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Need a citation for both sentences here.}}\n\nThe original cables were not fitted with [[repeater]]s, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation.  Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line.  On telegraph lines this is done with [[relay]]s, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was [[TAT-1]] in 1956.  This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.\n\n==Impact==\nA 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Steinwender|first=Claudia|date=2018|title=Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom Became United|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150681|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=657\u2013696|doi=10.1257/aer.20150681|issn=0002-8282|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study estimates that \"the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to 8 percent of export value\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Halpin]] \u2013 Captain of ''Great Eastern''\n* [[Transatlantic telephone cable]]\n* [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] \u2013 overland alternative via Russia\n* [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]]\n* [[Commercial Cable Company]]\n* [[Enderby's Wharf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* [[Charles Tilston Bright|Bright, Charles Tilston]], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_00867/page/n3 ''Submarine Telegraphs''], London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 {{oclc|776529627}}.\n* Burns, Russell W., ''Communications: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 2004 {{ISBN|0863413277}}.\n* [[Arthur C.

This abbey is called \"[[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]]\" and was crafted in 640 AD at the outskirts of the Mountains of Alqosh. It was used as the Seat for many [[patriarchs]] of the [[Church of the East]]. From this monastery came [[Yohannan Sulaqa]], who decided to unite with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1553 AD and established the ''Church of Assyria and Mosul'', which by the 18th century had become renamed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] by Rome.\n\nBefore that, all of the inhabitants of Alqosh, like their brothers in other Assyrian towns, followed what is erroneously called the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] faith, but actuality were a part of the [[Church of the East]]. From 1610 to 1617, the Patriarchate of Alqosh, under Mar Eliyya VIII, entered in [[Full Communion]] with [[Rome]]. the union was reinstated later in 1771 when the patriarch Eliya Denkha signed a Catholic confession of faith, although no formal union resulted till the reign of patriarch [[Yohannan Hormizd|Yohannan VIII (Eliya) Hormizd]] (1760\u20131838).<ref name=\"Frazee\">{{cite book |last=Frazee|first=Charles A.|title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453\u20131923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|page=210}}</ref>\n\n===Prophet Nahum and Alqosh===\nThe ancient synagogue in Alqosh reportedly contains the tomb of the prophet [[Nahum]], who correctly predicted the end of the [[Assyria|Assyrian Empire]]. Nahum's bones have been relocated to a nearby church. It was common for [[Iraqi Jews]] to make a pilgrimage to Alqosh during [[Shavuot]]. \u201cHe who has not made the pilgrimage to Nahum\u2019s tomb has not yet known real pleasure,\u201d was a common saying.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neurink|first1=Judit|title=Kurdistan needs help to preserve its Jewish heritage|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Kurdistan-needs-help-to-preserve-its-Jewish-heritage-407996|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Destruction==\nThroughout its history, Alqosh has fallen victim to many calamities, most due to their oppressive Muslim neighbors and various overlords. Many attacks occurred after Alqosh started to house the abbey of [[Rabban Hormizd]], which was used as the Seat for several patriarchs of the Chaldean Church, as it attracted the attention of several Muslims looking to harass their Christian neighbors.\n\nAccording to the [[testimony]], written in a letter by the Qasha Habash Bin Jomaa from 1746, he describes; \"... first they attacked [[Karamles]] and stole its peoples valuables and kidnapped many of its children and women. They then did the same to the inhabitants of [[Bartella]] they killed many of her men, stole their valuables, and also kidnapped its children and women. They did the same to the people of Tel Keppe and Alqosh, however, many of those two neighboring villages took refuge at the Monastery of Rabban Hirmizd. There they were surrounded by the soldiers of Nader Shah who attacked them and then massacred them. There they committed horrendous crimes that I just don't have the stomach to describe!\"\n\nIn 1828, Alqosh was attacked by the army of Mosa Pasha, the governor of Amadeya, who was instigated by some of his Muslim subjects to attack the Rabban Hirmizd Monastery which he did.  His army arrested and imprisoned several monks and priests and caused tremendous damage to the monastery.\n[[File:Iraqvillagealqosh10.JPG|thumb|left|Party in Alqosh]]\n===Other attacks===\n* The village was attacked and sacked by [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) in 1401 AD.<ref name=\"Wilmshurst\" />\n* Alqosh was attacked in 1508 AD by Pasha of [[Baghdad]] Bar Yak (Murad Bey).<ref name=\"Wilmshurst\" >{{cite book |author1=David Wilmshurst |title=The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913 |date=2000 |publisher=Peeters Publishers |isbn=9042908769 |edition=582}}</ref>\n* Mosa Pasha, the governor of [[Amadiya]], approached Alqosh and put fire to Rabban Hermizd Monastery in 1828 AD.<ref name=\"hannetc\" >{{cite book |author1=Geoff Hann, Karen Dabrowska, Tina Townsend-Greaves |title=Iraq: The ancient sites and Iraqi Kurdistan |date=2015 |isbn=1841624888}}</ref>\n* Mohammed Pasha (Mira Koor), the Kurdish prince of [[Rowanduz]] attacked Alqosh, killing over 600 of its inhabitants in 1832 AD.<ref name=\"hannetc\" />\n* Resoul Beck, Mira Koor's brother, repeated the attack in 1840 AD.<ref name=\"hannetc\" />\n* In 2014, the terrorists associated with the radical [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) came close to Alqosh.

A report by the United Nations stated that 504 Assyrians at once migrated to Alqosh. Many Assyrians from Mosul and Baghdad since the post-2003 Iraq war have fled to Alqosh for safety.

This abbey is called \"[[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]]\" and was crafted in 640 AD at the outskirts of the Mountains of Alqosh. It was used as the Seat for many [[patriarchs]] of the [[Church of the East]]. From this monastery came [[Yohannan Sulaqa]], who decided to unite with the [[Catholic Church]] in 1553 AD and established the ''Church of Assyria and Mosul'', which by the 18th century had become renamed the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] by Rome.\n\nBefore that, all of the inhabitants of Alqosh, like their brothers in other Assyrian towns, followed what is erroneously called the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] faith, but actuality were a part of the [[Church of the East]]. From 1610 to 1617, the Patriarchate of Alqosh, under Mar Eliyya VIII, entered in [[Full Communion]] with [[Rome]]. the union was reinstated later in 1771 when the patriarch Eliya Denkha signed a Catholic confession of faith, although no formal union resulted till the reign of patriarch [[Yohannan Hormizd|Yohannan VIII (Eliya) Hormizd]] (1760\u20131838).<ref name=\"Frazee\">{{cite book |last=Frazee|first=Charles A.|title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453\u20131923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7|page=210}}</ref>\n\n===Prophet Nahum and Alqosh===\nThe ancient synagogue in Alqosh reportedly contains the tomb of the prophet [[Nahum]], who correctly predicted the end of the [[Assyria|Assyrian Empire]].

It became widely famous in [[Latin America]], particularly in [[Colombia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Panama]], [[Mexico]], [[Per\u00fa]] and other [[Caribbean]] area countries. The Japanese salsa band Orquesta de La Luz was quite a large one, whose main focal point (and only consistent member throughout their tenure together) was singer Nora. Throughout the years, Nora was joined by a rotating cast of musicians in the group, including Gen Ogimi, percussion; Carlos Kanno, percussion; Genichi Egawa, timbales; Gen Date, conga; Hiroshi Sawada, bass; Satoru Shoinoya, piano, keyboards; Shiro Sasaki, trumpet; Tatsuya Shimogami, trumpet; Yoshihito Fukumoto, trumpet; Hideaki Nakaji, trombone; and Taisei Aoki, trombone, while co-producer/arranger Sergio George contributed keyboards from time to time. The group built a substantial following in their homeland during the early to mid-'90s (with such releases as 1990's Orquesta de La Luz, 1991's Sin Fronteras, and 1992's {{lang|es|Somos Diferentes}}), before switching their sound primarily to jazz and ballads. By 1995, Orquesta de La Luz had broken up, with Nora launching a solo career shortly thereafter (and returning to her former band's early salsa sound).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Biography & History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/orquesta-de-la-luz-mn0000482481|website=All Music|publisher=RhythmOne Group|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n1984:\nFormed an band in autumn.
