The filament is enclosed in a bulb to protect the filament from [[oxidation]].  Current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\n\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and [[voltage]] ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulating equipment]], have low [[manufacturing cost]]s, and work equally well on either [[alternating current]] or [[direct current]]. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car [[headlamp]]s, and [[flashlight]]s, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than other types of electric lighting, converting less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light.<ref name=\"incandescent\">{{cite web |title=The Nature of Light |last=Keefe |first=T.J. |year=2007 |url=http://www.ccri.edu/physics/keefe/light.htm |accessdate=2007-11-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423123823/http://www.ccri.edu/physics/keefe/light.htm |archivedate=2012-04-23}}</ref>  The remaining energy is lost as heat.

[[Heat lamp]]s are made for uses such as [[incubator (egg)|incubator]]s, [[lava lamp]]s, and the [[Easy-Bake Oven]] toy. Quartz tube lamps are used for industrial processes such as paint curing or for space heating. \n\nIncandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 20,000\u201330,000 hours for lighting LEDs. Incandescent bulbs can be replaced by [[fluorescent lamp]]s,  [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s, and [[LED lamp|light-emitting diode lamp]]s (LED). Some areas have implemented [[Phase-out of incandescent light bulbs|phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs]] to reduce energy consumption.\n\n==History==\nHistorians Robert Friedel and [[Paul Israel (historian)|Paul Israel]] list 22 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to [[Joseph Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]].{{sfnp|Friedel |Israel |2010 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8U-Naf4DuzMC&pg=PA115 115\u2013117]}} They conclude that Edison's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective [[incandescent]] material, a higher [[vacuum]] than others were able to achieve (by use of the [[Sprengel pump]]) and a high [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.\n\nHistorian Thomas Hughes has attributed Edison's success to his development of an entire, integrated system of electric lighting.\n{{quote\n|text=The lamp was a small component in his system of electric lighting, and no more critical to its effective functioning than the Edison Jumbo [[electrical generator|generator]], the Edison main and feeder, and the parallel-distribution system.

Although a workable design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use.\n\nIn 1841, Frederick de Moleyns of England was granted the first [[patent]] for an incandescent lamp, with a design using platinum wires contained within a vacuum bulb.

In 1850, he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light.

Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's [[air conditioning]] system.

Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.\n\nAn electric current heats the filament to typically {{convert|2000|to|3300|K|\u00b0C \u00b0F}}, well below tungsten's melting point of {{convert|3695|K|\u00b0C \u00b0F}}. Filament temperatures depend on the filament type, shape, size, and amount of current drawn. The heated filament emits light that approximates a [[black body|continuous spectrum]]. The useful part of the emitted energy is [[visible light]], but most energy is given off as heat in the near-[[infrared]] wavelengths.\n\n===Bulbs===\n\nMost light bulbs have either clear or coated glass. Coated glass bulbs have [[kaolin]] clay blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb. The powder layer diffuses the light from the filament. Pigments may be added to the clay to adjust the color of the  light emitted.  Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for \"party bulbs\", [[Christmas tree]] lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by [[Glass coloring and color marking|coloring the glass]] with a [[dopant]]; which is often a metal like [[cobalt]] (blue) or [[chromium]] (green).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf|title=Lamp Material Information Sheet \u2013 Incandescent Lamp|accessdate=20 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521005210/http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.\n\n{| border=\"0\"\n|\n[[File:Incandescent light bulb.svg|frameless|upright=1.25|center]]\n|\n#Outline of Glass bulb\n#Low pressure inert gas ([[argon]], [[nitrogen]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]])\n#[[Tungsten]] filament\n#Contact wire (goes out of stem)\n#Contact wire (goes into stem)\n#Support wires (one end embedded in stem; conduct no current)\n#Stem (glass mount)\n#Contact wire (goes out of stem)\n#Cap (sleeve)\n#Insulation ([[vitrite]])\n#Electrical contact\n|}\n\nThe glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between {{convert|200|and|260|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.

The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). On the other hand, the presence of the gas leads to heat loss from the filament\u2014and therefore efficiency loss due to reduced incandescence\u2014by [[heat conduction]] and [[heat convection]].\n\nEarly lamps, and some small modern lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen.

Its use is however limited by its very high cost. The improvements by using xenon are modest in comparison to its cost.\n* [[Hydrogen]], in special flashing lamps where rapid filament cooling is required; its high thermal conductivity is exploited here.\n\nThe gas fill must be free of traces of water, which greatly accelerates bulb blackening (see below).\n\nThe gas layer close to the filament (called the Langmuir layer) is stagnant, with heat transfer occurring only by conduction. Only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb's envelope.\n\nThe orientation of the filament influences efficiency. Gas flow parallel to the filament, e.g., a vertically oriented bulb with vertical (or axial) filament, reduces convective losses.\n\nThe efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter. Thin-filament, low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas, so are often only evacuated.\n\nEarly light bulbs with carbon filaments also used [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen]], or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor. However, carbon filaments operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones, so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits.\n\n==Manufacturing==\n[[File:Tantalum light bulb.png|thumb|upright|The 1902 [[tantalum]] filament light bulb was the first one to have a metal filament.

Carbon filaments have a negative [[Temperature coefficient of resistivity|temperature coefficient of resistance]]\u2014as they get hotter, their electrical resistance decreases. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. \n\nCarbon filaments were \"flashed\" by heating in a hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline), to improve their strength and uniformity. Metallized or \"graphitized\" filaments were first heated to high temperature to transform them into [[graphite]], which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. These filaments have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic [[Conductor (electrical)|conductor]], which stabilized the lamps operating properties against minor variations in supply voltage.\n\nIn 1902, [[Siemens]] developed a [[tantalum]] lamp filament that was more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments since they could operate at  higher temperature. Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports.

Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by [[William D. Coolidge]] at [[General Electric]] for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \"doping\" treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments.<ref name=tungstendoping>Chapter 2 ''The Potassium Secret Behind Tungsten Wire Production''</ref>\n\n===Coiled coil filament===\nTo improve the efficiency of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a 'coiled coil'. Light bulbs using coiled coil filaments are sometimes referred to as 'double-coil bulbs'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually {{convert|22.8|in|order=flip}},<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> and the filament diameter is {{convert|0.0018|in|order=flip}}. The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source while lasting longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.\n\nManufacturers designate different forms of lamp filament with an alphanumeric code. <ref>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978 {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, page 22-5 </ref> \n\n{{stack|\n[[File:filament.jpg|thumb|Filament of a 200-watt incandescent lightbulb highly magnified]]\n[[File:Fused Electrical Filament SEM Stereo 50x.JPG|thumb|Filament of a burnt-out 50-watt incandescent lightbulb in an [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] in stereoscopic mode, presented as an [[anaglyph image]].{{3d glasses}}]]\n[[File:Fused Electrical Filament SEM Stereo 500x.JPG|thumb|Filament of a 50-watt incandescent lightbulb in an [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] in stereoscopic mode, presented as an [[anaglyph image]].{{3d glasses}}]]\n}}\n\nElectrical filaments are also used in [[hot cathode]]s of [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s as a source of [[electron]]s or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode. When used as a source of electrons, they may have a special coating that increases electron production.\n\n===Reducing filament evaporation===\nDuring ordinary operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.\n\n[[Irving Langmuir]] found that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation. General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly [[argon]] and some [[nitrogen]],<ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-6</ref> or sometimes [[krypton]].<ref>Burgin. Lighting Research and Technology 1984 16.2 61\u201372</ref> While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. [[Xenon]] gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|title=Premium Fill Gasses|last=Lipstein|first=Don|accessdate=13 October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011122615/http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n''Filament notching'' is due to uneven evaporation of the filament. Small variations in [[electrical resistivity|resistivity]] along the filament cause \"hot spots\" to form at points of higher resistivity;<ref name=\"Kane2001\"/> a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point. This creates a [[positive feedback]] that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament. Lamps operated on direct current develop random stairstep irregularities on the filament surface which may cut lifespan in half compared to AC operation; different alloys of tungsten and [[rhenium]] can be used to counteract the effect.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miniature Lamps: Technical Information |publisher=Toshiba Lighting & Technology Corporation |url=https://www.tlt.co.jp/tlt/english/products/industrial_light/miniature_lamp/catalog/info.htm |accessdate=25 February 2019 }}</ref><ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-9</ref>\n\nSince a filament breaking in a gas-filled bulb can form an [[electric arc]], which may spread between the terminals and draw very heavy current, intentionally thin lead-in wires or more elaborate protection devices are therefore often used as [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]] built into the light bulb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teralab.co.uk/Glass_Blowing/Lamp_Autopsy/Lamp_Autopsy_Page1.htm|title=Glass Blowing for Vacuum Devices \u2013 Lamp Autopsy|last=Hunt|first=Robert|date=2001\u20132006|publisher=Teralab|accessdate=2 May 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311121008/http://www.teralab.co.uk/Glass_Blowing/Lamp_Autopsy/Lamp_Autopsy_Page1.htm|archivedate=11 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> More nitrogen is used in higher-voltage lamps to reduce the possibility of arcing.\n\n===Bulb blackening===\nIn a conventional lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening.<ref>IEC 60064 Tungsten filament lamps for domestic and similar general lighting purposes.</ref> Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the [[thermionic emission|Edison effect, thermionic emission]] and invention of the [[vacuum tube]].\n\nA very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Water vapor [[thermolysis|dissociates]] into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this ''water cycle''.<ref name=\"Kane2001\"/> The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Small amounts of substances such as [[zirconium]] are placed within the lamp as a [[getter]] to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.\n\nSome old, high-powered lamps used in theater, projection, searchlight, and lighthouse service with heavy, sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope. From time to time, the operator would remove the bulb and shake it, allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope, removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again.<ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-10</ref>\n\n===Halogen lamps===\n[[File:Tungsten filament in halogen lamp.JPG|thumb|Close-up of a tungsten filament inside a [[halogen lamp]]. The two ring-shaped structures left and right are filament supports.]]\n{{Main|Halogen lamp}}\n\nThe [[halogen lamp]] reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a [[halogen]] gas at low pressure, along with an inert gas. The [[halogen cycle]] increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]] lamps for [[optical microscopy]] is one typical application.\n\n===Incandescent arc lamps===\nA variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as [[microscope]]s. These arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an [[arc lamp]] but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and [[xenon arc lamp]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incandescent Arc Lamps|url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|publisher=Museum of Electric Lamp Technology|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801233142/http://lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|archivedate=1 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>G.

Unlike discharge lamps or LED lamps, the power consumed is equal to the [[apparent power]] in the circuit. Incandescent light bulbs are usually [[marketing|marketed]] according to the [[electric power|electrical power]] consumed.  This depends mainly on the operating  [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the filament. For two bulbs of the same voltage, and type, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.\n\nThe table shows the approximate typical output, in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]], of standard 120 volt incandescent light bulbs at various powers. Light output of similar 230&nbsp;V bulbs is slightly less. The lower current (higher voltage) filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for the same life expectancy, which reduces energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|title=Light and Lighting Fun Facts|work=donklipstein.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720233038/http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|archivedate=20 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The lumen values for \"soft white\" bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power.\n\n===Current and resistance===\nThe resistance of the filament is temperature dependent. The cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the resistance when operating. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144 [[ohm]]s when lit, but the cold resistance is much lower (about 9.5 ohms).<ref name=\"GETP110\" />{{efn|1=Edison's research team was aware of the large negative [[temperature coefficient of resistance]] of possible lamp filament materials and worked extensively during the period 1878\u20131879 on devising an automatic regulator or ''ballast'' to stabilize current. It wasn't until 1879 that it was realized a self-limiting lamp could be built.

Electrical contacts may carry a \"T\" rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps. For a 100-watt, 120-volt general-service lamp, the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds, and the lamp reaches 90% of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds.{{sfnp|Friedel|Israel|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8U-Naf4DuzMC&pg=PA22 22\u201323]}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n===Security===\nThe filament in a tungsten light bulb is not easy to break when the bulb is cold, but filaments are more vulnerable when they are hot because the incandescent metal is less rigid. An impact on the outside of the bulb may cause the filament to break or experience a surge in [[electric current]] that causes part of it to melt or vaporize.\nIn most modern incandescent bulbs, part of the wire inside the bulb acts like a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]: if a broken filament produces an [[electrical short]] inside the bulb, the fusible section of wire will melt and cut the current off to prevent damage to the supply lines.\n\nA hot glass bulb may fracture on contact with cold objects. When the glass envelope breaks, the bulb [[implosion (mechanical process)|implodes]], exposing the filament to ambient air. The air then usually destroys the hot filament through [[oxidation]].\n\n===Bulb shapes ===\n[[File:incandescent bulb shapes.svg|thumb|upright=2|Incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes.]]\nBulb shape and size designations are given in national standards.   \nSome designations are one or more letters followed by one or more numbers, e.g. A55 or PAR38, where the letters identify the shape and the numbers some characteristic size.  \n\nNational standards such as [[ANSI]] C79.1-2002, [[Indian Standard|IS]] 14897:2000<ref name=\"IS 14897:2000\">{{cite web |title=IS 14897 (2000): Glass Bulb Designation System for Lamps \u2014 Guide |publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards |location=New Delhi |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.14897.2000 |access-date=2018-07-03 |pages=1, 4 }}</ref> and [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] C 7710:1988<ref name=\"JIS C 7710:1988\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:JIS C 7710:1988 \u96fb\u7403\u985e\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u7ba1\u7403\u306e\u5f62\u5f0f\u306e\u8868\u3057\u65b9|url=http://kikakurui.com/c7/C7710-1988-01.html |accessdate=2017-03-21 |language=ja |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111224419/http://kikakurui.com/c7/C7710-1988-01.html |archivedate=11 November 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> cover a common terminology for bulb shapes.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off in applications such as traffic signal lamps. Since electric energy they use costs more than the cost of the bulb, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a [[Phoebus cartel|cartel]] agreed to limit life to 1000 hours.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Lightbulb Conspiracy |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |work=IEEE Spectrum |publisher=IEEE |first=Markus |last=Krajewski |date=24 Sep 2014 |accessdate=10 Nov 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106040631/https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |archivedate=6 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_17287091|title=Tests shine light on the secret of the Livermore light bulb|date=6 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310100846/http://www.mercurynews.com//ci_17287091|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around standard rated conditions, but they indicate that a lamp operated at low voltage could last much longer than at rated voltage, albeit with greatly reduced light output. The \"[[Centennial Light]]\" is a light bulb that is accepted by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having been burning almost continuously at a [[fire station]] in [[Livermore, California]], since 1901. However, the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb. A similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in Texas that has been illuminated since 21 September 1908. It once resided in an [[opera house]] where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow, and was moved to an area museum in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |title=Watts Up? \u2013 A parting look at lighting|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207211654/http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |archivedate=7 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nFlood lamps used for photographic lighting favor light output over life, with some lasting only two hours. The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, {{convert|3695|K|\u00b0C \u00b0F}}. A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.<ref name=\"GETP110\" />\n\nLamps of the same power rating but designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 1000 hour, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt. A similar lamp designed for 230&nbsp;V would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt, and one designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.\n\nThe wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger, but remove heat, creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life. Many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires, but lamps designed for \"[[rough service]]\" or \"vibration service\" may have as many as five. Low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires.\n\nVery low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Livermore Centennial Light Bulb.jpg|The [[Centennial Light]] is the longest-lasting light bulb in the world.\nFile:Various lighting spectrums - Flurescent incandescent diode and candle.jpg|Various lighting spectra as viewed in a [[diffraction grating]].

A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems.

Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.\n\nAn electric current heats the filament to typically {{convert|2000|to|3300|K|\u00b0C \u00b0F}}, well below tungsten's melting point of {{convert|3695|K|\u00b0C \u00b0F}}. Filament temperatures depend on the filament type, shape, size, and amount of current drawn. The heated filament emits light that approximates a [[black body|continuous spectrum]]. The useful part of the emitted energy is [[visible light]], but most energy is given off as heat in the near-[[infrared]] wavelengths.\n\n===Bulbs===\n\nMost light bulbs have either clear or coated glass. Coated glass bulbs have [[kaolin]] clay blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb. The powder layer diffuses the light from the filament. Pigments may be added to the clay to adjust the color of the  light emitted.  Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for \"party bulbs\", [[Christmas tree]] lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by [[Glass coloring and color marking|coloring the glass]] with a [[dopant]]; which is often a metal like [[cobalt]] (blue) or [[chromium]] (green).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf|title=Lamp Material Information Sheet \u2013 Incandescent Lamp|accessdate=20 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521005210/http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.\n\n{| border=\"0\"\n|\n[[File:Incandescent light bulb.svg|frameless|upright=1.25|center]]\n|\n#Outline of Glass bulb\n#Low pressure inert gas ([[argon]], [[nitrogen]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]])\n#[[Tungsten]] filament\n#Contact wire (goes out of stem)\n#Contact wire (goes into stem)\n#Support wires (one end embedded in stem; conduct no current)\n#Stem (glass mount)\n#Contact wire (goes out of stem)\n#Cap (sleeve)\n#Insulation ([[vitrite]])\n#Electrical contact\n|}\n\nThe glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between {{convert|200|and|260|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.

The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). On the other hand, the presence of the gas leads to heat loss from the filament\u2014and therefore efficiency loss due to reduced incandescence\u2014by [[heat conduction]] and [[heat convection]].\n\nEarly lamps, and some small modern lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen.

Its use is however limited by its very high cost. The improvements by using xenon are modest in comparison to its cost.\n* [[Hydrogen]], in special flashing lamps where rapid filament cooling is required; its high thermal conductivity is exploited here.\n\nThe gas fill must be free of traces of water, which greatly accelerates bulb blackening (see below).\n\nThe gas layer close to the filament (called the Langmuir layer) is stagnant, with heat transfer occurring only by conduction. Only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb's envelope.\n\nThe orientation of the filament influences efficiency. Gas flow parallel to the filament, e.g., a vertically oriented bulb with vertical (or axial) filament, reduces convective losses.\n\nThe efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter. Thin-filament, low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas, so are often only evacuated.\n\nEarly light bulbs with carbon filaments also used [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen]], or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor. However, carbon filaments operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones, so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits.\n\n==Manufacturing==\n[[File:Tantalum light bulb.png|thumb|upright|The 1902 [[tantalum]] filament light bulb was the first one to have a metal filament.

Carbon filaments have a negative [[Temperature coefficient of resistivity|temperature coefficient of resistance]]\u2014as they get hotter, their electrical resistance decreases. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. \n\nCarbon filaments were \"flashed\" by heating in a hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline), to improve their strength and uniformity. Metallized or \"graphitized\" filaments were first heated to high temperature to transform them into [[graphite]], which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. These filaments have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic [[Conductor (electrical)|conductor]], which stabilized the lamps operating properties against minor variations in supply voltage.\n\nIn 1902, [[Siemens]] developed a [[tantalum]] lamp filament that was more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments since they could operate at  higher temperature. Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports. The metal filament gradually shortened in use; the filaments were installed with large slack loops. Lamps used for several hundred hours becasme quite fragile.<ref>I. C. S. Reference Library Volume 4B, Scranton, [[International Textbook Company]], 1908, no ISBN</ref> Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament.

Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by [[William D. Coolidge]] at [[General Electric]] for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \"doping\" treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments.<ref name=tungstendoping>Chapter 2 ''The Potassium Secret Behind Tungsten Wire Production''</ref>\n\n===Coiled coil filament===\nTo improve the efficiency of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a 'coiled coil'. Light bulbs using coiled coil filaments are sometimes referred to as 'double-coil bulbs'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually {{convert|22.8|in|order=flip}},<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> and the filament diameter is {{convert|0.0018|in|order=flip}}. The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source while lasting longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.\n\nManufacturers designate different forms of lamp filament with an alphanumeric code. <ref>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1978 {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, page 22-5 </ref> \n\n{{stack|\n[[File:filament.jpg|thumb|Filament of a 200-watt incandescent lightbulb highly magnified]]\n[[File:Fused Electrical Filament SEM Stereo 50x.JPG|thumb|Filament of a burnt-out 50-watt incandescent lightbulb in an [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] in stereoscopic mode, presented as an [[anaglyph image]].{{3d glasses}}]]\n[[File:Fused Electrical Filament SEM Stereo 500x.JPG|thumb|Filament of a 50-watt incandescent lightbulb in an [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] in stereoscopic mode, presented as an [[anaglyph image]].{{3d glasses}}]]\n}}\n\nElectrical filaments are also used in [[hot cathode]]s of [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s as a source of [[electron]]s or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode. When used as a source of electrons, they may have a special coating that increases electron production.\n\n===Reducing filament evaporation===\nDuring ordinary operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.\n\n[[Irving Langmuir]] found that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation. General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly [[argon]] and some [[nitrogen]],<ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-6</ref> or sometimes [[krypton]].<ref>Burgin. Lighting Research and Technology 1984 16.2 61\u201372</ref> While inert gas reduces filament evaporation, it also conducts heat from the filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. [[Xenon]] gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|title=Premium Fill Gasses|last=Lipstein|first=Don|accessdate=13 October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011122615/http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n''Filament notching'' is due to uneven evaporation of the filament.

This creates a [[positive feedback]] that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament.

For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening.<ref>IEC 60064 Tungsten filament lamps for domestic and similar general lighting purposes.</ref> Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the [[thermionic emission|Edison effect, thermionic emission]] and invention of the [[vacuum tube]].\n\nA very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Water vapor [[thermolysis|dissociates]] into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this ''water cycle''.<ref name=\"Kane2001\"/> The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Small amounts of substances such as [[zirconium]] are placed within the lamp as a [[getter]] to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.\n\nSome old, high-powered lamps used in theater, projection, searchlight, and lighthouse service with heavy, sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope. From time to time, the operator would remove the bulb and shake it, allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope, removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again.<ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 {{ISBN|0-87995-007-2}} page 8-10</ref>\n\n===Halogen lamps===\n[[File:Tungsten filament in halogen lamp.JPG|thumb|Close-up of a tungsten filament inside a [[halogen lamp]]. The two ring-shaped structures left and right are filament supports.]]\n{{Main|Halogen lamp}}\n\nThe [[halogen lamp]] reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a [[halogen]] gas at low pressure, along with an inert gas. The [[halogen cycle]] increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]] lamps for [[optical microscopy]] is one typical application.\n\n===Incandescent arc lamps===\nA variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as [[microscope]]s. These arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an [[arc lamp]] but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and [[xenon arc lamp]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incandescent Arc Lamps|url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|publisher=Museum of Electric Lamp Technology|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801233142/http://lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|archivedate=1 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>G.

Unlike discharge lamps or LED lamps, the power consumed is equal to the [[apparent power]] in the circuit. Incandescent light bulbs are usually [[marketing|marketed]] according to the [[electric power|electrical power]] consumed.  This depends mainly on the operating  [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the filament. For two bulbs of the same voltage, and type, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.\n\nThe table shows the approximate typical output, in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]], of standard 120 volt incandescent light bulbs at various powers. Light output of similar 230&nbsp;V bulbs is slightly less. The lower current (higher voltage) filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for the same life expectancy, which reduces energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|title=Light and Lighting Fun Facts|work=donklipstein.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720233038/http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|archivedate=20 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The lumen values for \"soft white\" bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power.\n\n===Current and resistance===\nThe resistance of the filament is temperature dependent. The cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the resistance when operating. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144 [[ohm]]s when lit, but the cold resistance is much lower (about 9.5 ohms).<ref name=\"GETP110\" />{{efn|1=Edison's research team was aware of the large negative [[temperature coefficient of resistance]] of possible lamp filament materials and worked extensively during the period 1878\u20131879 on devising an automatic regulator or ''ballast'' to stabilize current. It wasn't until 1879 that it was realized a self-limiting lamp could be built.

Electrical contacts may carry a \"T\" rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps. For a 100-watt, 120-volt general-service lamp, the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds, and the lamp reaches 90% of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds.{{sfnp|Friedel|Israel|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8U-Naf4DuzMC&pg=PA22 22\u201323]}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n===Security===\nThe filament in a tungsten light bulb is not easy to break when the bulb is cold, but filaments are more vulnerable when they are hot because the incandescent metal is less rigid. An impact on the outside of the bulb may cause the filament to break or experience a surge in [[electric current]] that causes part of it to melt or vaporize.\nIn most modern incandescent bulbs, part of the wire inside the bulb acts like a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]: if a broken filament produces an [[electrical short]] inside the bulb, the fusible section of wire will melt and cut the current off to prevent damage to the supply lines.\n\nA hot glass bulb may fracture on contact with cold objects. When the glass envelope breaks, the bulb [[implosion (mechanical process)|implodes]], exposing the filament to ambient air. The air then usually destroys the hot filament through [[oxidation]].\n\n===Bulb shapes ===\n[[File:incandescent bulb shapes.svg|thumb|upright=2|Incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes.]]\nBulb shape and size designations are given in national standards.   \nSome designations are one or more letters followed by one or more numbers, e.g. A55 or PAR38, where the letters identify the shape and the numbers some characteristic size.  \n\nNational standards such as [[ANSI]] C79.1-2002, [[Indian Standard|IS]] 14897:2000<ref name=\"IS 14897:2000\">{{cite web |title=IS 14897 (2000): Glass Bulb Designation System for Lamps \u2014 Guide |publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards |location=New Delhi |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.14897.2000 |access-date=2018-07-03 |pages=1, 4 }}</ref> and [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] C 7710:1988<ref name=\"JIS C 7710:1988\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:JIS C 7710:1988 \u96fb\u7403\u985e\u30ac\u30e9\u30b9\u7ba1\u7403\u306e\u5f62\u5f0f\u306e\u8868\u3057\u65b9|url=http://kikakurui.com/c7/C7710-1988-01.html |accessdate=2017-03-21 |language=ja |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111224419/http://kikakurui.com/c7/C7710-1988-01.html |archivedate=11 November 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> cover a common terminology for bulb shapes.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

A screw-base lamp may have a random orientation of the filament when the lamp is installed in the socket.\n\nContacts in the [[lightbulb socket]] allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament. The socket provides electrical connections and mechanical support, and allows changing the lamp when it burns out.\n\n==Light output and lifetime==\n{{See also|Lamp rerating}}\nIncandescent lamps are very sensitive to changes in the supply voltage.

Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off in applications such as traffic signal lamps. Since electric energy they use costs more than the cost of the bulb, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a [[Phoebus cartel|cartel]] agreed to limit life to 1000 hours.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Lightbulb Conspiracy |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |work=IEEE Spectrum |publisher=IEEE |first=Markus |last=Krajewski |date=24 Sep 2014 |accessdate=10 Nov 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106040631/https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |archivedate=6 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_17287091|title=Tests shine light on the secret of the Livermore light bulb|date=6 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310100846/http://www.mercurynews.com//ci_17287091|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around standard rated conditions, but they indicate that a lamp operated at low voltage could last much longer than at rated voltage, albeit with greatly reduced light output. The \"[[Centennial Light]]\" is a light bulb that is accepted by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having been burning almost continuously at a [[fire station]] in [[Livermore, California]], since 1901. However, the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb. A similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in Texas that has been illuminated since 21 September 1908. It once resided in an [[opera house]] where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow, and was moved to an area museum in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |title=Watts Up? \u2013 A parting look at lighting|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207211654/http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |archivedate=7 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nFlood lamps used for photographic lighting favor light output over life, with some lasting only two hours. The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, {{convert|3695|K|\u00b0C \u00b0F}}. A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only {{convert|50|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.<ref name=\"GETP110\" />\n\nLamps of the same power rating but designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 1000 hour, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt. A similar lamp designed for 230&nbsp;V would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt, and one designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.\n\nThe wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger, but remove heat, creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life. Many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires, but lamps designed for \"[[rough service]]\" or \"vibration service\" may have as many as five. Low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires.\n\nVery low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts.

The film, which also serves as a direct sequel to the [[The Shining (film)|film adaptation]] of ''The Shining'', directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], is set several decades after the events of the original and combines elements of the 1977 novel as well.

Writer-producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] wrote a script, but the studio did not secure a budget for the film until the box office success of its 2017 horror film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', also based on a novel by King. Flanagan was hired to rewrite Goldsman's script and direct the film. Flanagan said the film would try and reconcile the differences between ''The Shining'' novel and film. Filming began in September 2018 in Georgia, including [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and the surrounding area, and concluded in December 2018.\n\nWarner Bros.

After stealing money from a single mother, following a one-night stand, he realizes he has [[Hitting rock bottom|hit rock bottom]]. He moves to a small New Hampshire town and befriends Billy Freeman, who finds him an apartment and becomes his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sponsor. Rehabilitating, Dan becomes a hospice orderly. He uses his shining to comfort dying patients, who nickname him \"Doctor Sleep\". He also begins receiving telepathic communications from Abra Stone, a young girl whose shining is even more powerful than his. Meanwhile, Rose and her lover, Crow Daddy, observe a teenager named Snakebite Andi who has the ability to psychically control individuals. They later recruit Andi into the True Knot after feeding her the steam of Violet, a young girl who the cult murdered at the start of the film.\n\nIn 2019, the True Knot are starving as the steam has become increasingly rare. They abduct a young boy, Bradley, and torture him to death for his steam. A teenage Abra senses the event, and her distress alerts both Dan and Rose. Rose sets her sights on Abra, planning to extract her steam. Realizing the danger, Abra visits Dan in person and tells him she can track the cult if she touches Bradley's baseball glove. Dan refuses to help, telling her to suppress her shining to stay safe. That night, Rose [[Astral projection|projects her consciousness]] across the country and infiltrates Abra's mind but finds that Abra has set an imaginary trap, which injures Rose. After cult member Grandpa Flick dies of starvation, Rose sends the remaining members after Abra.\n\nHallorann visits Dan a final time, telling him to protect Abra as Hallorann once protected him. Dan tells Billy about the True Knot. They travel to the murder scene and exhume Bradley's body to retrieve his glove. They recruit Abra's father, Dave, and have him guard Abra's body as she projects herself to a local campsite, luring the cult there. Dan and Billy shoot most of them dead, though a dying Andi compels Billy into suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Crow Daddy kills Dave and abducts Abra, drugging her to suppress her shining. Dan telepathically contacts Abra, who lets him possess her, and manipulates Crow into crashing his car, killing him and freeing Abra. While Dan and Abra reunite, Rose consumes the cult's remaining stockpile of steam, healing her wounds and vowing revenge. As a last resort, Dan brings Abra to the Overlook, believing it will be as dangerous for Rose as it is for them. He starts the hotel's boiler and explores the dormant building, \"awakening\" it with his shining. He revisits the rooms where his alcoholic father, Jack, influenced by the Overlook, attempted to murder him and Wendy. At the hotel bar, Dan is greeted by \"Lloyd\", a ghostly bartender who strongly resembles [[Jack Torrance]]. The apparition attempts to tempt Dan into drinking again, but Dan ultimately declines.\n\nRose arrives at the Overlook. Dan and Abra pull her consciousness into Dan's mind, which resembles the Overlook's endless hedge maze. Dan tries to trap her in an imaginary box but fails. Rose, attracted by Dan's shining, invites him to join the cult, but he refuses. When she overpowers him and begins consuming his steam, Dan opens the boxes, releasing the Overlook's hungry ghosts from his mind. Rose, being a psychic vampire, is vulnerable to direct attacks by the ghosts. They brutally kill her, consuming her steam and then possessing Dan. He and the ghosts pursue Abra to Room 237. She tells the hotel that Dan sabotaged the boiler. Dan, regaining momentary control, tells her to flee. Possessed, he rushes to the boiler room but regains control before the hotel can make him deactivate it. Flames engulf the room. In his last moment, Dan sees a vision of himself as a child being embraced by his mother, Wendy. Abra watches helplessly as the hotel burns down just as the authorities approach.\n\nSometime later, Abra talks to Dan's spirit\u2014they assure each other that they will both be okay, and Dan disappears. Abra's mother learns to adjust with her daughter's powers, especially in communicating with the spirit of her deceased husband. As her mother leaves the room, Abra notices the ghost of the rotting woman from the Overlook is in the bathroom and prepares to lock the ghost up just as Danny did.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Danny Torrance|Danny \"Dan\" Torrance]], an alcoholic man with psychic powers known as \"the shining\".

Lloyd had been retired from acting for roughly 38 years, and was direct-messaged on [[Twitter]] by Flanagan to appear in the film. Producer Trevor Macy said of Lloyd's involvement, \"[Lloyd] was excited to do [the cameo]. He hadn't acted since [the original]. He's a schoolteacher, and a very successful one at that, like making the world better. He came back for a day, and we were thrilled to have him.\" When pressed as to why the filmmakers did not extend the same offer to Jack Nicholson, Macy responded, \"With Jack, I knew that they approached him for ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'', and that he seems to be very serious about being retired. I had known that he was supportive [of the sequel] but retired.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/doctor-sleep-the-shining-cameo-danny-lloyd-1203388429/ | title=How 'Doctor Sleep' Filmmakers Pulled off That 'Shining' Cameo| date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the recast characters, Flanagan explained, \"We explored everything, and there were only really two options as I saw it: It was either going to be something that was performed, or something that was digital. And even if we had Nicholson come back, based on the rules of the hotel and how the ghosts appear with respect to their age, he'd be performing the part through a digital avatar.\" Flanagan said that de-aging and digital actors, while improving rapidly, were still inadequate. \"The idea of having a digital Danny Torrance riding a trike five minutes into the movie, that just seemed like we were making a video game at that point. It felt disrespectful.\" Noting that any solution would be controversial, the director decided that the best approach \"was not to do impressions; it was to find actors who would remind us of those iconic performances, without ever tipping into parody... I just want to be able to tilt people's memories toward those original actors, but then let the characters be their own. I want to cast someone to play Dick Hallorann; I don't want to cast someone to play Scatman Crothers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shining-sequel-doctor-sleep-a-spooky-as-hell-tribute-to-stanley-kubrick-and-stephen-king|title=Inside \u2018The Shining\u2019 Sequel \u2018Doctor Sleep\u2019: A Spooky-as-Hell Tribute to Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King}}</ref> The idea of casting a Nicholson impersonator as Jack was also considered, as was casting a big-name actor associated with or reminiscent of Nicholson, such as [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] or [[Christian Slater]].

Writer-producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] wrote a script, but the studio did not secure a budget for the film until the box office success of its 2017 horror film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', also based on a novel by King.

After stealing money from a single mother, following a one-night stand, he realizes he has [[Hitting rock bottom|hit rock bottom]]. He moves to a small New Hampshire town and befriends Billy Freeman, who finds him an apartment and becomes his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sponsor. Rehabilitating, Dan becomes a hospice orderly. He uses his shining to comfort dying patients, who nickname him \"Doctor Sleep\". He also begins receiving telepathic communications from Abra Stone, a young girl whose shining is even more powerful than his. Meanwhile, Rose and her lover, Crow Daddy, observe a teenager named Snakebite Andi who has the ability to psychically control individuals. They later recruit Andi into the True Knot after feeding her the steam of Violet, a young girl who the cult murdered at the start of the film.\n\nIn 2019, the True Knot are starving as the steam has become increasingly rare. They abduct a young boy, Bradley, and torture him to death for his steam. A teenage Abra senses the event, and her distress alerts both Dan and Rose. Rose sets her sights on Abra, planning to extract her steam. Realizing the danger, Abra visits Dan in person and tells him she can track the cult if she touches Bradley's baseball glove. Dan refuses to help, telling her to suppress her shining to stay safe. That night, Rose [[Astral projection|projects her consciousness]] across the country and infiltrates Abra's mind but finds that Abra has set an imaginary trap, which injures Rose. After cult member Grandpa Flick dies of starvation, Rose sends the remaining members after Abra.\n\nHallorann visits Dan a final time, telling him to protect Abra as Hallorann once protected him. Dan tells Billy about the True Knot. They travel to the murder scene and exhume Bradley's body to retrieve his glove. They recruit Abra's father, Dave, and have him guard Abra's body as she projects herself to a local campsite, luring the cult there. Dan and Billy shoot most of them dead, though a dying Andi compels Billy into suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Crow Daddy kills Dave and abducts Abra, drugging her to suppress her shining. Dan telepathically contacts Abra, who lets him possess her, and manipulates Crow into crashing his car, killing him and freeing Abra. While Dan and Abra reunite, Rose consumes the cult's remaining stockpile of steam, healing her wounds and vowing revenge. As a last resort, Dan brings Abra to the Overlook, believing it will be as dangerous for Rose as it is for them. He starts the hotel's boiler and explores the dormant building, \"awakening\" it with his shining. He revisits the rooms where his alcoholic father, Jack, influenced by the Overlook, attempted to murder him and Wendy. At the hotel bar, Dan is greeted by \"Lloyd\", a ghostly bartender who strongly resembles [[Jack Torrance]]. The apparition attempts to tempt Dan into drinking again, but Dan ultimately declines.\n\nRose arrives at the Overlook. Dan and Abra pull her consciousness into Dan's mind, which resembles the Overlook's endless hedge maze. Dan tries to trap her in an imaginary box but fails. Rose, attracted by Dan's shining, invites him to join the cult, but he refuses. When she overpowers him and begins consuming his steam, Dan opens the boxes, releasing the Overlook's hungry ghosts from his mind. Rose, being a psychic vampire, is vulnerable to direct attacks by the ghosts. They brutally kill her, consuming her steam and then possessing Dan. He and the ghosts pursue Abra to Room 237. She tells the hotel that Dan sabotaged the boiler. Dan, regaining momentary control, tells her to flee. Possessed, he rushes to the boiler room but regains control before the hotel can make him deactivate it. Flames engulf the room. In his last moment, Dan sees a vision of himself as a child being embraced by his mother, Wendy. Abra watches helplessly as the hotel burns down just as the authorities approach.\n\nSometime later, Abra talks to Dan's spirit\u2014they assure each other that they will both be okay, and Dan disappears. Abra's mother learns to adjust with her daughter's powers, especially in communicating with the spirit of her deceased husband. As her mother leaves the room, Abra notices the ghost of the rotting woman from the Overlook is in the bathroom and prepares to lock the ghost up just as Danny did.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Danny Torrance|Danny \"Dan\" Torrance]], an alcoholic man with psychic powers known as \"the shining\".

He's a schoolteacher, and a very successful one at that, like making the world better. He came back for a day, and we were thrilled to have him.\" When pressed as to why the filmmakers did not extend the same offer to Jack Nicholson, Macy responded, \"With Jack, I knew that they approached him for ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'', and that he seems to be very serious about being retired.

And even if we had Nicholson come back, based on the rules of the hotel and how the ghosts appear with respect to their age, he'd be performing the part through a digital avatar.\" Flanagan said that de-aging and digital actors, while improving rapidly, were still inadequate. \"The idea of having a digital Danny Torrance riding a trike five minutes into the movie, that just seemed like we were making a video game at that point. It felt disrespectful.\" Noting that any solution would be controversial, the director decided that the best approach \"was not to do impressions; it was to find actors who would remind us of those iconic performances, without ever tipping into parody... I just want to be able to tilt people's memories toward those original actors, but then let the characters be their own.
