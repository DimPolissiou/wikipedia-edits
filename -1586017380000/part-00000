By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown: number '2012' on 26 July 2014, number '2013' on 29 November 2014 and finally number '2015' on 19 December 2014.\n\nOn 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked '2016', began testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently changed [[diverterless supersonic inlet|DSI bumps]] on the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian [[AL-31]] or Chinese [[Shenyang WS-10]] turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18\u201319 ton [[WS-15]] engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards facing radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \"2014\" and \"2015\" predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.popsci.com/stealthier-stealth-seventh-upgraded-chinese-stealth-fighter-prototype-aims-to-take-flight | title = Stealthier stealth: seventh upgraded Chinese stealth fighter prototype aims to take flight | newspaper = Popular sciende}}.</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered '2017', took to the sky.

By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown: number '2012' on 26 July 2014, number '2013' on 29 November 2014 and finally number '2015' on 19 December 2014.\n\nOn 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked '2016', began testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently changed [[diverterless supersonic inlet|DSI bumps]] on the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian [[AL-31]] or Chinese [[Shenyang WS-10]] turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18\u201319 ton [[WS-15]] engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards facing radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \"2014\" and \"2015\" predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.popsci.com/stealthier-stealth-seventh-upgraded-chinese-stealth-fighter-prototype-aims-to-take-flight | title = Stealthier stealth: seventh upgraded Chinese stealth fighter prototype aims to take flight | newspaper = Popular sciende}}.</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered '2017', took to the sky. The most significant change in the new prototype is the reshaped cockpit canopy, which provides the pilot with greater visibility. The lack of other design changes suggest that \"2017\" is very close to the final J-20 production configuration. Since '2017' is likely the last J-20 prototype, low rate initial production of the J-20 is likely to begin in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/2017-prototype-heralds-end-an-era-for-j-20-fighter-jet-testing-start-another-era|title=China Is Building The World's Second Stealth Air Force|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> It has been reported that the design of J-20 is already mature and will not directly use the 117S engine.<ref name= \"mil.news.sina.com.cn\">{{Citation |contribution = Mil |title = News |publisher = Sina |date = 25 November 2015 |contribution-url = http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2015-11-25/0848844774.html}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 2017 there were still a series of technical problems that needed to be tackled, including the reliability of its WS-15 engines, the aircraft's flight control system, stealth coatings and hull materials, and infrared sensor.<ref name=\"Johnson_2017-03-16\">{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Reuben F. |url=http://www.janes.com/article/68755/chengdu-j-20-has-entered-service-claims-chinese-media |title=Chengdu J-20 has 'entered service', claims Chinese media |website=Jane's 360 |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316140730/http://www.janes.com/article/68755/chengdu-j-20-has-entered-service-claims-chinese-media |archive-date=16 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nIn late December 2015, a new J-20 numbered 2101 was spotted; it is believed to be the [[Low rate initial production|LRIP]] version of the aircraft.<ref name=\"j20_lrip\">{{cite web |url= http://plarealtalk.com/2016/01/27/j-20-first-lrip-airframe-maiden-flight-serial-number-2101/ |title= J-20 first LRIP airframe maiden flight (serial number 2101) |date=27 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, Chinese media reported that [[Chengdu Aerospace Corporation]] (CAC) initiated a series production for the J-20 and is on a path towards achieving full operational capability with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/75232/china-s-j-20-fifth-gen-fighter-moves-into-series-production |title= China's J-20 fifth-gen fighter moves into series production  |publisher=Jane's 360 |date=26 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/chinas-first-5th-generation-fighter-moves-into-serial-production/ |title= China\u2019s First 5th Generation Fighter Moves into Serial Production  |magazine=The Diplomat |date=31 October 2017}}</ref> Initially, the lack of a suitable indigenously produced engine hindered the mass production of the J-20, however in September 2018, it was reported that issues with the development of the WS-15 engine, particularly the reliability of the turbine blades overheating at top speeds are fixed and after further minor refinements it should be ready for widespread installation by the end of 2018.<ref>{{cite news| last = Chan| first = Minnie| title = China 'nearing mass production' of J-20 stealth fighter after engine problems ironed out| work = South China Morning Post| date = 5 September 2018| url = https://m.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2162765/china-nearing-mass-production-j-20-stealth-fighter-after-engine?amp=1| accessdate = 14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Deployment===\nAt least six J-20s are in active service, with tail numbers 78271-78276 identified.

The rebels took over most of the province by late 2013, leaving only small pockets of government control around the city of Deir ez-Zor.\n\nSince late 2013, ISIS became increasingly involved in the battle, but retreated tactically in February 2014. Still, in April 2014, ISIS launched a massive offensive, taking over all rebel areas. Heavy fighting continued in the city over the following years between government troops and ISIS.

The rebels took over most of the province by late 2013, leaving only small pockets of government control around the city of Deir ez-Zor.\n\nSince late 2013, ISIS became increasingly involved in the battle, but retreated tactically in February 2014. Still, in April 2014, ISIS launched a massive offensive, taking over all rebel areas. Heavy fighting continued in the city over the following years between government troops and ISIS. By mid-November 2016, it was reported that since the start of the fighting in Deir ez-Zor city five years earlier, around 3,000 anti-government jihadists and 2,500 pro-government fighters had been killed.

He was mainly a portraitist but also painted many religious subjects, and a few allegorical subjects, which include what is probably his best known work, ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', c. 1544\u201345, now in London. Many portraits of the Medicis exist in several versions with varying degrees of participation by Bronzino himself, as Cosimo was a pioneer of the copied portrait sent as a diplomatic gift. \n\nHe trained with [[Pontormo]], the leading Florentine painter of the first generation of Mannerism, and his style was greatly influenced by him, but his elegant and somewhat elongated figures always appear calm and somewhat reserved, lacking the agitation and emotion of those by his teacher. They have often been found cold and artificial, and his reputation suffered from the general critical disfavour attached to Mannerism in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Recent decades have been more appreciative of his art.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', c. 1544\u201345, London, [[National Gallery]]]]\nBronzino was born in [[Florence]], the son of a butcher. According to his contemporary [[Vasari]], Bronzino was a pupil first of [[Raffaellino del Garbo]], and then of [[Pontormo]], to whom he was apprenticed at 14. Pontormo is thought to have introduced a [[portrait]] of Bronzino as a child (seated on a step) into one of his series on ''[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph in Egypt]]'' now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[London]].<ref>Elizabeth Pilliod, ''Pontormo, Bronzino, and Allori: A Genealogy of Florentine Art'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001).</ref> Pontormo exercised a dominant influence on Bronzino's developing [[Painting style|style]], and the two were to remain collaborators for most of the former's life. An early example of Bronzino's hand has often been detected in the [[Capponi Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Felicita]] by the [[Ponte Vecchio]] in Florence. Pontormo designed the interior and executed the altarpiece, the masterly [[The Deposition from the Cross (Pontormo)|''Deposition from the Cross'']] and the sidewall fresco ''[[Annunciation (Pontormo)|Annunciation]]''. Bronzino apparently was assigned the frescoes on the dome, which have not survived. Of the four empanelled ''tondi'' or roundels depicting each of the [[Evangelism|evangelists]], two were said by Vasari to have been painted by Bronzino. His style is so similar to his master's that scholars still debate the specific attributions.<ref>[http://www.wga.hu/index1.html Web Gallery of Art, image collection, virtual museum, searchable database of European fine arts (1100\u20131850)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, Bronzino took a prominent part in the activities of the Florentine [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]], of which he was a founding member in 1563.\n\nThe painter [[Alessandro Allori]] was his favourite pupil, and Bronzino was living in the Allori family house at the time of his death in Florence in 1572 (Alessandro was also the father of [[Cristofano Allori]]).<ref name=\"NG\">Cecil Gould, ''The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools, National Gallery Catalogues'', (London 1975), {{ISBN|0-947645-22-5}}</ref> Bronzino spent the majority of his career in Florence.\n\n[[File:Bronzino - Eleonora di Toledo col figlio Giovanni - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of Eleanor of Toledo|Eleonora di Toledo col figlio Giovanni]]'', 1544\u201345, oil on wood, [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\n\n==Work==\n\n===Portraits===\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Portrait of a Young Man.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Young Man'', c. 1550\u201355, London, National Gallery]]\n\nBronzino first received Medici patronage in 1539, when he was one of the many artists chosen to execute the elaborate decorations for the wedding of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]] to [[Eleonora di Toledo]], daughter of the [[Viceroy of Naples]]. It was not long before he became, and remained for most of his career, the official court painter of the Duke and his court. His portrait figures\u2014often read as static, elegant, and stylish exemplars of unemotional haughtiness and assurance\u2014influenced the course of European court portraiture for a century. These well known paintings exist in many workshop versions and copies. In addition to images of the Florentine elite, Bronzino also painted idealized portraits of the [[poet]]s [[Dante]] (c. 1530, now in [[National Gallery of Art|Washington, DC]]) and [[Petrarch]].\n\nBronzino's best known works comprise the aforementioned series of the duke and duchess, [[portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici|Cosimo]] and [[portrait of Eleonora di Toledo|Eleonora]], and figures of their court such as Bartolomeo  Panciatichi and his wife [[portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi|Lucrezia]]. These paintings, especially those of the duchess, are known for their minute attention to the detail of her costume, which almost takes on a personality of its own in the image at right.  Here the Duchess is pictured with her second son Giovanni, who died of malaria in 1562, along with his mother; however it is the sumptuous fabric of the dress that takes up more space on the canvas than either of the sitters.  Indeed, the dress itself has been the object of some scholarly debate.

Before this commission, his style in the religious genre was less Mannerist, and was based in balanced compositions of the High Renaissance. Yet he became elegant and classicizing (cf. [[Craig Hugh Smyth|Smyth]]) in this fresco cycle, and his religious works are examples of the mid-16th-century aesthetics of the Florentine court\u2014traditionally interpreted as highly stylized and non-personal or emotive.  ''[[Crossing the Red Sea (Bronzino)|Crossing the Red Sea]]'' is typical of Bronzino's approach at this time, though it should not be claimed that Bronzino or the court was lacking in religious fervor on the basis of the preferred court fashion.  Indeed, the [[duchess]] Eleanora was a generous patron to the recently founded [[Jesuit]] order.<ref>Janet Cox-Rearick, ''Bronzino's Chapel of Eleonora in the Palazzo Vecchio'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993).</ref>\n\nBronzino's work tends to include sophisticated references to earlier painters, as in one of his last grand frescoes called ''The Martyrdom of St. Lawrence'' (San Lorenzo, 1569), in which almost every one of the extraordinarily contorted poses can be traced back to [[Raphael]] or to [[Michelangelo]], whom Bronzino idolized (cf. Brock).  Bronzino's skill with the [[nude]] was even more enigmatically deployed in the celebrated ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', which conveys strong feelings of [[eroticism]] under the pretext of a moralizing [[allegory]]. His other major works include the design of a series of [[tapestries]] on ''[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|The Story of Joseph]]'', for the Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nMany of Bronzino's works are still in Florence but other examples can be found in the [[National Gallery, London]], and elsewhere.\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino 055.jpg|thumbnail|''Lodovico Capponi'']]\n <!-- [[File:Angelo Bronzino

He was mainly a portraitist but also painted many religious subjects, and a few allegorical subjects, which include what is probably his best known work, ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', c. 1544\u201345, now in London. Many portraits of the Medicis exist in several versions with varying degrees of participation by Bronzino himself, as Cosimo was a pioneer of the copied portrait sent as a diplomatic gift. \n\nHe trained with [[Pontormo]], the leading Florentine painter of the first generation of Mannerism, and his style was greatly influenced by him, but his elegant and somewhat elongated figures always appear calm and somewhat reserved, lacking the agitation and emotion of those by his teacher. They have often been found cold and artificial, and his reputation suffered from the general critical disfavour attached to Mannerism in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Recent decades have been more appreciative of his art.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', c. 1544\u201345, London, [[National Gallery]]]]\nBronzino was born in [[Florence]], the son of a butcher. According to his contemporary [[Vasari]], Bronzino was a pupil first of [[Raffaellino del Garbo]], and then of [[Pontormo]], to whom he was apprenticed at 14. Pontormo is thought to have introduced a [[portrait]] of Bronzino as a child (seated on a step) into one of his series on ''[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph in Egypt]]'' now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[London]].<ref>Elizabeth Pilliod, ''Pontormo, Bronzino, and Allori: A Genealogy of Florentine Art'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001).</ref> Pontormo exercised a dominant influence on Bronzino's developing [[Painting style|style]], and the two were to remain collaborators for most of the former's life. An early example of Bronzino's hand has often been detected in the [[Capponi Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Felicita]] by the [[Ponte Vecchio]] in Florence. Pontormo designed the interior and executed the altarpiece, the masterly [[The Deposition from the Cross (Pontormo)|''Deposition from the Cross'']] and the sidewall fresco ''[[Annunciation (Pontormo)|Annunciation]]''. Bronzino apparently was assigned the frescoes on the dome, which have not survived. Of the four empanelled ''tondi'' or roundels depicting each of the [[Evangelism|evangelists]], two were said by Vasari to have been painted by Bronzino. His style is so similar to his master's that scholars still debate the specific attributions.<ref>[http://www.wga.hu/index1.html Web Gallery of Art, image collection, virtual museum, searchable database of European fine arts (1100\u20131850)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, Bronzino took a prominent part in the activities of the Florentine [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]], of which he was a founding member in 1563.\n\nThe painter [[Alessandro Allori]] was his favourite pupil, and Bronzino was living in the Allori family house at the time of his death in Florence in 1572 (Alessandro was also the father of [[Cristofano Allori]]).<ref name=\"NG\">Cecil Gould, ''The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools, National Gallery Catalogues'', (London 1975), {{ISBN|0-947645-22-5}}</ref> Bronzino spent the majority of his career in Florence.\n\n[[File:Bronzino - Eleonora di Toledo col figlio Giovanni - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Portrait of Eleanor of Toledo|Eleonora di Toledo col figlio Giovanni]]'', 1544\u201345, oil on wood, [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\n\n==Work==\n\n===Portraits===\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Portrait of a Young Man.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Young Man'', c. 1550\u201355, London, National Gallery]]\n\nBronzino first received Medici patronage in 1539, when he was one of the many artists chosen to execute the elaborate decorations for the wedding of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]] to [[Eleonora di Toledo]], daughter of the [[Viceroy of Naples]]. It was not long before he became, and remained for most of his career, the official court painter of the Duke and his court. His portrait figures\u2014often read as static, elegant, and stylish exemplars of unemotional haughtiness and assurance\u2014influenced the course of European court portraiture for a century. These well known paintings exist in many workshop versions and copies. In addition to images of the Florentine elite, Bronzino also painted idealized portraits of the [[poet]]s [[Dante]] (c. 1530, now in [[National Gallery of Art|Washington, DC]]) and [[Petrarch]].\n\nBronzino's best known works comprise the aforementioned series of the duke and duchess, [[portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici|Cosimo]] and [[portrait of Eleonora di Toledo|Eleonora]], and figures of their court such as Bartolomeo  Panciatichi and his wife [[portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi|Lucrezia]]. These paintings, especially those of the duchess, are known for their minute attention to the detail of her costume, which almost takes on a personality of its own in the image at right.  Here the Duchess is pictured with her second son Giovanni, who died of malaria in 1562, along with his mother; however it is the sumptuous fabric of the dress that takes up more space on the canvas than either of the sitters.  Indeed, the dress itself has been the object of some scholarly debate.  The elaborate gown has been rumored to be so beloved by the duchess that she was ultimately buried in it; when this myth was debunked, others suggested that perhaps the garment never existed at all and Bronzino invented the entire thing, perhaps working only from a fabric swatch.  In any case, this picture was reproduced over and over by Bronzino and his shop, becoming one of the most iconic images of the duchess.

''[[Crossing the Red Sea (Bronzino)|Crossing the Red Sea]]'' is typical of Bronzino's approach at this time, though it should not be claimed that Bronzino or the court was lacking in religious fervor on the basis of the preferred court fashion.  Indeed, the [[duchess]] Eleanora was a generous patron to the recently founded [[Jesuit]] order.<ref>Janet Cox-Rearick, ''Bronzino's Chapel of Eleonora in the Palazzo Vecchio'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993).</ref>\n\nBronzino's work tends to include sophisticated references to earlier painters, as in one of his last grand frescoes called ''The Martyrdom of St. Lawrence'' (San Lorenzo, 1569), in which almost every one of the extraordinarily contorted poses can be traced back to [[Raphael]] or to [[Michelangelo]], whom Bronzino idolized (cf. Brock).  Bronzino's skill with the [[nude]] was even more enigmatically deployed in the celebrated ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', which conveys strong feelings of [[eroticism]] under the pretext of a moralizing [[allegory]]. His other major works include the design of a series of [[tapestries]] on ''[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|The Story of Joseph]]'', for the Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nMany of Bronzino's works are still in Florence but other examples can be found in the [[National Gallery, London]], and elsewhere.\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino 055.jpg|thumbnail|''Lodovico Capponi'']]\n <!-- [[File:Angelo Bronzino

Wyatt attempts to run away, intending to lie about his age and join the war, but his father catches him. His brothers return home at the war's end, with James gravely wounded, and the family moves west. Wyatt sees a man killed during a gunfight, and vomits at the sight.\n\nYears later, Wyatt works out west as a wagon driver, also serving as a referee for fights, and finds himself at odds with a bully. Wyatt and the bully come to the point of fighting, with the bully intending to shoot him, but Wyatt disarms and defeats him, taking his gun.\n\nReturning home to [[Missouri]], Wyatt marries his childhood sweetheart, Urilla Sutherland. They move into their own house, and he begins working as a policeman. Months later, his pregnant wife dies from [[typhoid fever]]. After staying by her side through the illness, Wyatt becomes deeply depressed. Burning their home and possessions, he begins drinking and drifts from town to town, landing in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. He robs a man and steals his horse, but is captured. With Wyatt facing certain hanging, his father bails him out of jail, telling him to never return to Arkansas.\n\nWorking as a buffalo hunter, Wyatt befriends [[Bat Masterson]] and his brother [[Ed Masterson]]. Years pass, and Wyatt becomes a deputy marshal in [[Wichita, Kansas]], building a reputation as a good lawman. He is recruited to work as a deputy in [[Dodge City]], with a lower salary but earning extra money for every arrest. In Dodge City, Wyatt kills his first man, witnessed by actress [[Josephine Marcus|Josie Marcus]]. Wyatt becomes romantically involved with a prostitute, [[Mattie Blaylock]], and the Mastersons join him as deputies. Wyatt believes Ed is too passive, but the Dodge City council fires Wyatt for his [[excessive force]], appointing Ed to take his place. Wyatt begins working for the railroad, capturing outlaws.\n\nPursuing outlaw [[Dave Rudabaugh]], Wyatt is introduced to gunman and gambler [[Doc Holliday]] in [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], and the two become friends. Holliday assists Earp in locating Rudabaugh, whom he dislikes tremendously. Wyatt receives word that Ed has been killed, having shot and killed both his assailants before dying in the street. Wyatt returns to Dodge City to help bring law and order, before moving his family to [[Tombstone, Arizona]], despite the wives\u2019 and Mattie's protests. Wyatt immediately finds himself at odds with the \"Cowboy\" gang. He becomes romantically involved with Josie Marcus, angering her boyfriend [[Johnny Behan|Sheriff Behan]] and stressing his relationship with Mattie, and becomes the subject of rumor about town.\n\nWyatt and his brothers [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] and Virgil arrest several Cowboys, and Virgil takes over as marshal following the murder of [[Fred White (marshal)|Fred White]]. Tension builds between the brothers and the gang as Wyatt breaks up several altercations involving the Cowboys, particularly [[Ike Clanton]], and [[Doc Holliday]] swears his loyalty to Wyatt, whom he considers his only real friend. The [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] makes the brothers very unpopular in town. Virgil is ambushed and wounded, and Morgan is killed. In the [[Earp Vendetta Ride|Vendetta Ride]], Wyatt and his friends take revenge against the remaining Cowboys.\n\nMany years later, Wyatt and Josie mine for gold in [[Alaska]]. A young man on the same boat recognizes Wyatt, and recounts a story in which Wyatt had saved the boy's uncle, \"[[Michael O'Rourke (gambler)|Tommy Behind-The-Deuce]]\". Wyatt says to Josie, \"Some people say it didn't happen that way\", to which she responds, \"Never mind them, Wyatt. It happened that way.\"\n\nAn [[epilogue]] states that Doc Holliday died six years later in a hospital in [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]]. Members of the Clanton gang continued to die mysteriously for years after Morgan's murder. Josie and Wyatt's marriage lasted 47 years until Wyatt died at age 80 in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Wyatt Earp]]\n** [[Ian Bohen]] as teenage Wyatt\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Doc Holliday]]\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as [[Nicholas Porter Earp]] \n* [[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]] as [[James Earp]]\n* [[Linden Ashby]] as [[Morgan Earp]]\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Warren Earp]]\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as [[Michael O'Rourke (gambler)|Tommy 'Behind-The-Deuce' O'Rourke]]\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as [[Ike Clanton]]\n* [[Joanna Going]] as [[Josephine Earp|Josie Marcus]]\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as [[Johnny Behan]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Virgil Earp]]\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Allie Earp\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as [[Ed Masterson]]\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as [[Big Nose Kate]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as [[Bat Masterson]]\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Bessie Earp\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as [[Mattie Blaylock]]\n* [[James Gammon]] as Mr. Sutherland\n* [[Karen Grassle]] as Mrs. Sutherland\n* [[Rex Linn]] as [[Frank McLaury]]\n* Gabriel Folse as [[Billy Clanton]]\n* [[Mackenzie Astin]] as Francis O'Rourke\n* [[Randle Mell]] as [[John Clum]]\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as [[Tom McLaury]]\n* [[Annabeth Gish]] as Urilla Sutherland\n* [[Lewis Smith (actor)|Lewis Smith]] as [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]]\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Virginia Earp\n* [[Alison Elliott]] as Lou Earp\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Sally\n* [[Martin Kove]] as Ed Ross\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nCostner was originally involved with the film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', another film about Wyatt Earp, written by [[Kevin Jarre]] of ''[[Glory film|Glory]]'' fame.

Wyatt attempts to run away, intending to lie about his age and join the war, but his father catches him. His brothers return home at the war's end, with James gravely wounded, and the family moves west. Wyatt sees a man killed during a gunfight, and vomits at the sight.\n\nYears later, Wyatt works out west as a wagon driver, also serving as a referee for fights, and finds himself at odds with a bully. Wyatt and the bully come to the point of fighting, with the bully intending to shoot him, but Wyatt disarms and defeats him, taking his gun.\n\nReturning home to [[Missouri]], Wyatt marries his childhood sweetheart, Urilla Sutherland. They move into their own house, and he begins working as a policeman. Months later, his pregnant wife dies from [[typhoid fever]]. After staying by her side through the illness, Wyatt becomes deeply depressed. Burning their home and possessions, he begins drinking and drifts from town to town, landing in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. He robs a man and steals his horse, but is captured.
