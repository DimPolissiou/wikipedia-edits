{"title_page": "Inca army", "text_new": "{{Lead too short|date=January 2018}}\n{{Inca civilization}}\nThe '''Inca army''' was a multi-ethnic army<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 361. The Inca army would have been composed of men from [[Cuzco]] and [[Quito]] as well as coastal and forest dwellers etc.</ref> charged with defending the sovereignty of the [[Inca Empire]], and the [[Sapa Inca]], who was ruler.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 377. The Inca armies were received in Cuzco's Plaza de Armas.</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\nAs the Inca Empire grew, an army created by a loose confederation of peasant warriors was replaced by one of professional officers. These officers were chosen during the [[Warachikuy]] festival, during which candidates had to undergo various tests of physical skill: such as racing, marksmanship, simulated combat and to see if they could stay awake for a long period, with it being reported that some officers could remain awake for a whole week.<ref>Victor Angles Vargas, ''Historia del Cusco incaico'', page 265.</ref> \nBananas were used to make people slip!\nInca battalions contained permanent staff (generals and officers) and non-permanent personnel composed of drafted ''hatun runas'' (common men), who would be serving their military ''[[mit'a]]'' public service, comparable to mandatory military service or the draft. Once the ''mit'a'' was fulfilled, each ''hatun runa'' would return to their respective ''[[ayllu]]'' (community).\nBANANAS WERE USED TO MAKE PEOPLES SLIP!\nEach [[battalion]] was made up of a single ethnic group, the whole group being directed by a ''[[Curaca|kuraka]]'' (warlord) of the same ethnicity. In the event that a ''kuraka'' fell in battle, a replacement was appointed from within the same ethnic group. In order to prevent rebellions and to promote successful performance in battle, two battalions were formed per ethnic group, each one under the command of a general (and both under the command of the ''kuraka''). Promotion was given to the general who gave the greatest display of bravery on the battlefield, which led to competition between the two battalions.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 361.</ref> This concept of \"duality\" is widespread in the Andean world and represents the two Inca dynasties: [[Inca civilization|Hanan and Hurin]].<ref>Mar\u00eda Rostworowski, Historia del Tawantinsuyu page 145.</ref>\n\nFrom the time of the rule of Emperor [[Tupac Yupanqui]], a specialized elite group of soldiers was appointed for the safekeeping of the [[Sapa Inca]] (\"the one and only Inca\") during parades, travel or campaigns.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 361. A written source dating from 1582 states that Tupac Yupanqui had a bodyguard of professional soldiers.</ref> These bodyguards originated primarily in [[Cusco]], though soldiers from other ethnicities were also accepted in their ranks. This imperial guard, consisting entirely of men belonging to the nobility, reached a size of 10,000 warriors.\n\nAll members of the Inca Army were between 25 and 50 years old.<ref>[http://www.tudiscovery.com/guia_incas/inca_politica/inca_ejercito/index.shtml ''\"Discovery Channel-Incas\"''] Revised 3 January 2008.</ref> All of the empire's citizens had to perform either military or community service. One in every 50 men over 25-years-old (the legal age of responsibility in the Inca Empire) would be chosen for military service. For noblemen, this was an honour and a duty, for common men, it was a means of social promotion. In accordance with the duality concept, one of every 50 young women was selected to serve in the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun.\n\nCommoners were considered to have fulfilled their military service obligations after six or seven years. The professional officers, however, were permanent soldiers, paid by the state. This military caste enjoyed several privileges, with the state paying for their food, clothing and housing costs, as well as supplying gifts such as [[coca]], jewellery, and wives.\n\n''Runas'' (common men) from the coastal region \u2014in contrast to men from the highlands\u2014 were not compelled to serve in the army. This is probably explained by their poor adaptation to the harsh climate conditions of the highlands, where most wars took place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.peruchay.com/2007/02/servicio-militar-obligatorio-en-el.html\n|title=Peruchay: Servicio militar obligatorio en el ejercito Inca\n|accessdate=3 February 2011\n|language=spanish\n}}</ref>\n\nArmy units would march in the company of a large number of women, mostly relatives of the soldiers. Women would take care of cooking and repair the soldiers' clothes and, after battles, would attend the wounded and help bury the dead. Inca armies would not fight at night for religious reasons. A group of priests would also be attached to the army units, in order to pray, make sacrifices, and try to weaken the opposing force by casting spells before and during battle. Weapons and other equipment were transported by [[llama]]s.\n\nIn the early stages of the Incan Empire, the army was mainly formed of ethnic Inca troops. Later on, however, only the officers and imperial guards were Incas (the Incas were 40,000<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI4Jz7jdP3o INCA PACHACUTEC \u2013 Cap1 (Dinastias)]</ref> to 100,000<ref>[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/p/pachacuti.htm Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui]</ref> strong, and they ruled an empire of 10 to 15 million<ref>Noble David Cook. 1981. ''Demographic collapse, Indian Peru, 1520\u20131620''. New York: Cambridge University Press</ref>). The squads were organized according to the ethnicity of the soldiers (''auca runas''). The soldiers were armed and dressed according to their tribe with animal skins, fabric shields, feathers, jewels or body paints.\n\nOnce a battle was over, enemy leaders would only be executed if they refused to accept the sovereignty of the Incas. The majority of conquered nations were absorbed into the Empire. Conquered nations were forced to adopt [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] as their main language, worship Inca gods and adopt Inca social customs. Inca government officials would perform a careful study of the conquered zone to ensure the achievement of these objectives.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos/incas/incas.shtml\n|title=los incas - Monografias.com\n|accessdate=3 February 2011\n|author1=Joaquin Pibernat |author2=Juan Martin Hilbert |author3=Cristobal Cebral |author4=Kevin Richards |language=Spanish\n}}</ref>\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nBefore battle, the Inca army would usually parade in order to arouse awe in the opposing army. The soldiers would march with their banners and the commander would be carried in his litter carrying the symbol of his command. Should the opposing force still be willing to fight, the general in command (or the Inca himself) would review the troops while musical instruments were played. After this, the commanding officer would rally the troops for the attack. The Sapa Inca himself would rally the troops in larger campaigns; for smaller rebellions, barbarian invasions, or small campaigns, a general or a prince would be sent as his representative.\n\nThe Inca army's military effectiveness was based on two main elements: logistics and discipline. In order to facilitate the movement of their armies, the Inca built a vast road system. Staging areas were set along the roads so the troops and animals could rest and weapons could be obtained. Discipline was very rigid. Soldiers were not allowed to leave the battalion, even during the course of a march.<ref>[http://www.tudiscovery.com/guia_incas/inca_politica/inca_ejercito/index.shtml Tu discovery. Pol\u00edtica inca]</ref> Troops would maintain silence, only breaking it just before battle by yelling and singing in order to intimidate the opposing force.\n\nArmy squads were organized in a series of lines. The front lines were initially occupied by slingshot bearers and archers, who would go to the rearguard of the formation after the initial barrages. The lines behind them were occupied by storm-troopers with clubs and axes, these were followed by short-spear bearers, and closing the formation were long-spear bearers (up to 6 meters long).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/image/ejercitoinca.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727224452/http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/image/ejercitoinca.jpg |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring a battle on the open ground, the Inca army would usually be divided into three groups. The main group would launch a frontal attack against the opposing force, while the other two would flank the enemy and circle around behind them to attack from the rear.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFPXo8IxXCs&NR=1 INCA PACHACUTEC \u2013 Cap4 (Dinastias)]</ref> Before the hand-to-hand combat would start, the Inca army would use ranged weapons (slingshots, arrows and short spears) in order to break the enemy's lines.

The Inca army, by contrast, was so well disciplined that it very rarely broke formation and was able to effectively repel ambushes in the jungle, desert, mountain and swamp terrains.\n\nIn the event that the opposing force would take refuge in a fortress, mountain, or city, the Inca forces would cut communication and supply lines in order to isolate the enemy and prevent retreat or requests for reinforcements. If negotiations failed, the Inca forces would attempt to storm the fortress and/or starve the opposing force.\n\nOccupied cities and their inhabitants were usually well treated if they surrendered without resistance. If, however, the enemy did resist then they could suffer a number of punishments depending on the degree of resistance offered. If a city or tribe surrendered and then rebelled, the Inca could even authorize the complete annihilation of the city or ethnic group (as was the case with the Pastos and the Punae\u00f1os).\n\nIf retreat was necessary, the Inca army would usually march along roads in a disciplined manner, following the quickest route available. The army would only rest in fortresses with the objective of re-arming should a counterattack be made. Garrisons would be left in the fortresses that controlled the roads in order to delay a possible advance by the enemy.\n\nThe main advantage of the Inca Army over its enemies was its numeric superiority. While typical adversaries were warriors from a single tribe (or at most, an alliance of several tribes), the imperial troops were formed of men from all over the empire. Thanks to the large size of the empire, an army of hundreds of thousands of warriors could be mobilized. This wide variety of men would prove both an advantage (numerical superiority and specialized soldiers for different terrain) and a disadvantage (lack of cohesion between army battalions). Both [[Inca]] oral histories and Spanish written accounts estimate that the Incas could field armies of 100,000 at a time.<ref>{{cite book | first = Terence N. | last = D;Altroy | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | title = The Incas | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-631-17677-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/incasthepeopleso00tere/page/216 216] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/incasthepeopleso00tere/page/216 }}</ref>\n\nThe Incas usually sent scouts to watch their enemies; they would also send groups of nobles to negotiate peace treaties. On a number of occasions, the servants that these emissaries took were spies who tried to bribe enemy officers so that they would betray their kings by retreating during a crucial moment in a battle.\n\nThere was a reward system in place for distinguished services. Soldiers displaying bravery beyond expectations were rewarded with [[medal]]s, metal weapons, or other objects and uniforms.\n\nThe Incas also built forts (''pucar\u00e1'') where they stored arms, food and reserve soldiers. These fortresses also controlled the main communication routes and were constructed in easily defended locations such as in mountains and on the tops of hills or at the side of a river or road.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Inca army was divided in the following manner:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://images.google.cl/imgres?imgurl=http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/image/ejercitoinca.jpg&imgrefurl=http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/page/historia2.htm&usg=__uEhIDOwMnu6QW18yXBiaMznEb5Q=&h=359&w=300&sz=36&hl=es&start=11&um=1&tbnid=mTzHB_pxQJ_l1M:&tbnh=121&tbnw=101&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dejercito%2Binca%26hl%3Des%26sa%3DX%26um%3D1\n|title=Resultados de la B\u00fasqueda de im\u00e1genes de Google de rumimaki\n|accessdate=9 December 2010\n|author=auka wasi\n|language=Spanish\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://images.google.cl/imgres?imgurl=http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l115/chassepot/Inca20Warriors202.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.batallas.org/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D21030%26sid%3D7ed0fd4bc0e54b0a43992ce876c51063&usg=__VAmtjvhmgGFZ1dplSzya8G9RIPc=&h=800&w=576&sz=79&hl=es&start=5&um=1&tbnid=fzydyunPFW8fVM:&tbnh=143&tbnw=103&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dejercito%2Binca%26hl%3Des%26sa%3DX%26um%3D1\n|title=Resultados de la B\u00fasqueda de im\u00e1genes de Google de Inca Warriors\n|accessdate=9 December 2010\n|language=Spanish\n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ejercitodelecuador.mil.ec/images/pdf/Historia/hejer1.pdf Historia del Ej\u00e9rcito Ecuatoriano.

This was generally a nobleman from Cuzco who would have been a veteran of several campaigns. The head of the field army was the ''Apusquispay'', he would have been a noble chosen by the Inca and he would have shown himself to have been in good physical and mental condition at the Huarachico trials. In order to give orders, the generals used conche blowers, trumpeters or drummers to communicate with their lieutenants.\n\n== Equipment ==\nInca soldiers carried several types of simple weapons, according to the ethnic group to which they belonged. For example, Chanca soldiers preferred the use of clubs or [[macana]]s, while [[Antisuyu]] (Jungle highlands) troops more often leaned towards the use of [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]].\n[[File:Man's Tunic LACMA M.76.45.8 (1 of 3).jpg|thumb|left|An Incan standard military tunic made of black and white checks and a red triangle below the neck.]]\n\n=== Protection ===\n* Shields (Quechua: ''Hualcana''): Used by higher-ranking soldiers, built from [[wood]] covered in [[leather]].

These benefits could include gifts, investment in public works, recognition at their investiture, interchange of women to establish family ties, etc. Whether submission was due to fear of the Inca army or genuine friendship, the curaca became a beneficiary of the offered gifts, but he also became subject to Inca demands: his lands had to be handed over to the state, he had to supply labour and soldiers, etc. It was a conquest through reciprocity.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n=== Violent conquest ===\nViolent conquest would occur if a tribe was unwilling to accept the Sapa Inca as their emperor. This generally resulted in a bloody war. The conquered tribe would be subject to reprisals according to the length of the war. The defeated leader would be executed and, depending on the degree of their rebellion, the subjects would either be moved to a distant place or, in extreme cases, totally annihilated as a punishment to avoid future uprisings.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Local phase (13th century\u20131438) ===\n[[File:Tawantinsuyo.gif|200px|thumb|Expansion of the [[Inca Empire]].]]\nThis phase lasted from the beginning of the Inca period until the end of the rule of [[Pachacuti]] (or Pachac\u00fatec).

On occasions, the rulers also led the army into battle.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 51.

The [[Aymara people|Aymara]] or the powerful [[Chancas]] were greater threats and the Inca army had to confront them on a number of occasions.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 68.

The Inca armies were received in Cuzco's Plaza de Armas.</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\nAs the Inca Empire grew, an army created by a loose confederation of peasant warriors was replaced by one of professional officers. These officers were chosen during the [[Warachikuy]] festival, during which candidates had to undergo various tests of physical skill: such as racing, marksmanship, simulated combat and to see if they could stay awake for a long period, with it being reported that some officers could remain awake for a whole week.<ref>Victor Angles Vargas, ''Historia del Cusco incaico'', page 265.</ref> \n\nInca battalions contained permanent staff (generals and officers) and non-permanent personnel composed of drafted ''hatun runas'' (common men), who would be serving their military ''[[mit'a]]'' public service, comparable to mandatory military service or the draft. Once the ''mit'a'' was fulfilled, each ''hatun runa'' would return to their respective ''[[ayllu]]'' (community).\n\nEach [[battalion]] was made up of a single ethnic group, the whole group being directed by a ''[[Curaca|kuraka]]'' (warlord) of the same ethnicity. In the event that a ''kuraka'' fell in battle, a replacement was appointed from within the same ethnic group. In order to prevent rebellions and to promote successful performance in battle, two battalions were formed per ethnic group, each one under the command of a general (and both under the command of the ''kuraka''). Promotion was given to the general who gave the greatest display of bravery on the battlefield, which led to competition between the two battalions.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 361.</ref> This concept of \"duality\" is widespread in the Andean world and represents the two Inca dynasties: [[Inca civilization|Hanan and Hurin]].<ref>Mar\u00eda Rostworowski, Historia del Tawantinsuyu page 145.</ref>\n\nFrom the time of the rule of Emperor [[Tupac Yupanqui]], a specialized elite group of soldiers was appointed for the safekeeping of the [[Sapa Inca]] (\"the one and only Inca\") during parades, travel or campaigns.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 361. A written source dating from 1582 states that Tupac Yupanqui had a bodyguard of professional soldiers.</ref> These bodyguards originated primarily in [[Cusco]], though soldiers from other ethnicities were also accepted in their ranks. This imperial guard, consisting entirely of men belonging to the nobility, reached a size of 10,000 warriors.\n\nAll members of the Inca Army were between 25 and 50 years old.<ref>[http://www.tudiscovery.com/guia_incas/inca_politica/inca_ejercito/index.shtml ''\"Discovery Channel-Incas\"''] Revised 3 January 2008.</ref> All of the empire's citizens had to perform either military or community service. One in every 50 men over 25-years-old (the legal age of responsibility in the Inca Empire) would be chosen for military service. For noblemen, this was an honour and a duty, for common men, it was a means of social promotion. In accordance with the duality concept, one of every 50 young women was selected to serve in the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun.\n\nCommoners were considered to have fulfilled their military service obligations after six or seven years. The professional officers, however, were permanent soldiers, paid by the state. This military caste enjoyed several privileges, with the state paying for their food, clothing and housing costs, as well as supplying gifts such as [[coca]], jewellery, and wives.\n\n''Runas'' (common men) from the coastal region \u2014in contrast to men from the highlands\u2014 were not compelled to serve in the army. This is probably explained by their poor adaptation to the harsh climate conditions of the highlands, where most wars took place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.peruchay.com/2007/02/servicio-militar-obligatorio-en-el.html\n|title=Peruchay: Servicio militar obligatorio en el ejercito Inca\n|accessdate=3 February 2011\n|language=spanish\n}}</ref>\n\nArmy units would march in the company of a large number of women, mostly relatives of the soldiers. Women would take care of cooking and repair the soldiers' clothes and, after battles, would attend the wounded and help bury the dead. Inca armies would not fight at night for religious reasons. A group of priests would also be attached to the army units, in order to pray, make sacrifices, and try to weaken the opposing force by casting spells before and during battle. Weapons and other equipment were transported by [[llama]]s.\n\nIn the early stages of the Incan Empire, the army was mainly formed of ethnic Inca troops. Later on, however, only the officers and imperial guards were Incas (the Incas were 40,000<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI4Jz7jdP3o INCA PACHACUTEC \u2013 Cap1 (Dinastias)]</ref> to 100,000<ref>[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/p/pachacuti.htm Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui]</ref> strong, and they ruled an empire of 10 to 15 million<ref>Noble David Cook. 1981.

The soldiers were armed and dressed according to their tribe with animal skins, fabric shields, feathers, jewels or body paints.\n\nOnce a battle was over, enemy leaders would only be executed if they refused to accept the sovereignty of the Incas. The majority of conquered nations were absorbed into the Empire. Conquered nations were forced to adopt [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] as their main language, worship Inca gods and adopt Inca social customs. Inca government officials would perform a careful study of the conquered zone to ensure the achievement of these objectives.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.monografias.com/trabajos/incas/incas.shtml\n|title=los incas - Monografias.com\n|accessdate=3 February 2011\n|author1=Joaquin Pibernat |author2=Juan Martin Hilbert |author3=Cristobal Cebral |author4=Kevin Richards |language=Spanish\n}}</ref>\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nBefore battle, the Inca army would usually parade in order to arouse awe in the opposing army. The soldiers would march with their banners and the commander would be carried in his litter carrying the symbol of his command. Should the opposing force still be willing to fight, the general in command (or the Inca himself) would review the troops while musical instruments were played. After this, the commanding officer would rally the troops for the attack. The Sapa Inca himself would rally the troops in larger campaigns; for smaller rebellions, barbarian invasions, or small campaigns, a general or a prince would be sent as his representative.\n\nThe Inca army's military effectiveness was based on two main elements: logistics and discipline. In order to facilitate the movement of their armies, the Inca built a vast road system. Staging areas were set along the roads so the troops and animals could rest and weapons could be obtained. Discipline was very rigid. Soldiers were not allowed to leave the battalion, even during the course of a march.<ref>[http://www.tudiscovery.com/guia_incas/inca_politica/inca_ejercito/index.shtml Tu discovery. Pol\u00edtica inca]</ref> Troops would maintain silence, only breaking it just before battle by yelling and singing in order to intimidate the opposing force.\n\nArmy squads were organized in a series of lines. The front lines were initially occupied by slingshot bearers and archers, who would go to the rearguard of the formation after the initial barrages. The lines behind them were occupied by storm-troopers with clubs and axes, these were followed by short-spear bearers, and closing the formation were long-spear bearers (up to 6 meters long).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/image/ejercitoinca.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727224452/http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/image/ejercitoinca.jpg |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring a battle on the open ground, the Inca army would usually be divided into three groups. The main group would launch a frontal attack against the opposing force, while the other two would flank the enemy and circle around behind them to attack from the rear.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFPXo8IxXCs&NR=1 INCA PACHACUTEC \u2013 Cap4 (Dinastias)]</ref> Before the hand-to-hand combat would start, the Inca army would use ranged weapons (slingshots, arrows and short spears) in order to break the enemy's lines.

The Inca army, by contrast, was so well disciplined that it very rarely broke formation and was able to effectively repel ambushes in the jungle, desert, mountain and swamp terrains.\n\nIn the event that the opposing force would take refuge in a fortress, mountain, or city, the Inca forces would cut communication and supply lines in order to isolate the enemy and prevent retreat or requests for reinforcements. If negotiations failed, the Inca forces would attempt to storm the fortress and/or starve the opposing force.\n\nOccupied cities and their inhabitants were usually well treated if they surrendered without resistance. If, however, the enemy did resist then they could suffer a number of punishments depending on the degree of resistance offered. If a city or tribe surrendered and then rebelled, the Inca could even authorize the complete annihilation of the city or ethnic group (as was the case with the Pastos and the Punae\u00f1os).\n\nIf retreat was necessary, the Inca army would usually march along roads in a disciplined manner, following the quickest route available. The army would only rest in fortresses with the objective of re-arming should a counterattack be made. Garrisons would be left in the fortresses that controlled the roads in order to delay a possible advance by the enemy.\n\nThe main advantage of the Inca Army over its enemies was its numeric superiority. While typical adversaries were warriors from a single tribe (or at most, an alliance of several tribes), the imperial troops were formed of men from all over the empire. Thanks to the large size of the empire, an army of hundreds of thousands of warriors could be mobilized. This wide variety of men would prove both an advantage (numerical superiority and specialized soldiers for different terrain) and a disadvantage (lack of cohesion between army battalions). Both [[Inca]] oral histories and Spanish written accounts estimate that the Incas could field armies of 100,000 at a time.<ref>{{cite book | first = Terence N. | last = D;Altroy | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | title = The Incas | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-631-17677-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/incasthepeopleso00tere/page/216 216] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/incasthepeopleso00tere/page/216 }}</ref>\n\nThe Incas usually sent scouts to watch their enemies; they would also send groups of nobles to negotiate peace treaties. On a number of occasions, the servants that these emissaries took were spies who tried to bribe enemy officers so that they would betray their kings by retreating during a crucial moment in a battle.\n\nThere was a reward system in place for distinguished services. Soldiers displaying bravery beyond expectations were rewarded with [[medal]]s, metal weapons, or other objects and uniforms.\n\nThe Incas also built forts (''pucar\u00e1'') where they stored arms, food and reserve soldiers. These fortresses also controlled the main communication routes and were constructed in easily defended locations such as in mountains and on the tops of hills or at the side of a river or road.\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Inca army was divided in the following manner:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://images.google.cl/imgres?imgurl=http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/image/ejercitoinca.jpg&imgrefurl=http://aukawasi.rumimaki.org/page/historia2.htm&usg=__uEhIDOwMnu6QW18yXBiaMznEb5Q=&h=359&w=300&sz=36&hl=es&start=11&um=1&tbnid=mTzHB_pxQJ_l1M:&tbnh=121&tbnw=101&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dejercito%2Binca%26hl%3Des%26sa%3DX%26um%3D1\n|title=Resultados de la B\u00fasqueda de im\u00e1genes de Google de rumimaki\n|accessdate=9 December 2010\n|author=auka wasi\n|language=Spanish\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://images.google.cl/imgres?imgurl=http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l115/chassepot/Inca20Warriors202.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.batallas.org/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D21030%26sid%3D7ed0fd4bc0e54b0a43992ce876c51063&usg=__VAmtjvhmgGFZ1dplSzya8G9RIPc=&h=800&w=576&sz=79&hl=es&start=5&um=1&tbnid=fzydyunPFW8fVM:&tbnh=143&tbnw=103&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dejercito%2Binca%26hl%3Des%26sa%3DX%26um%3D1\n|title=Resultados de la B\u00fasqueda de im\u00e1genes de Google de Inca Warriors\n|accessdate=9 December 2010\n|language=Spanish\n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ejercitodelecuador.mil.ec/images/pdf/Historia/hejer1.pdf Historia del Ej\u00e9rcito Ecuatoriano.

This was generally a nobleman from Cuzco who would have been a veteran of several campaigns. The head of the field army was the ''Apusquispay'', he would have been a noble chosen by the Inca and he would have shown himself to have been in good physical and mental condition at the Huarachico trials. In order to give orders, the generals used conche blowers, trumpeters or drummers to communicate with their lieutenants.\n\n== Equipment ==\nInca soldiers carried several types of simple weapons, according to the ethnic group to which they belonged. For example, Chanca soldiers preferred the use of clubs or [[macana]]s, while [[Antisuyu]] (Jungle highlands) troops more often leaned towards the use of [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and [[arrow]].\n[[File:Man's Tunic LACMA M.76.45.8 (1 of 3).jpg|thumb|left|An Incan standard military tunic made of black and white checks and a red triangle below the neck.]]\n\n=== Protection ===\n* Shields (Quechua: ''Hualcana''): Used by higher-ranking soldiers, built from [[wood]] covered in [[leather]].

These benefits could include gifts, investment in public works, recognition at their investiture, interchange of women to establish family ties, etc. Whether submission was due to fear of the Inca army or genuine friendship, the curaca became a beneficiary of the offered gifts, but he also became subject to Inca demands: his lands had to be handed over to the state, he had to supply labour and soldiers, etc. It was a conquest through reciprocity.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n=== Violent conquest ===\nViolent conquest would occur if a tribe was unwilling to accept the Sapa Inca as their emperor. This generally resulted in a bloody war. The conquered tribe would be subject to reprisals according to the length of the war. The defeated leader would be executed and, depending on the degree of their rebellion, the subjects would either be moved to a distant place or, in extreme cases, totally annihilated as a punishment to avoid future uprisings.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Local phase (13th century\u20131438) ===\n[[File:Tawantinsuyo.gif|200px|thumb|Expansion of the [[Inca Empire]].]]\nThis phase lasted from the beginning of the Inca period until the end of the rule of [[Pachacuti]] (or Pachac\u00fatec). During this phase, the army was relatively small and weak. The only battles it fought were for reasons of defence or survival. On occasions, the rulers also led the army into battle.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 51. As occurred with [[Sinchi Roca]] or even Pachac\u00fatec himself.</ref>\nThere were frequent battles during this period against small tribes such as the Alcahuasis or the Canas. The [[Aymara people|Aymara]] or the powerful [[Chancas]] were greater threats and the Inca army had to confront them on a number of occasions.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 68. During this period the Aymara were the main threat to the Incas.

From this time on the Inca army would be a multiethnic army and it would be more sophisticated and numerous. \n\nThe conquered ethnic groups rapidly became a part of the Inca nation and contributed men to its armies. During this period the majority of the wars involved the conquest of new territories and it was at this time that the army was at its most powerful.<ref>Waldemar Espinoza, ''Los Incas'', page 102.

{"title_page": "Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (2000s)", "text_new": "{{Very long|rps=9|date=September 2009}}\nOne of the most highly profitable aspects of the '''Royal Canadian Mint'''\u2019s enterprise is in its '''Numismatic''' product line.<ref>Royal Canadian Mint 2006 Annual Report, page 4</ref> The euphoria surrounding the year 2000 led to the birth of the Millennium 25-cent coin program. The numismatic line included proof quality coins sold individually or as a complete set. This level of excess would come to signify the coming decade. The number of numismatic releases would increase on an annual basis starting in 2003. Numismatic three cents, five cents, and ten cents would be introduced, along with numismatic three dollars and eight dollars. Luxury coins would not be immune to the dramatic increases that ensued. Coins with face values of 250, 300 and 350 dollars would be introduced by 2006.\n\nA new trend for the RCM would emerge with the design of the numismatic three cent coin. The three cent coin was packaged in a coin and stamp set as part of a joint venture with Canada Post. This partnership would lead to another ten coin and stamp sets in the decade. An additional trend that emerged was the RCM's commitment to military and Olympic coins as well.\n\nFrom [[Vimy Ridge]] to [[D-Day]] to a new release of the Victory Nickel with a commemorative booklet, the 5-cent piece became very monumental in acknowledging the contributions of Canada's military in the 20th Century. With the advent of the Lucky Loonie, the good luck charm that brought Olympic gold to Canada's hockey teams in 2002, the RCM paid tribute to that accomplishment with its Going for the Gold set in 2002 featuring a double-dated Loon coin packaged with MacLean's magazine and Olympic stamps. This would be followed by the Sterling Silver Lucky Loonie coins in 2004 and 2006.\n\nThe decade would also be marked by very dramatic price increases. Items that could be classified as \u201cstaples\u201d in the numismatic offering, such as the Silver Dollar (Proof and Brilliant Uncirculated), the Hundred Dollar Gold, and the Two Hundred Gold, had not experienced significant price increases for several years.\n\nThe Silver Dollar from 2000 was priced at $29.95 (Proof) and $19.95 (BU){{clarify|date=April 2013}} but in 2006, these two items were now priced at $39.95 and $31.95. At the beginning of the 1990s, the silver dollar was priced at $22.95 for the proof version, and $16.75 for the brilliant version.\n\nMore dramatic was the pricing of the One Hundred and Two Hundred Dollar gold. The beginning of the millennium saw the One Hundred Dollar Gold at $259.95 but its price increased to $359.95 by 2006. In 1990, the price of such a coin would have been $245.00. Due to the increase in the value of gold, the two hundred dollar gold experienced an even larger spike in the pricing. Starting in 2000 at $414.95, the price would rise to $564.95. In 1990, the price was only $395.00.\n\nDuring the decade, there were various technological achievements. The first RCM gold coin to be directly laser etched was the $100 Gold Leduc Oil Fields coin from 2002.<ref>The CN Journal, The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Markham, Ontario, Vol. 53, No. 1, January\u2013February 2008, p.17</ref> The technique would be later used for the 2003 $100 Gold Marquis Wheat coin and the 2004 $20 Iceberg coin. In 2001, the RCM achieved innovation with the 2001 Marconi $5 silver coin. It was the first RCM coin to utilize with a direct lasered finish.<ref>The CN Journal:The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Volume 53, No. 1, January/February 2008, p.18</ref> One of the technological breakthroughs for the RCM involved the 2006 Canadian Achievement Series silver coin featuring Colonel Chris Hadfield. It was the first Canadian coin to be completely sculpted using computer software.<ref>The CN Journal:The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Volume 53, No. 1, January/February 2008, p.19</ref>\n\nThe Northern Lights $20 Silver Coin was the first RCM hologram coin to feature a hologram without a raised border and, therefore, no delineation.<ref>The CN Journal, The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Markham, Ontario, Vol. 53, No. 1, January\u2013February 2008, p.18</ref> The hologram merges with the engraved relief of the mountains. In 2006, the $30 Canadarm coin was the first Canadian coin to be completely sculpted using computer software.<ref>The CN Journal, The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Markham, Ontario, Vol. 53, No. 1, January\u2013February 2008, p.19</ref> Technically, it was a complex design to render, due to the depiction of the closed glass visor and the complicated features of the Canadarm.\n\n==Commemorative Silver Dollar Series==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Theme\n!Artist\n!Mintage (Proof)\n!Issue Price (Proof)\n!Mintage (BU){{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n!Issue Price (BU){{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n|-\n|2000\n|Voyage of Discovery\n|D.F.

The problem was that the Royal Mint was designing the effigy of King Edward VIII and now a new effigy would need to be created. The 1, 10 and 25 cent pieces in 1937 would be struck from dies with a 1936 date on the reverse. To distinguish that these coins were issued in 1937, a Dot Mint Mark was placed on the 1936 dies, and could be found beneath the year. These coins fulfilled demand for coins until new coinage tools with the effigy of King George VI were ready. While the 10 and 25 cent coins are more common, the 1 cent coins are rare, with about a half-dozen known to exist.\n*06SFS\n:Used to describe the rare 2006 $50 Four Seasons 5 ounce silver coin.  Only 2000 were minted.\n*H\n:Used to identify coins that were struck for Canada by the [[Birmingham Mint]], also known as the Heaton Mint, until 1907.\n*Innukshuk\n:All circulation coins for the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics]] have the Innukshuk Mint Mark on the obverse of the coin.\n*International Polar Year\n:The obverse of the 2007 [[International Polar Year]] $20 Numismatic Coin has the logo for the International Polar Year on the obverse of the coin.\n*Man Becomes Mountain\n**(Symbol of Paralympics)\n:All circulation coins for the [[2010 Vancouver Paralympics]] have the Paralympic Games logo on the obverse of the coin.\n*Maple Leaf\n:All coins with a Maple Leaf Mint Mark were struck in 1948 due to an emergency with coin toolage. The granting of India\u2019s independence resulted in the removal of IND:IMP (meaning Emperor of India) from King George VI\u2019s effigy. Due to the demand for circulation coins in 1948, coins for 1948 could not be struck until the new tools were received. The new tools would have the IND:IMP removed from them. In the meanwhile, coins were produced in 1948 with a year of 1947 on them. A small Maple Leaf Mint Mark was struck beside 1947 on the reverse of all coins to signify the year of production.\n*P\n:From 2001 to 2006, most one cent, five cents, ten cents, twenty-five cents, and fifty cents issued for circulation were struck with a P Mint Mark to represent the Royal Canadian Mint\u2019s plating process.\n*RCM Logo\n:At the CNA Convention in July 2006, the RCM unveiled its new Mint Mark to be used on all circulation and numismatic coinage. The agenda behind the implementation of this new Mint Mark was to help increase the RCM\u2019s image as a brand. The aim of the logo is to educate coin users and coin collectors, respectively, that the RCM is minting Canada\u2019s coins. The first Circulation Coin to have this new Mint Mark is the 10th Anniversary Two-Dollar coin. The first Numismatic Coin to have this new Mint Mark is the Snowbirds Coin and Stamp Set.<ref>Coin World, Vol. 47, Issue 2417, Page 74, August 7, 2006</ref>\n*T/\u00c9\n:In an effort to push the standard of quality higher, the RCM started to experiment with a gold bullion coin that would have a purity of 99.999%. The result was a Gold Maple Leaf Test Bullion coin with the Mint Mark of T/\u00c9 (to signify Test/\u00c9preuve).

The numismatic line included proof quality coins sold individually or as a complete set. This level of excess would come to signify the coming decade. The number of numismatic releases would increase on an annual basis starting in 2003. Numismatic three cents, five cents, and ten cents would be introduced, along with numismatic three dollars and eight dollars. Luxury coins would not be immune to the dramatic increases that ensued. Coins with face values of 250, 300 and 350 dollars would be introduced by 2006.\n\nA new trend for the RCM would emerge with the design of the numismatic three cent coin. The three cent coin was packaged in a coin and stamp set as part of a joint venture with Canada Post. This partnership would lead to another ten coin and stamp sets in the decade. An additional trend that emerged was the RCM's commitment to military and Olympic coins as well.\n\nFrom [[Vimy Ridge]] to [[D-Day]] to a new release of the Victory Nickel with a commemorative booklet, the 5-cent piece became very monumental in acknowledging the contributions of Canada's military in the 20th Century. With the advent of the Lucky Loonie, the good luck charm that brought Olympic gold to Canada's hockey teams in 2002, the RCM paid tribute to that accomplishment with its Going for the Gold set in 2002 featuring a double-dated Loon coin packaged with MacLean's magazine and Olympic stamps. This would be followed by the Sterling Silver Lucky Loonie coins in 2004 and 2006.\n\nThe decade would also be marked by very dramatic price increases. Items that could be classified as \u201cstaples\u201d in the numismatic offering, such as the Silver Dollar (Proof and Brilliant Uncirculated), the Hundred Dollar Gold, and the Two Hundred Gold, had not experienced significant price increases for several years.\n\nThe Silver Dollar from 2000 was priced at $29.95 (Proof) and $19.95 (BU){{clarify|date=April 2013}} but in 2006, these two items were now priced at $39.95 and $31.95. At the beginning of the 1990s, the silver dollar was priced at $22.95 for the proof version, and $16.75 for the brilliant version.\n\nMore dramatic was the pricing of the One Hundred and Two Hundred Dollar gold. The beginning of the millennium saw the One Hundred Dollar Gold at $259.95 but its price increased to $359.95 by 2006. In 1990, the price of such a coin would have been $245.00. Due to the increase in the value of gold, the two hundred dollar gold experienced an even larger spike in the pricing. Starting in 2000 at $414.95, the price would rise to $564.95. In 1990, the price was only $395.00.\n\nDuring the decade, there were various technological achievements. The first RCM gold coin to be directly laser etched was the $100 Gold Leduc Oil Fields coin from 2002.<ref>The CN Journal, The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Markham, Ontario, Vol. 53, No. 1, January\u2013February 2008, p.17</ref> The technique would be later used for the 2003 $100 Gold Marquis Wheat coin and the 2004 $20 Iceberg coin. In 2001, the RCM achieved innovation with the 2001 Marconi $5 silver coin. It was the first RCM coin to utilize with a direct lasered finish.<ref>The CN Journal:The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Volume 53, No. 1, January/February 2008, p.18</ref> One of the technological breakthroughs for the RCM involved the 2006 Canadian Achievement Series silver coin featuring Colonel Chris Hadfield. It was the first Canadian coin to be completely sculpted using computer software.<ref>The CN Journal:The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Volume 53, No. 1, January/February 2008, p.19</ref>\n\nThe Northern Lights $20 Silver Coin was the first RCM hologram coin to feature a hologram without a raised border and, therefore, no delineation.<ref>The CN Journal, The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Markham, Ontario, Vol. 53, No. 1, January\u2013February 2008, p.18</ref> The hologram merges with the engraved relief of the mountains. In 2006, the $30 Canadarm coin was the first Canadian coin to be completely sculpted using computer software.<ref>The CN Journal, The Official Publication of the Canadian Numismatic Association, Markham, Ontario, Vol. 53, No. 1, January\u2013February 2008, p.19</ref> Technically, it was a complex design to render, due to the depiction of the closed glass visor and the complicated features of the Canadarm.\n\n==Commemorative Silver Dollar Series==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Theme\n!Artist\n!Mintage (Proof)\n!Issue Price (Proof)\n!Mintage (BU){{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n!Issue Price (BU){{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n|-\n|2000\n|Voyage of Discovery\n|D.F.

The coins are featured on memorial plaques dedicated to four legends: Howie Morenz, Maurice Richard, Jean Beliveau, and Guy Lafleur. The obverse is the Susannah Blunt effigy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Each plaque also has two circulation five cent coins marking the start and end of each player's career. The coins were gold plated versions of the nickel aureate dollar used for circulating $1 coins.\n\nA special edition proof silver dollar was also issued with two different types of packaging.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Theme\n!Artist\n!Mintage\n!Issue Price (with acrylic stand)\n!Issue Price (with standard packaging)\n|-\n|2009\n|Montreal Canadiens centennial\n|Royal Canadian Mint engravers\n|15,000\n|$74.95\n|$69.95\n|-\n|}\n\n==Numismatic One, Three and Five Cents==\n'''One Cent'''\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Theme\n!Artist\n!Mintage\n!Issue Price\n|-\n|2004\n|2003 Annual Report Collectible\n|G.E.

The problem was that the Royal Mint was designing the effigy of King Edward VIII and now a new effigy would need to be created. The 1, 10 and 25 cent pieces in 1937 would be struck from dies with a 1936 date on the reverse. To distinguish that these coins were issued in 1937, a Dot Mint Mark was placed on the 1936 dies, and could be found beneath the year. These coins fulfilled demand for coins until new coinage tools with the effigy of King George VI were ready. While the 10 and 25 cent coins are more common, the 1 cent coins are rare, with about a half-dozen known to exist.\n*06SFS\n:Used to describe the rare 2006 $50 Four Seasons 5 ounce silver coin.  Only 2000 were minted.\n*H\n:Used to identify coins that were struck for Canada by the [[Birmingham Mint]], also known as the Heaton Mint, until 1907.\n*Innukshuk\n:All circulation coins for the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics]] have the Innukshuk Mint Mark on the obverse of the coin.\n*International Polar Year\n:The obverse of the 2007 [[International Polar Year]] $20 Numismatic Coin has the logo for the International Polar Year on the obverse of the coin.\n*Man Becomes Mountain\n**(Symbol of Paralympics)\n:All circulation coins for the [[2010 Vancouver Paralympics]] have the Paralympic Games logo on the obverse of the coin.\n*Maple Leaf\n:All coins with a Maple Leaf Mint Mark were struck in 1948 due to an emergency with coin toolage. The granting of India\u2019s independence resulted in the removal of IND:IMP (meaning Emperor of India) from King George VI\u2019s effigy. Due to the demand for circulation coins in 1948, coins for 1948 could not be struck until the new tools were received. The new tools would have the IND:IMP removed from them. In the meanwhile, coins were produced in 1948 with a year of 1947 on them. A small Maple Leaf Mint Mark was struck beside 1947 on the reverse of all coins to signify the year of production.\n*P\n:From 2001 to 2006, most one cent, five cents, ten cents, twenty-five cents, and fifty cents issued for circulation were struck with a P Mint Mark to represent the Royal Canadian Mint\u2019s plating process.\n*RCM Logo\n:At the CNA Convention in July 2006, the RCM unveiled its new Mint Mark to be used on all circulation and numismatic coinage. The agenda behind the implementation of this new Mint Mark was to help increase the RCM\u2019s image as a brand. The aim of the logo is to educate coin users and coin collectors, respectively, that the RCM is minting Canada\u2019s coins. The first Circulation Coin to have this new Mint Mark is the 10th Anniversary Two-Dollar coin. The first Numismatic Coin to have this new Mint Mark is the Snowbirds Coin and Stamp Set.<ref>Coin World, Vol. 47, Issue 2417, Page 74, August 7, 2006</ref>\n*T/\u00c9\n:In an effort to push the standard of quality higher, the RCM started to experiment with a gold bullion coin that would have a purity of 99.999%. The result was a Gold Maple Leaf Test Bullion coin with the Mint Mark of T/\u00c9 (to signify Test/\u00c9preuve). The date on the obverse of the coin was 2007 and it had a mintage of 500.\n*Teddy bear\n:When the RCM released its Baby Lullabies and CD Set, a sterling silver one dollar coin was included in the set. The one dollar coin included a mint mark of a teddy bear.\n*W\n:Used occasionally on specimen sets produced in Winnipeg, starting in 1998.\n*W/P\n:Used on the Special Edition Uncirculated Set of 2003. The W mint mark stated that the coin was produced in Winnipeg and the P states that the coins are plated.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (20th century)]]\n*[[Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (2010s)]]\n*[[Canadian Silver Maple Leaf]]\n*[[Royal Canadian Mint Olympic Coins]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins, 60th Edition, 2006, W.K.
