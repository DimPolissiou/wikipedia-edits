The first four rounds of the competition were held at the home ground of the higher seed, while the College Cup (semifinals and [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|final]]) were held at [[WakeMed Soccer Park]] in [[Cary, North Carolina]]. The [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|championship match]] took place December 15, 2019.\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{main|2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season}}\n\nAs in previous editions of the NCAA Division I Tournament, the tournament features 48 participants out of a possible field of 203 teams. Of the 48 berths, 24 are allocated to the 21 conference tournament champions and to the regular season winners of the Ivy League, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference, which do not have tournaments. The remaining 24 berths are supposed to be determined through an at-large process based upon the [[Ratings Percentage Index]] (RPI) of teams that did not automatically qualify.\n\nThe NCAA Selection Committee also names the top sixteen seeds for the tournament, with those teams receiving an automatic bye into the second round of the tournament. The remaining 32 teams play in a single-elimination match in the first round of the tournament for the right to play a seeded team in the second round.\n\n=== Qualified teams ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

Division I Men's Soccer Tournament''' was the 61st edition of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], a postseason tournament to determine the national champion of [[NCAA Division I]] men's [[college soccer]]. The first four rounds of the competition were held at the home ground of the higher seed, while the College Cup (semifinals and [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|final]]) were held at [[WakeMed Soccer Park]] in [[Cary, North Carolina]]. The [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|championship match]] took place December 15, 2019.\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{main|2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season}}\n\nAs in previous editions of the NCAA Division I Tournament, the tournament features 48 participants out of a possible field of 203 teams. Of the 48 berths, 24 are allocated to the 21 conference tournament champions and to the regular season winners of the Ivy League, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference, which do not have tournaments. The remaining 24 berths are supposed to be determined through an at-large process based upon the [[Ratings Percentage Index]] (RPI) of teams that did not automatically qualify.\n\nThe NCAA Selection Committee also names the top sixteen seeds for the tournament, with those teams receiving an automatic bye into the second round of the tournament. The remaining 32 teams play in a single-elimination match in the first round of the tournament for the right to play a seeded team in the second round.\n\n=== Qualified teams ===\n{| class=\"wikitable
