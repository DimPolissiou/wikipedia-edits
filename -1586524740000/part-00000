In 1995, the station split to become two separate stations.\n\n== History ==\nUntil summer 1981, the only local radio output available to listeners in the North East of Scotland was a regional opt-out from the [[BBC]] at Beechgrove, which broadcast specialist music programmes for a couple of hours a week along with some opt-out regional news coverage. When a commercial radio franchise for Aberdeen, Peterhead and the surrounding areas was advertised by the then-regulator, the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]], a group of local businessmen applied under the consortium of ''North of Scotland Radio Ltd'' and won the franchise. \n\nAfter a change of name, ''Northsound Radio'' commenced broadcasting at 6{{nbsp}}am on 27 July 1981 from its original studios in an old schoolhouse on Kings Gate, near Anderson Drive in the city. Originally, the station was broadcast from 6{{nbsp}}am to 8{{nbsp}}pm each day on 1035 kHz (290 metres) and 96.9 FM (VHF).\n\nFor a two-year period from 1994, the station was the main sponsor of [[Aberdeen Football Club]], with the logo appearing on the players' shirts.<ref>[https://www.afc.co.uk/2017/06/26/the-history-of-the-blue-kit/ The history of the blue kit], [[Aberdeen Football Club]], 27 June 2017 </ref>\n\nIn 1995, Northsound split its services to become ''[[Northsound 1]]'' and ''[[Northsound 2]]''. Northsound 1 broadcasts on 96.9FM and plays popular music from the 1990s to today whilst ''[[Northsound 2]]'' follows a 'classic gold' style, with music from the 1950s to today alongside some specialist programming. Both stations now also broadcast on DAB ([[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] &ndash; i.e. Digital Radio).\n\nOn Tuesday 3 April 2018, Northsound 2 ceased broadcasting on 1035 AM and became a digital-only station on DAB and online. It is the first commercial radio station in Scotland - and the first of Bauer's local stations - to cease analogue broadcasting in favour of a digital switchover.<ref>[https://radiotoday.co.uk/2018/03/northsound-2-to-switch-off-am-radio-service/ Northsound 2 to switch off AM radio service], Radio Today, 8 March 2018</ref>\n\n== Free concerts ==\nFrom 1997 until 2007, Northsound held free music concerts in [[Aberdeen]] almost bi-annually. Northsound delivered its first major outdoor event when the Tall Ships arrived in Aberdeen, which called ''Free at the Quay''. Following its success, ''Free 2000'' was staged at the Queen\u2019s Links at Aberdeen Beach followed by ''Free at the Dee'' at Duthie Park. \n\nDue to the numbers attending, Northsound decided to move the event to [[Hazlehead Park]] and the event was renamed to simply ''Free 2007''. More than 30,000 people attended ''Free 2007'' which saw Beverley Knight, McFly, Shayne Ward, Booty Luv, MacDonald Brothers, Ali Love, Unklejam and others perform free.\n\nNorthsound are also sponsors and organisers of Aberdeen's free Hogmanay street party, where in previous years stars such as [[Sandi Thom]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Amy MacDonald (singer)|Amy MacDonald]] have played to large crowds.\n\n==Notable DJs ==\n<!-- Only add those with Wikipedia articles, otherwise they are non-notable and will be removed -->\n*[[Nicky Campbell]] - now a [[BBC]] journalist and television presenter.{{r|BBC}}{{r|Guardian}}\n*[[Robin Galloway]] - later became a continuity announcer and newsreader for [[Grampian Television]].

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg had the [[List of most-viewed YouTube channels|most-viewed channel on YouTube]]. {{as of|2020|4|6}}, his channel has received over 104 million subscribers and 25 billion views, ranking as the second-most-subscribed and thirteenth-most-viewed channel on the platform, and the most-subscribed and most-viewed channel operated by an individual.\n\nKjellberg's popularity on YouTube has caused him to become one of the most noted online personalities. Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.
