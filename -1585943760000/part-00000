The current record price is approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]400 million paid for [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|''Salvator Mundi'']] in November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title='Lost' Leonardo da Vinci to go on display, says National Gallery|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8632230/Lost-Leonardo-da-Vinci-to-go-on-display-says-National-Gallery.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=12 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=National Gallery Exhibition Catalogue|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/media/15705/exhibition-guide_leonardo-da-vinci.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe most famous paintings, especially [[old master]] works done before 1803, are generally owned or held at [[museum]]s, for viewing by patrons. Since the museums rarely sell them they are considered priceless. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' as having the highest ever [[insurance]] value for a painting. On permanent display at the [[Louvre]] in Paris, the ''Mona Lisa'' was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962. Taking [[inflation]] into account, the 1962 value would be around US${{Inflation|US|100|1962|r=-1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}}\n\nThe earliest sale on the list below (''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]]) is from March 1987; with a price of \u00a324.75 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|24.75|1987|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} currency). This sale tripled the previous record, and introduced a new era in top art sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was \u00a38.1 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|US|8.1|1985|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} currency) paid by the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] for [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' at [[Christie's]] in London on April 18, 1985.<ref>William Wilson, [https://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/entertainment/ca-15137_1_mantegna-paintings Getty Pays $10.5 Million For Painting], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 19, 1985</ref> In [[constant dollars]], the highest price paid before 1987 was by the [[National Gallery of Art]] when in February 1967 they acquired [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' for around $5 million (${{Inflation|US|5|1967}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) from the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]]. The sale of Van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'' was the first time a \"modern\" (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder, as opposed to the [[old master painting]]s which previously had dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875 paintings among the listed top 89, and none created between 1635 and 1874.\n\nAn exceptional case is graffiti artist [[David Choe]], who accepted payment in [[share (finance)|shares]] for painting graffiti art in the headquarters of a fledgling [[Facebook]].

The current record price is approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]400 million paid for [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|''Salvator Mundi'']] in November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title='Lost' Leonardo da Vinci to go on display, says National Gallery|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8632230/Lost-Leonardo-da-Vinci-to-go-on-display-says-National-Gallery.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=12 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=National Gallery Exhibition Catalogue|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/media/15705/exhibition-guide_leonardo-da-vinci.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe most famous paintings, especially [[old master]] works done before 1803, are generally owned or held at [[museum]]s, for viewing by patrons. Since the museums rarely sell them they are considered priceless. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' as having the highest ever [[insurance]] value for a painting. On permanent display at the [[Louvre]] in Paris, the ''Mona Lisa'' was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962. Taking [[inflation]] into account, the 1962 value would be around US${{Inflation|US|100|1962|r=-1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}}\n\nThe earliest sale on the list below (''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]]) is from March 1987; with a price of \u00a324.75 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|24.75|1987|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} currency). This sale tripled the previous record, and introduced a new era in top art sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was \u00a38.1 million (\u00a3{{Inflation|US|8.1|1985|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} currency) paid by the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] for [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' at [[Christie's]] in London on April 18, 1985.<ref>William Wilson, [https://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/entertainment/ca-15137_1_mantegna-paintings Getty Pays $10.5 Million For Painting], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 19, 1985</ref> In [[constant dollars]], the highest price paid before 1987 was by the [[National Gallery of Art]] when in February 1967 they acquired [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' for around $5 million (${{Inflation|US|5|1967}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) from the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]]. The sale of Van Gogh's ''Sunflowers'' was the first time a \"modern\" (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder, as opposed to the [[old master painting]]s which previously had dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875 paintings among the listed top 89, and none created between 1635 and 1874.\n\nAn exceptional case is graffiti artist [[David Choe]], who accepted payment in [[share (finance)|shares]] for painting graffiti art in the headquarters of a fledgling [[Facebook]]. His shares were of limited value when he was given them, but by the time of Facebook's [[IPO]] they were valued at around $200m.<ref name=\"NYT Facebook\">Nick Bilton, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/technology/for-founders-to-decorators-facebook-riches.html?_r=2 For Founders to Decorators, Facebook Riches],\" ''The New York Times'', 1/1/12.</ref>\n\nThe list is incomplete with respect to sales between private parties, as these are not always reported and, even if they are, details like the purchase price may remain secret.

It remains an agricultural town producing rice, corn and copra. Residents of a few coastal barangays are engaged in small-scale fishing and aquaculture. Its cottage industries are the manufacture of ''tuba'' (coconut [[palm wine]]) and ''[[Roscas (Filipino cuisine)|roscas]]'' (sweet pastries made of flour, sugar, eggs and [[shortening]]).

The grantee of an encomienda, known as encomiendero, was given the right to rule the encomienda in accordance with the Spanish laws and to extract tributes from the natives, part of which went to the Spanish Crown.\n\nMiguel Lopez de Legaspi, the first governor of the Islas Pilipinas, started the practice of designating large landed estates as encomiendas. Only ten months after Cebu and Manila became encomiendas, Barugo was also designated as one on November 3, 1571. Rodrigo de Vargas was the first encomiendero for Barugo.\n\nThe education of the natives in Leyte started with the arrival of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] on July 16, 1595. The mission schools in the beginning concentrated on the basics of Christianity. Barugo initially was only a \"''visita''\" of [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], meaning that it was under the administrative and spiritual supervision of the curate of Carigara, and was under the care of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, who eventually became its first [[parish priest]] after Barugo was declared as an independent parish. It was Fr. Sanchez who established the first church in Barugo.\n\nThe Jesuits stayed in Leyte from 1595 to 1767. During that time they expanded their influence starting from Carigara and Barugo, in the hinterlands of Ogmuc (Ormoc), Dulac (Dulag), Palo, Alangalang, Malibago (?) and the entire island of Cibabaw (Samar). When [[Charles III of Spain]] ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits from all Spanish dominions in 1767, the Jesuit mission on Leyte was handed over to the [[Augustinians]]. And later in 1843, the same missions were taken over by the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Friars]]. Fray Timoteo Calderon was the first Franciscan curate assigned to Barugo. At that time in 1843, Barugo already had 1,744 taxpayers and 8,381 residents. The towns of Alangalang, Jaro, Babatngon, Malibago (?) and [[San Miguel, Leyte|San Miguel]] were once only \"visitas\" of Barugo.\n\nIn Barugo there is a legend which was being taught to elementary pupils during the 1950s and 1960s regarding how the town got its name. The legend goes like this: \"Once upon a time there was a man named Cassadok. One day while he was resting by the river bank under the shade of a giant tree, a Spaniard came along and asked him the name of the place. Cassadok did not understand Spanish and thinking the Spaniard was asking the name of the big shady tree, answered \"Balugo.\" From that time on, the place came to be known as \"Balugo.\" When the Americans came, they changed the letter \"L\" to \"R\" and thus to this day the town is called Barugo.\" This story has no basis in fact and is simply a legend. For the early Spanish historians and chroniclers have always referred to the town by the name it carries today, Barugo.\n\nToday Barugo nestles along the coast of Carigara Bay. But the original settlement of Barugo was way upstream by the banks of the Himanglos River, which during the time of the conquistadores was called Barugo River.\n\nIt is highly probable that the first Barugo settlement was in the place which is now known as Nasunogan, meaning a place burned down. This assumption is born by the fact that the old Spanish road leading to the towns of Tunga and Jaro starts at this place and the ruins of an old Spanish stone church is found there. This assumption is also corroborated, firstly, by the writings of Fr. Chirino wherein he described their travels by foot to Barugo and of a settlement by \"la orilla,\" meaning by the bank of a river and by the mouth of the river. Secondly, the story of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, regarding their attempt to reach a seriously sick man, tells of their travel from the town of Barugo by \"a small boat in which we sailed to seek our sick man, who was living in horon, far from the town and near the coast.\"\n\nFrom Nasunogan, after the old settlement was burned, the people moved to another place which is now called Binongto-an, meaning a place abandoned as a town, now a sitio of Barangay Pikas. The settlers did not stay there long and moved eventually to the present site of the town. This conclusion stems from the fact that lasting structures can be found in Binongto-an.\n\n''(Excerpts from the research Barugo - Its Fabled History, conducted by a prominent Barugon-on, then Joel V.

It remains an agricultural town producing rice, corn and copra. Residents of a few coastal barangays are engaged in small-scale fishing and aquaculture. Its cottage industries are the manufacture of ''tuba'' (coconut [[palm wine]]) and ''[[Roscas (Filipino cuisine)|roscas]]'' (sweet pastries made of flour, sugar, eggs and [[shortening]]).

The grantee of an encomienda, known as encomiendero, was given the right to rule the encomienda in accordance with the Spanish laws and to extract tributes from the natives, part of which went to the Spanish Crown.\n\nMiguel Lopez de Legaspi, the first governor of the Islas Pilipinas, started the practice of designating large landed estates as encomiendas. Only ten months after Cebu and Manila became encomiendas, Barugo was also designated as one on November 3, 1571. Rodrigo de Vargas was the first encomiendero for Barugo.\n\nThe education of the natives in Leyte started with the arrival of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] on July 16, 1595. The mission schools in the beginning concentrated on the basics of Christianity. Barugo initially was only a \"''visita''\" of [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], meaning that it was under the administrative and spiritual supervision of the curate of Carigara, and was under the care of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, who eventually became its first [[parish priest]] after Barugo was declared as an independent parish. It was Fr. Sanchez who established the first church in Barugo.\n\nThe Jesuits stayed in Leyte from 1595 to 1767. During that time they expanded their influence starting from Carigara and Barugo, in the hinterlands of Ogmuc (Ormoc), Dulac (Dulag), Palo, Alangalang, Malibago (?) and the entire island of Cibabaw (Samar). When [[Charles III of Spain]] ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits from all Spanish dominions in 1767, the Jesuit mission on Leyte was handed over to the [[Augustinians]]. And later in 1843, the same missions were taken over by the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Friars]]. Fray Timoteo Calderon was the first Franciscan curate assigned to Barugo. At that time in 1843, Barugo already had 1,744 taxpayers and 8,381 residents. The towns of Alangalang, Jaro, Babatngon, Malibago (?) and [[San Miguel, Leyte|San Miguel]] were once only \"visitas\" of Barugo.\n\nIn Barugo there is a legend which was being taught to elementary pupils during the 1950s and 1960s regarding how the town got its name. The legend goes like this: \"Once upon a time there was a man named Cassadok. One day while he was resting by the river bank under the shade of a giant tree, a Spaniard came along and asked him the name of the place. Cassadok did not understand Spanish and thinking the Spaniard was asking the name of the big shady tree, answered \"Balugo.\" From that time on, the place came to be known as \"Balugo.\" When the Americans came, they changed the letter \"L\" to \"R\" and thus to this day the town is called Barugo.\" This story has no basis in fact and is simply a legend. For the early Spanish historians and chroniclers have always referred to the town by the name it carries today, Barugo.\n\nToday Barugo nestles along the coast of Carigara Bay. But the original settlement of Barugo was way upstream by the banks of the Himanglos River, which during the time of the conquistadores was called Barugo River.\n\nIt is highly probable that the first Barugo settlement was in the place which is now known as Nasunogan, meaning a place burned down. This assumption is born by the fact that the old Spanish road leading to the towns of Tunga and Jaro starts at this place and the ruins of an old Spanish stone church is found there. This assumption is also corroborated, firstly, by the writings of Fr. Chirino wherein he described their travels by foot to Barugo and of a settlement by \"la orilla,\" meaning by the bank of a river and by the mouth of the river. Secondly, the story of Fr. Mateo Sanchez, regarding their attempt to reach a seriously sick man, tells of their travel from the town of Barugo by \"a small boat in which we sailed to seek our sick man, who was living in horon, far from the town and near the coast.\"\n\nFrom Nasunogan, after the old settlement was burned, the people moved to another place which is now called Binongto-an, meaning a place abandoned as a town, now a sitio of Barangay Pikas. The settlers did not stay there long and moved eventually to the present site of the town. This conclusion stems from the fact that lasting structures can be found in Binongto-an.\n\n''(Excerpts from the research Barugo - Its Fabled History, conducted by a prominent Barugon-on, then Joel V.

{"title_page": "Paul Rosbaud", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n'''Paul Rosbaud''' (18 November 1896 &ndash; 28 January 1963), was a [[metallurgist]] and scientific adviser for Springer Verlag in Germany before and during [[World War II]].\nHe continued in science publishing after the war with [[Pergamon Press]] in [[Oxford]], England. In 1986 [[Arnold Kramish]] revealed the [[undercover]] work of Paul Rosbaud for England during the war in the book ''The Griffin''. It was Rosbaud who dispelled anxiety over a \"German atom bomb\".\n\n==Education==\nPaul Rosbaud was born in [[Graz]], Austria. He was an illegitimate son.<ref name=\"F. Seitz, p.47\">N/ Riehl and F. Seitz, ''Stalin's Captive: Nikolaus Riehl and the Soviet Race for the Bomb'', p.47</ref> His mother taught piano lessons, and Paul's brother [[Hans Rosbaud]] became a famous conductor. Rosbaud served in the Austrian army during [[World War I]] from 1915 to 1918. After the war ended his unit was taken as prisoner of war by British forces; this experience ended up giving him a liking of the British. He studied chemistry at [[Darmstadt University of Technology|Darmstadt Technische Hochschule]] beginning in 1920. He continued his studies at [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Institut]] in Berlin. For his doctorate, Rosbaud studied [[metallurgy]] with [[Erich Schmid (physicist)|Erich Schmid]] at [[Berlin-Charlottenburg Technische Hochschule]] and in 1925 wrote \"On strain hardening of crystals in alloys and cold working\",<ref>''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik'' 32:197&ndash;225</ref> a frequently cited article.\nRosbaud then became a \"roving scientific talent scout\"<ref>R.W. Cahn (2004) \"The birth and evolution of ''Physical Metallurgy''\", ''Progress in Materials Science'' 49:221\u201326</ref> for the scientific periodical ''Metallwirtschaft''.\nIn 1932 he began to work for Springer Verlag.<ref name=\"F. Seitz, p.47\"/>\n\n==Spy for Great Britain==\nThrough his work at [[Springer Verlag]], Rosbaud knew much of the scientific community in [[Germany]], and as a presumed [[Nazi]], he had sources of vital intelligence relating to weaponry.\nIn 1935 he began to work for the [[Naturwissenschaften]] review.<ref>Gordon Fraser, ''The Quantum Exodus: Jewish Fugitives, the Atomic Bomb, and the Holocaust'', p.127.</ref> \nIn 1938 he had his Jewish wife Hilde and their only daughter Angela sent to the UK to keep them safe from Nazi harassment. Rosbaud was also invited to stay in the UK, but he decided to keep working in Germany to undermine the Nazi regime. In addition to his own, Rosbaud helped a number of other families flee the Nazis, including that of the well known Jewish physicist [[Lise Meitner]]. He was assisted in his work saving Jews by the fact that he was run as a British agent by [[Frank Foley]], the MI6 station chief in Berlin.\n\n[[Eric Welsh]] and presumably also Foley were Rosbaud's contacts in [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]]/MI6.<ref>Ulstein, Ragnar (1989). ''Etterretningstjenesten i Norge 1940-45.'' Oslo: Cappelen. {{ISBN|8202124018}}.</ref>\n[[File:Victor Goldschmidt OB.F05887a.jpg|thumb|Professor Victor Goldschmidt, the founder of modern [[geochemistry]], was one of Rosbaud's contacts in Oslo. Goldschmidt was of Jewish and bohemian background and in 1942 narrowly escaped deportation to Auschwitz.]]\nBefore the outbreak of war, Rosbaud hurried into print [[Otto Hahn]]'s work on [[nuclear fission]] in the German physics magazine ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'' in January 1939. Paul Rosbaud realized the vast destructive potential of what Hahn, Strassmann, and Meitner had discovered, and he was acutely conscious that the fundamental research had been done in Germany. He wanted the rest of the world to know of the significance of the work at least as soon as the Nazi planners did. By rushing into print with Hahn's manuscript he was able to alert the world community of physicists.<ref>[[Arnold Kramish]] (1986) ''The Griffin: The Greatest Untold Espionage Story of World War II'', page 51, [[Houghton Mifflin]] {{ISBN|0-395-36318-7}}</ref>\n\nRosbaud was in Oslo August 26 to September 16, 1939, a few days before [[Frank Foley]] abandoned Berlin and transferred to Oslo. There he visited [[Victor Goldschmidt]] a geologist that also studied the properties of [[uranium]] and \"super-uranium\" ([[plutonium]]). In Oslo Rosbaud also met [[Odd Hassel]], an old acquaintance. Goldschmidt and Rosbaud were friends and when persecution of Jews in Germany intensified in 1935 Rosbaud helped Goldschmidt abandon G\u00f6ttingen and return to Oslo.

In 1986 [[Arnold Kramish]] revealed the [[undercover]] work of Paul Rosbaud for England during the war in the book ''The Griffin''. It was Rosbaud who dispelled anxiety over a \"German atom bomb\".\n\n==Education==\nPaul Rosbaud was born in [[Graz]], Austria. He was an illegitimate son.<ref name=\"F. Seitz, p.47\">N/ Riehl and F. Seitz, ''Stalin's Captive: Nikolaus Riehl and the Soviet Race for the Bomb'', p.47</ref> His mother taught piano lessons, and Paul's brother [[Hans Rosbaud]] became a famous conductor. Rosbaud served in the Austrian army during [[World War I]] from 1915 to 1918. After the war ended his unit was taken as prisoner of war by British forces; this experience ended up giving him a liking of the British. He studied chemistry at [[Darmstadt University of Technology|Darmstadt Technische Hochschule]] beginning in 1920. He continued his studies at [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Institut]] in Berlin. For his doctorate, Rosbaud studied [[metallurgy]] with [[Erich Schmid (physicist)|Erich Schmid]] at [[Berlin-Charlottenburg Technische Hochschule]] and in 1925 wrote \"On strain hardening of crystals in alloys and cold working\",<ref>''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik'' 32:197&ndash;225</ref> a frequently cited article.\nRosbaud then became a \"roving scientific talent scout\"<ref>R.W. Cahn (2004) \"The birth and evolution of ''Physical Metallurgy''\", ''Progress in Materials Science'' 49:221\u201326</ref> for the scientific periodical ''Metallwirtschaft''.\nIn 1932 he began to work for Springer Verlag.<ref name=\"F. Seitz, p.47\"/>\n\n==Spy for Great Britain==\nThrough his work at [[Springer Verlag]], Rosbaud knew much of the scientific community in [[Germany]], and as a presumed [[Nazi]], he had sources of vital intelligence relating to weaponry.\nIn 1935 he began to work for the [[Naturwissenschaften]] review.<ref>Gordon Fraser, ''The Quantum Exodus: Jewish Fugitives, the Atomic Bomb, and the Holocaust'', p.127.</ref> \nIn 1938 he had his Jewish wife Hilde and their only daughter Angela sent to the UK to keep them safe from Nazi harassment. Rosbaud was also invited to stay in the UK, but he decided to keep working in Germany to undermine the Nazi regime. In addition to his own, Rosbaud helped a number of other families flee the Nazis, including that of the well known Jewish physicist [[Lise Meitner]]. He was assisted in his work saving Jews by the fact that he was run as a British agent by [[Frank Foley]], the MI6 station chief in Berlin.\n\n[[Eric Welsh]] and presumably also Foley were Rosbaud's contacts in [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]]/MI6.<ref>Ulstein, Ragnar (1989).

Goldschmidt was of Jewish and bohemian background and in 1942 narrowly escaped deportation to Auschwitz.]]\nBefore the outbreak of war, Rosbaud hurried into print [[Otto Hahn]]'s work on [[nuclear fission]] in the German physics magazine ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'' in January 1939. Paul Rosbaud realized the vast destructive potential of what Hahn, Strassmann, and Meitner had discovered, and he was acutely conscious that the fundamental research had been done in Germany. He wanted the rest of the world to know of the significance of the work at least as soon as the Nazi planners did. By rushing into print with Hahn's manuscript he was able to alert the world community of physicists.<ref>[[Arnold Kramish]] (1986) ''The Griffin: The Greatest Untold Espionage Story of World War II'', page 51, [[Houghton Mifflin]] {{ISBN|0-395-36318-7}}</ref>\n\nRosbaud was in Oslo August 26 to September 16, 1939, a few days before [[Frank Foley]] abandoned Berlin and transferred to Oslo. There he visited [[Victor Goldschmidt]] a geologist that also studied the properties of [[uranium]] and \"super-uranium\" ([[plutonium]]). In Oslo Rosbaud also met [[Odd Hassel]], an old acquaintance. Goldschmidt and Rosbaud were friends and when persection of Jews in Germany intensified in 1935 Rosbaud helped Goldschmidt abandon G\u00f6ttingen and return to Oslo.

The island has hundreds of pits from these [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], with most in the McCargoe Cove area.  [[Carbon-14]] testing of a charred log found at one of these pits yielded an age of 1,500 B.C.  The [[Jesuit missionary]] Dablon published an account in 1669-70 of \"an island called ''Menong'', celebrated for its copper.\"  ''Menong'', or ''Minong'', was the native term for the island, and is the basis for Minong Ridge.  [[Prospecting]] began in earnest when the [[Chippewas]] relinquished their claims to the island in 1843, starting with many of the original native pits.  This activity had ended by 1855, when no economic deposits were found.  The [[Minong Mine Historic District|Minong Mine]] and Island Mine were the result of renewed but short-lived activity from 1873 to 1881.<ref name=\"Huber\">{{cite book |last1 = Huber |first1 = N.

The fishing industry has declined considerably, but continues at [[Edisen Fishery]].

Just prior to becoming a national park the large mammals on Isle Royale were [[Canada lynx]] and the [[boreal woodland caribou]]. Archeological evidence indicates both of these species were present on Isle Royale for 3,500 years prior to being removed by direct human actions (hunting, trapping, mining, logging, fires, competition for resources from exotic species and possibly disease due to the introduction of invasive species). The last caribou documented on Isle Royale was in 1925. Though lynx were removed by the 1930s some have periodically crossed the ice bridge from neighboring [[Ontario]], Canada, the most recent being an individual sighting in 1980.<ref name=\"npsmammals\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/upload/Mammals_ver7.pdf |title=Mammals on Isle Royale-Historical Context |publisher=National park Service |accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref> Although lynx are no longer present on\nthe island, their primary prey, [[snowshoe hare]]s, remain. Before the appearance of wolves, [[coyote]]s were also predators on the island. Coyotes appeared around 1905 and disappeared shortly after wolves arrived in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Isro-ImageF 00002 rocky shore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rocky shoreline]]\nMoose are believed to have colonized Isle Royale sometime between 1905 and 1912. It was initially believed that a small herd of moose (moose typically do not travel in herds) colonized the islands by crossing the ice from the adjacent mainland; later this theory was modified to a herd of moose swimming 20 miles across [[Lake Superior]] from the nearest mainland. The improbability of these theories received little scrutiny until recent years. Although no thorough scientific investigation to determine how moose arrived on Isle Royale has been carried out to date, both cultural and genetic evidence indicates they were likely introduced by humans to create a private hunting preserve in the early 1900s. The cultural evidence that moose were trapped in northwestern [[Minnesota]] and transported to Isle Royale sounded far fetched to many until decades later when genetic evidence revealed the moose on Isle Royale were more closely related to moose in the far northwestern Minnesota/Manitoba border area than the mainland adjacent to Isle Royale in far northeastern Minnesota bordering Ontario. Further evidence has also shown that the [[Washington Harbor Club]], a group of well-to-do businessmen, owned various buildings on Isle Royale in addition to railroads that ran from [[Baudette]] to [[Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and so had the means to transport moose from northwestern Minnesota to Two Harbors.<ref name=\"npsnature\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/index.htm |title=Isle Royale: Nature & Science |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"gwf\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.georgewright.org/303cochrane.pdf |title=Island Complications: Should We Retain Wolves on Isle Royale? |last=Cochrane |first=Tim |journal=[[George Wright Society#Scope and activities|The George Wright Forum]] |volume=30 |number=3 |pages=313-325 |date=2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are usually around 25 wolves and 1000 moose on the island, but the numbers change greatly year to year.

This is generally done as a 4 or 5 day hike. A boat shuttle can carry hikers back to their starting point. In total there are {{convert|165|mi}} of hiking trails. There are also canoe/kayak routes, many involving portages, along coastal bays and inland lakes.\n\n===Services===\nThe park has two developed areas:\n\n[[Windigo Ranger Station|Windigo]], at the southwest end of the island (docking site for the ferries from [[Minnesota]]), with a campstore, showers, campsites, rustic camper cabins for those wanting to sleep off of the ground and a boat dock.\n\n[[Rock Harbor, Michigan|Rock Harbor]] on the south side of the northeast end (docking site for the ferries from Michigan), with a campstore, showers, restaurant, lodge, campsites, and a boat dock. Non-camping sleeping accommodations at the park are limited to the lodge at Rock Harbor and the camper cabins at Windigo.\n\n====Camping====\nThe park has 36 designated wilderness campgrounds. Some campgrounds in the interior are accessible only by trail or by [[canoe]]/[[kayak]] on the island lakes. Other campgrounds are accessible only by private boat. The campsites vary in capacity but typically include a few three-sided wood shelters (the fourth wall is screened) with floors and roofs, and several individual sites suitable for pitching a small tent. Some tent sites with space for groups of up to 10 are available, and are used for overflow if all the individual sites are filled.\n\nThe only amenities at the campgrounds are pit toilets, picnic tables, and fire-rings at specific areas. Campfires are not permitted at most campgrounds; gas or alcohol camp stoves are recommended. Drinking and cooking water must be drawn from local water sources (Lake Superior and inland lakes) and filtered, treated, or boiled to avoid parasites. Hunting is not permitted, but fishing is, and edible berries ([[Blueberry|blueberries]], [[thimbleberry|thimbleberries]]) may be picked from the trail.\n\n[[File:IsleRoyalePlane.jpg|thumb|right|Floatplane taking off from Windigo on Washington Harbor\u2014Beaver Island can be seen in the background at right]]\n\n===Access===\n{{See also|Isle Royale Ferry Service}}\nThe park is accessible by ferries, floatplanes, and passenger ships during the summer months\u2014from [[Houghton, Michigan|Houghton]] and [[Copper Harbor, Michigan|Copper Harbor]] in Michigan; and [[Grand Portage (community), Minnesota|Grand Portage]] in Minnesota. Private boats travel to the island from the coasts of Michigan, Minnesota, and Ontario.  Isle Royale is quite popular with [[day-tripper]]s in private boats, and day-trip ferry service is provided from Copper Harbor and Grand Portage to and from the park.\n\nIsle Royale is the only American national park to entirely close in the winter months, from November 1 through April 15, due to extreme weather conditions and for the safety and protection of visitors.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/hours.htm Operating Hours & Seasons]</ref> Isle Royale is the least-visited national park in the [[contiguous United States]], due to the winter closing and the distance across Lake Superior to reach the park.

It arrives at Rock Harbor in the park in 3 to 3 1/2 hours, spends 3 1/2 hours before returning to Copper Harbor.\n\nThe ''Sea Hunter'' operates round-trips and offers day trips to the Windigo visitor center through much of the season, and less frequently in early summer and autumn; it will transport kayaks and canoes for visitors wanting to explore the park from the water. It is the fastest ferry serving the island and arrives in 1 1/2 hours, including some sightseeing points along the way out and back. Because of the relatively short boat ride, day visitors are able to get four hours on the island, and get back to the mainland earlier in the afternoon. This gives visitors on a tight schedule time to visit the [[Grand Portage National Monument]] or other attractions in the same day.\n\nThe ''[[Ranger III]]'' is a {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} ship that serves park visitors from Houghton, Michigan to Rock Harbor. It is operated by the National Park Service, and is said to be the largest piece of equipment in the National Park system. It carries 125 passengers, along with canoes, kayaks, and even small powerboats. It is a six-hour voyage from Houghton to the park. The ship stays overnight at Rock Harbor before returning the next day, making two round trips each week from June to mid-September.  Briefly in the 2008 season, the Ranger III carried visitors to and from Windigo. This was not continued after four trips, due to low interest and  long crossing times.  In 2012, Park Superintendent Phyllis Green required the ''Ranger III'' to purify its ballast water.<ref name=JournalSentinelBallast2014-07-24/>\n\nThe ''Voyageur II'', out of Grand Portage, crosses up to three times a week, overnighting at Rock Harbor and providing transportation between popular lakeside campgrounds. In the fall season, in addition to carrying campers and hikers, it provides day-trip service to Windigo on weekends. The Voyageur transports kayaks and canoes for visitors wanting to explore the island from the water. The ''Voyageur II'' and other boat taxi services ferry hikers to points along the island, allowing a one-way hike back to Rock Harbor or Windigo. Visitors may land at Rock Harbor and depart from Windigo several days later, or vice versa.

The island has hundreds of pits from these [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], with most in the McCargoe Cove area.  [[Carbon-14]] testing of a charred log found at one of these pits yielded an age of 1,500 B.C.  The [[Jesuit missionary]] Dablon published an account in 1669-70 of \"an island called ''Menong'', celebrated for its copper.\"  ''Menong'', or ''Minong'', was the native term for the island, and is the basis for Minong Ridge.  [[Prospecting]] began in earnest when the [[Chippewas]] relinquished their claims to the island in 1843, starting with many of the original native pits.  This activity had ended by 1855, when no economic deposits were found.  The [[Minong Mine Historic District|Minong Mine]] and Island Mine were the result of renewed but short-lived activity from 1873 to 1881.<ref name=\"Huber\">{{cite book |last1 = Huber |first1 = N.

The fishing industry has declined considerably, but continues at [[Edisen Fishery]].

Just prior to becoming a national park the large mammals on Isle Royale were [[Canada lynx]] and the [[boreal woodland caribou]]. Archeological evidence indicates both of these species were present on Isle Royale for 3,500 years prior to being removed by direct human actions (hunting, trapping, mining, logging, fires, competition for resources from exotic species and possibly disease due to the introduction of invasive species). The last caribou documented on Isle Royale was in 1925. Though lynx were removed by the 1930s some have periodically crossed the ice bridge from neighboring [[Ontario]], Canada, the most recent being an individual sighting in 1980.<ref name=\"npsmammals\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/upload/Mammals_ver7.pdf |title=Mammals on Isle Royale-Historical Context |publisher=National park Service |accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref> Although lynx are no longer present on\nthe island, their primary prey, [[snowshoe hare]]s, remain. Before the appearance of wolves, [[coyote]]s were also predators on the island. Coyotes appeared around 1905 and disappeared shortly after wolves arrived in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Isro-ImageF 00002 rocky shore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rocky shoreline]]\nMoose are believed to have colonized Isle Royale sometime between 1905 and 1912. It was initially believed that a small herd of moose (moose typically do not travel in herds) colonized the islands by crossing the ice from the adjacent mainland; later this theory was modified to a herd of moose swimming 20 miles across [[Lake Superior]] from the nearest mainland. The improbability of these theories received little scrutiny until recent years. Although no thorough scientific investigation to determine how moose arrived on Isle Royale has been carried out to date, both cultural and genetic evidence indicates they were likely introduced by humans to create a private hunting preserve in the early 1900s. The cultural evidence that moose were trapped in northwestern [[Minnesota]] and transported to Isle Royale sounded far fetched to many until decades later when genetic evidence revealed the moose on Isle Royale were more closely related to moose in the far northwestern Minnesota/Manitoba border area than the mainland adjacent to Isle Royale in far northeastern Minnesota bordering Ontario. Further evidence has also shown that the [[Washington Harbor Club]], a group of well-to-do businessmen, owned various buildings on Isle Royale in addition to railroads that ran from [[Baudette]] to [[Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and so had the means to transport moose from northwestern Minnesota to Two Harbors.<ref name=\"npsnature\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/index.htm |title=Isle Royale: Nature & Science |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"gwf\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.georgewright.org/303cochrane.pdf |title=Island Complications: Should We Retain Wolves on Isle Royale? |last=Cochrane |first=Tim |journal=[[George Wright Society#Scope and activities|The George Wright Forum]] |volume=30 |number=3 |pages=313-325 |date=2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are usually around 25 wolves and 1000 moose on the island, but the numbers change greatly year to year.

The conglomerate [[outcrop]]s on the southwestern portion of the island and consists of [[sedimentary rock]] derived from volcanic rocks in present-day Minnesota.  [[Glacial erosion]] accentuated the ridge and valley topography from pre-glacial stream erosion.  [[Glacial striation]]s indicate a generally westward movement of the glaciers as do the [[recessional moraine]]s west of Lake Desor.

Non-camping sleeping accommodations at the park are limited to the lodge at Rock Harbor and the camper cabins at Windigo.\n\n====Camping====\nThe park has 36 designated wilderness campgrounds. Some campgrounds in the interior are accessible only by trail or by [[canoe]]/[[kayak]] on the island lakes. Other campgrounds are accessible only by private boat. The campsites vary in capacity but typically include a few three-sided wood shelters (the fourth wall is screened) with floors and roofs, and several individual sites suitable for pitching a small tent. Some tent sites with space for groups of up to 10 are available, and are used for overflow if all the individual sites are filled.\n\nThe only amenities at the campgrounds are pit toilets, picnic tables, and fire-rings at specific areas. Campfires are not permitted at most campgrounds; gas or alcohol camp stoves are recommended. Drinking and cooking water must be drawn from local water sources (Lake Superior and inland lakes) and filtered, treated, or boiled to avoid parasites. Hunting is not permitted, but fishing is, and edible berries ([[Blueberry|blueberries]], [[thimbleberry|thimbleberries]]) may be picked from the trail.\n\n[[File:IsleRoyalePlane.jpg|thumb|right|Floatplane taking off from Windigo on Washington Harbor\u2014Beaver Island can be seen in the background at right]]\n\n===Access===\n{{See also|Isle Royale Ferry Service}}\nThe park is accessible by ferries, floatplanes, and passenger ships during the summer months\u2014from [[Houghton, Michigan|Houghton]] and [[Copper Harbor, Michigan|Copper Harbor]] in Michigan; and [[Grand Portage (community), Minnesota|Grand Portage]] in Minnesota.

The average annual visitation was about 19,000 in the period from 2009 to 2018, with 25,798 visiting in 2018.<ref name=\"visits\"/>  It is the least visited national park in the lower 48 states.<ref name = reasonable>  ''A Reasonable Illusion'' by Conor Mihell Sierra Club magazine November/December 2018 issue  Pages 30-35</ref>   Only three of the most remote Alaskan national parks{{mdash}}[[Lake Clark National Park and Preserve|Lake Clark]], [[Kobuk Valley National Park|Kobuk Valley]] and [[Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve|Gates of the Arctic]]{{mdash}}receive fewer visitors.<ref name=\"visits\"/>\n\n===Ships===\nScheduled ferry service operates from Grand Portage, Copper Harbor and Houghton.\n\nThe Grand Portage ferries reach the island in 1 1/2 hours, and stay 4 hours at the island, allowing time for hiking, a guided hike or program by the park staff, and picnics.\n\nThe [[Isle Royale Queen IV|''Isle Royale Queen'']] serves park visitors out of Copper Harbor, on the northern Upper Peninsula coast of Michigan. It arrives at Rock Harbor in the park in 3 to 3 1/2 hours, spends 3 1/2 hours before returning to Copper Harbor.\n\nThe ''Sea Hunter'' operates round-trips and offers day trips to the Windigo visitor center through much of the season, and less frequently in early summer and autumn; it will transport kayaks and canoes for visitors wanting to explore the park from the water. It is the fastest ferry serving the island and arrives in 1 1/2 hours, including some sightseeing points along the way out and back. Because of the relatively short boat ride, day visitors are able to get four hours on the island, and get back to the mainland earlier in the afternoon. This gives visitors on a tight schedule time to visit the [[Grand Portage National Monument]] or other attractions in the same day.\n\nThe ''[[Ranger III]]'' is a {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} ship that serves park visitors from Houghton, Michigan to Rock Harbor. It is operated by the National Park Service, and is said to be the largest piece of equipment in the National Park system. It carries 125 passengers, along with canoes, kayaks, and even small powerboats. It is a six-hour voyage from Houghton to the park. The ship stays overnight at Rock Harbor before returning the next day, making two round trips each week from June to mid-September.  Briefly in the 2008 season, the Ranger III carried visitors to and from Windigo. This was not continued after four trips, due to low interest and  long crossing times.  In 2012, Park Superintendent Phyllis Green required the ''Ranger III'' to purify its ballast water.<ref name=JournalSentinelBallast2014-07-24/>\n\nThe ''Voyageur II'', out of Grand Portage, crosses up to three times a week, overnighting at Rock Harbor and providing transportation between popular lakeside campgrounds. In the fall season, in addition to carrying campers and hikers, it provides day-trip service to Windigo on weekends. The Voyageur transports kayaks and canoes for visitors wanting to explore the island from the water. The ''Voyageur II'' and other boat taxi services ferry hikers to points along the island, allowing a one-way hike back to Rock Harbor or Windigo. Visitors may land at Rock Harbor and depart from Windigo several days later, or vice versa.  Hikers frequently ride it in one direction to do a cross-island hike and then get picked up at the other end.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of islands in Isle Royale National Park]]\n*[[List of fish of Isle Royale National Park]]\n*[[List of birds of Isle Royale National Park]]\n*[[List of shipwrecks of Isle Royale]]\n*[[List of national parks of the United States]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Isle Royale National Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3|refs=\n<ref name=JournalSentinelBallast2014-07-24>{{cite news |url = http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/park-chief-put-foot-down-on-invasive-species-can-others-follow-suit-b99297526z1-267014721.html |title = Park chief put foot down on invasive species.
