The song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year. Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.<ref name=\"UNCUT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656/ |title=Shelter From The Storm \u2013 the inside story of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks |last=Hasted |first=Nick |date=15 November 2013 |work=Uncut |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715011356/https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the Spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was influenced by his tutor [[Norman Raeben]].<ref name=\"UNCUT\" /><ref name=\"Rogovoy2009\">{{cite book|author=Seth Rogovoy|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdbgeObYgIkC&pg=PA160|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5983-2|pages=160\u2013}}</ref> and, in particular, Raeben's view of [[time]].<ref name=\"GillOdegard2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andy Gill|author2=Kevin Odegard|title=A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tt0HAQAAMAAJ|date=January 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81231-6}}</ref> Dylan was later to say that \"Idiot Wind\" was \"a song I wanted to make as a painting.\"<ref name=\"Flanagan2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Flanagan|title=Written in My Soul: Conversations with Rock's Great Songwriters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1081-2|access-date=6 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011534/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Idiot Wind\" was a derogatory phrase employed by Raeben and this may have inspired Dylan's use of it, although the term also appears in the poem ''June 1940'' by [[Weldon Kees]] and that may have been the reference point.<ref name=\"Wilentz2011\">{{cite book|author=Sean Wilentz|title=Bob Dylan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb5UygkZlH0C&pg=PA140|date=15 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-7411-5|pages=140\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDylan first recorded \"Idiot Wind\" in New York City on 12 September 1974 during the initial ''Blood on the Tracks'' sessions at [[A & R Recording|A&R Studios]].

The song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year. Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis around 1858 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis around 1858 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller.

Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov.

He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

Debbie tells him that their affair was a mistake. [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) gives Cameron a job at Emmerdale Haulage and he catches the eye of [[Eve Jenson]] ([[Suzanne Shaw]]). Debbie finally gives into Cameron and they get back together. He also moves into Tug Ghyll with her and her daughter, [[Sarah Sugden Jr|Sarah]] (Sophia Amber Moore), and [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]), Sarah's father, is jealous of Debbie and Cameron's relationship. Cameron also starts a fight with Debbie's father, [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]) and tries to persuade Cain not to interfere in his and Debbie's relationship.\n\nDebbie learns Cameron had another affair after she left Jersey, but he insists it meant nothing and is delighted when Debbie tells him that she is pregnant but miscarries not long afterwards. Cameron tries to support her and not let his feelings show. His sons, [[#Dylan Murray|Dylan]] and [[#Harry Murray|Harry]], come to stay for a few days. Sarah becomes sick and they learn she has a rare genetic disorder. Cameron hires his own truck and starts poaching the King's customers. Carl attacks Cameron's truck and Cameron then plots to ruin the Kings. Cameron, Cain and [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]) steal the Kings' haulage trucks and sell them off. Cameron then wipes all the files containing contracts from Carl's computer. This prompts Cain to tell Cameron he is part of the Dingle clan. Sarah falls ill and Debbie realises that she needs to conceive a saviour sibling with Andy. Cameron is unhappy when he learns they had sex together. Cameron embarks on an affair with Chas Dingle and promises to leave Debbie for her. Carl later discovers the affair and begins blackmailing Cameron and Chas for money. Cameron becomes desperate to raise the amount and he and Chas attempt to rob The Woolpack. Cameron later fights with Carl and hits him over the head with a brick, killing him. Cameron does not admit to killing Carl and Chas is charged with his murder. Consumed with guilt, he confesses the truth to [[Alex Moss]] (Kurtis Stacey). Cameron is then relieved to hear that Chas has been acquitted, but he suspects Alex may go to the police, so he takes Alex hostage in a haulage van. Alex escapes and runs through the woods but Cameron is too quick and catches Alex before dragging him back to the van. As Alex ran, Cameron cannot risk him going to the police so kills him in the van. Cameron is later seen burying Alex in the woods along with his bag of clothes he stole. However, later work begins on the site where Alex is buried so Cameron returns to the gravesite and unearths Alex' decaying corpse and moves it to a different location and burns Alex' bag before returning to the village.\n\nCameron shocks the Dingles' and proposes to Chas and they get engaged. Cameron flies his sons over from Jersey to meet Chas properly but when the boys run and hide at Debbie's, Cameron begins to doubt his choice between Chas and Debbie but when Debbie kidnaps the boys and forces Moira to miscarry, Cameron is shocked when Dylan and Harry refuse to be in the same room with Chas as they believe she killed Carl and Cameron realizes he can never reveal his true secret because of the boys. Cameron and Chas aim to buy the Woolpack but when Cameron's ex-wife Anna refuses to let Cameron see his boys, they are forced to use the money to apply for custody.\n\nCameron begins to feel sorry for Debbie when Andy takes Jack and Sarah away and the pair share a kiss but are almost caught by Chas. Cameron persuades Debbie not to flee and the pair sleep together. He later learns that Debbie almost murdered Chas by holding her a gunpoint whilst he was away in Jersey. Gennie notices a connection between both Cameron and Debbie as they begin to get close again and she tries to get the evidence she needs to prove to Chas that she's right by breaking into Debbie's house to record the pair. However, she gets more than she bargained for as Cameron confesses to the murder of Carl to Debbie. After reconciling their relationship, they both head to the Woolpack to tell Chas that they've reunited but are shocked to see Gennie emerging from the house. They suddenly realise she overheard the confession and chase her. A scared Gennie gets into her car but are quickly pursued by Cameron and Debbie. However, Gennie's car spirals out of control and she's involved in a huge car crash. Panicking, Debbie calls the police while Cameron helps a badly injured Gennie out of wrecked car. Knowing she could expose his secret, Cameron claims his third victim and murders Gennie.\n\nCameron proposes to Debbie and she nearly accepts. but Debbie manages to get Cameron talking about Carl and Gennie's deaths. She tells him that she will forgive him if he tells her what really happened. Cameron then explains how he put his hand over Gennie's mouth and killed her. Debbie screams out a code word and Cameron realises that the police are watching him. He holds Debbie hostage and threatens to kill her. Debbie tries to reason with Cameron, but then she asks if Alex deserved it. Cameron drags Debbie up the stairs, but she pushes him down, injuring him. Debbie escapes and Cameron is arrested.\n\nIn early October 2013, Cameron escapes from prison. Debbie's house is guarded by policemen at all times. Cameron tricks the police in thinking he has escaped to another country by appearing on CCTV at a ferry port, but then moves out the way of the camera and makes his way to Emmerdale. After kidnapping Sarah, he enters The Woolpack with a double barrel shotgun, which he stole from [[Zak Dingle]]'s ([[Steve Halliwell]]) van, which his son [[Sam Dingle|Sam]] ([[James Hooton]]) had parked and holds various villagers at gunpoint. Unbeknownst to him, the gun only has 4 bullets. After threatening to shoot Zak, he accidentally shoots [[Alicia Gallagher|Alicia Harding]] ([[Natalie Anderson]]), one of the hostages. The remaining hostages plead with Cameron to let her go so she can be treated, and he eventually lets her go free with [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]). Finally Cameron lets the rest of the hostages out except for Debbie and Chas, and a dramatic struggle between the three of them causes him to shoot through a window using the last of his bullets. Unaware that all his bullets have gone, he asks Chas and Debbie to decide between them which one should die and counts down from 10. He then had no bullets left but then reloaded the gun. Later on, Marlon woke up and knocked Cameron out and held him at gunpoint as Debbie and Chas tried to escape through the cellar. After the power kept going on and off Cameron and Marlon struggled and Cameron was presumably shot in the process only to appear in the cellar later on. He tried numerous times to drown Debbie, Chas and Marlon. Marlon later escaped and the police then finally broke into the pub as they tried to get rescue Debbie and Chas by cutting into the cellar, Chas was able to escape but Cameron captured Debbie once more. He then attempted to drown her, but she escaped. He tried to grab Debbie's leg once more, but fails and ends up grabbing onto a light bulb - which electrocutes Cameron to death as a result and his reign of terror at Emmerdale is finally over. The following morning, his body is taken away and Debbie makes peace with Chas so that the pair can move on with their lives without Cameron.\n\nThe character is subsequently referenced as time goes on, most specifically when Cameron's voice is later heard by Chas from late November 2015 - after she accidentally stabs Diane.\n\n==Elliot Windsor==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Emmerdale\n|name= Elliot Windsor\n|introducer= Stuart Blackburn\n|portrayer = Oliver Brooke (2011) <br> Jackson Charles Cummins (2012) <br> Luca Hoyle (2016\u2013)\n|years= 2011\u20132012, 2016\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Recurring characters|Present; recurring]]\n|first= 28 March 2011\n|last=\n|father = [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy King]]\n|mother = [[Kelly Windsor]]\n|stepmother = [[Nicola King]]\n|halfbrothers = [[Carl Holliday]]\n|halfsisters = [[Angelica King]]\n|grandfathers = [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] <br> [[Vic Windsor]]\n|uncles = [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]] <br> [[Carl King]] <br> [[Max King (Emmerdale)|Max King]]\n|aunts = [[Donna Windsor]] <br> [[Scarlett Nicholls]]\n|cousins = [[Anya King]] <br> [[Thomas King (Emmerdale)|Thomas King]] <br> [[April Windsor]]\n|relatives = [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Phyllis King|Phyllis King]]\n}}\n\n'''Elliot Windsor''' made his first on screen appearance on 28 March 2011.

However, Rachel is forced to apologize when she learns Amelia was actually the bully. Rachel and Sam then become friends. Rachel's nephew, [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]), finds her and admits stealing money from the garage and [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) collapsed while chasing him. Rachel is angered when Aaron's mother, [[Chas Dingle|Chas]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]), threatens Sean and tells him to stay away from Aaron.\n\nRachel gets a job in [[The Woolpack]] and works with [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and develops feelings for him but he lets her down gently because of his feelings for [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]). Rachel tells Sam she is interested in Brook Cottage but [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) tells Rachel she cannot rent it. Rachel shows her sister, [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), around the cottage and they rent the house. Rachel, Ali, Amelia, Sean and Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), move into Brook Cottage. Rachel starts work as a cleaner at the Sharmas' sweet factory. She sees Jai drinking after a row with his wife and he invites her to join him, which she does and this leads to them having a drunken one night stand. A month or so later, Rachel learns that she's pregnant. Jai is initially shocked but warms to the idea. He stops her having an abortion and offers her a place to live in Leeds. Rachel thinks he is doing it for their child but realizes that he wants her out of the way so his wife won't ask questions. She initially moves in but is lonely and returns to the village. In December 2012, Rachel goes into premature labour and has a son, Archie, supported by Ruby. Jai realizes that he wants to be a proper father and is jealous of Sam spending time with Archie but Rachel is grateful and slaps Jai when he calls Sam stupid. She later realizes she has feelings for Sam, dismaying Lisa Dingle, Ruby and Ali but Samson and Amelia are happy and sends a card to Rachel, pretending to be Sam, leading Rachel to admit her feelings. They get together and Rachel and Archie move in with Sam and Samson and are happy, even after it is revealed that Jai is Archie's father. The Dingles are not pleased and Charity asks Jai to choose: her or Archie. He initially chooses her and suggests that they leave the village and everyone in it behind but Charity refuses to leave Debbie and Sarah. Jai realizes that he cannot live in the same village as his son and not be part of his life. Angered by this, Charity and Noah move in with Debbie and Sarah before filing for divorce. When she catches Declan Macey setting fire to Home Farm and intending to commit suicide, she tries to talk him out of it and he does change his mind. Seeing an opportunity to get rid of Rachel and Archie, she persuades Declan to help her frame Sam, thinking Sam, Rachel, Samson and Archie will go on the run but Rachel insists they stay and Sam clear his name legally so Charity blackmails her to tell the police that she set the fire and then go on the run.\n\nRachel returns as a prosecution witness at [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]]'s ([[Emma Atkins]]) trial for fraud and reconciles with Sam. They move back in together but Rachel now has significant anger management issues and her arguments with Sam turn physical, especially after Jai starts residency proceedings. He is understandably scared of her and Archie leaving again but Rachel is horrified to learn that, in her absence, Jai bought a little boy that he thought was Archie. The child was revealed to be the son of the man who sold him to Jai when Rachel returned with the real Archie. Unfortunately for Jai, his plan to find out what is happening to Archie when he is with Rachel and Sam backfires when Rachel finds the camera and footage of him and his girlfriend, Leyla, discussing their plans for a family life once he has residency and to divorce Megan. Sam and Rachel show the footage to Megan, who plans revenge and quietly starts helping Rachel whenever Jai tries to play tricks on her. Megan does her best including planting drugs in Jai's car, however unknown to Rachel, Megan discovers she is pregnant a few days before the hearing. Unable to forgive Jai for his infidelity, Megan leaves Jai and helps Rachel win Archie back successfully. Rachel, still stressed, keeps losing her temper and hitting Sam. When Ali discovers what Rachel has been doing to Sam, she demands that Rachel go with her to Liverpool and get treatment before she starts hitting Archie too. Rachel agrees and she and Sam part on good terms. Rachel is stunned to hear of Megan's pregnancy and she, Archie and Ali leave the village, heading for a better life. Rachel dies four years later and Dan brings Archie back to the village to live with Jai.\n\n==Amelia Spencer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Amelia Spencer\n|portrayer = Daisy Campbell\n|introducer = Stuart Blackburn\n|years = 2011\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Regular characters|Present; regular]]\n|first = 19 July 2011\n|home = Dale Head\n|occupation = Student\n|father = [[Daz Spencer]]\n|mother = [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]\n|adoptivefather = [[#Dan Spencer|Dan Spencer]]\n|uncles = <!--Even though Dan is now revealed to be her biological uncle, he is more of a father (bar the biology) to her than Daz has been at present in storylines and their father/daughter relationship is far more significant.

Rachel makes Amelia say sorry to Samson when it turns out she was the one doing the bullying and is enrolled in the summer club run by [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) and there, makes friends with the other children. Amelia's family; mother [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), Ali's girlfriend [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]) and her older brother [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]) move into Brook Cottage. Amelia gets fed up of Sean arguing with Ruby and runs away, straight into the path of [[Carl King]]'s ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) van. However, she is pulled out of the way in time by Sam. Amelia is happy when her father, Dan, turns up in the village to see her and Sean.\n\nAmelia decides she wants to believe in God and announces to her mum that she wants to be christened. A few days before her christening day, Amelia changes her mind because two girls at the summer club are bullying her over her mother being a [[lesbian]], which Sean finds amusing. After Ali talks to her, the christening goes ahead as planned. Amelia is a bridesmaid at her father's wedding to [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]). When Chas is later arrested for the murder of Carl, Amelia makes a dummy of her and attempts to throw it on the bonfire. Amelia auditions for the part of Mary in the [[nativity play|nativity]] play at the church. She begs the vicar for the part and on purpose sings louder than the other children. Amelia later meets her baby cousin Archie after Rachel goes into premature labour. Amelia was also a bridesmaid for her father, Dan, and [[Kerry Wyatt]]'s ([[Laura Norton]]) wedding. However, it was later discovered that Kerry was already married but she did not think it was valid since it was in Las Vegas.\n\nIn April 2018, Amelia learns that her mum Ali had died following a car crash in [[Liverpool]], hearing the news from her uncle [[Daz Spencer|Daz]] ([[Mark Jordon]]). Later, Daz drunkenly admits to Kerry that he had a one-night stand with Ali twelve years previously, and Amelia could be his daughter, which was confirmed by a DNA test to be true, whilst Dan and Amelia go to Liverpool to attend Ali's funeral. Amelia later accidentally learns the news that Daz is her biological father and after trying to stop Dan and Daz fighting, she goes missing. Amelia is later found to have been living with Beth, the daughter of a soldier that Daz accidentally shot dead during a firearms handling exercise whilst they were both serving in the [[British Army|army]] in Afghanistan in 2009. Beth wants revenge on Daz, and contacted Amelia via an online chatroom, befriending her, and turning her against her family in person, as well as framing Daz for kidnapping. When [[Bernice Blackstock]] lured Beth to the cricket pavilion and had her arrested on kidnapping, attempted extortion and perverting the course of justice, Amelia protests that Daz should be imprisoned. Amelia is reunited with her family at this point, who assure her that they all love her no matter what. Amelia still tries to contact Beth, through such means as stealing [[Harriet Finch]]'s mobile. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sean Spencer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Sean Spencer\n|portrayer = [[Luke Roskell]]\n|introducer = Stuart Blackburn (2011)<br/>[[Kate Oates]] (2014)\n|years = 2011\u20132014\n|classification = [[List of past Emmerdale characters#Last appeared in 2014|Former; regular]]\n|first = 10 August 2011\n|last = 5 December 2014\n|home = Liverpool\n|occupation = Student<br />Soldier\n|father = [[#Dan Spencer|Dan Spencer]]\n|mother = [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]\n|stepmother= [[Chas Dingle]] (2012\u20132013)<br />[[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] (2014\u20132015) wife Gavin Ellis \n|halfsisters = [[#Amelia Spencer|Amelia Spencer]]\n|aunts = Karen Spencer<br>[[#Rachel Breckle|Rachel Breckle]]\n|uncles = [[Daz Spencer]]\n|cousins = [[Archie Breckle]]\n}}\n'''Sean Spencer''', played by [[Luke Roskell]], made his first on screen appearance on 10 August 2011.<ref name=\"RubyAli\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a332108/emmerdale-announces-new-characters-ali-and-ruby.html|title='Emmerdale' announces new characters Ali and Ruby|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=28 July 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/spoilers/a332368/aaron-has-another-furious-outburst-at-the-pub.html|title=Aaron has another furious outburst at the pub|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref> Roskell's casting was announced in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiepalmeragency.co.uk/news/2011/06/24/emmerdale|title=Emmerdale|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Jackie Palmer Stage School|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> Sean is [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]'s ([[Kelli Hollis]]) son and [[#Amelia Spencer|Amelia]]'s (Daisy Campbell) older brother.<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> Much to his horror, Sean's mother left his father for [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]).<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> Sean is not happy that his mother has come out as a lesbian and she is no longer with his father.<ref name=\"SSpencer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/sean-spencer/|title=Sean Spencer|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> Sean enjoys winding Ruby up.<ref name=\"SSpencer\"/> Sean has been described as a \"tearaway.\"<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> The official ''Emmerdale'' website said Sean is typical teenager, full of attitude and hates being told what to do.

Ali comes to view it and tells Rachel that she really likes it, so they visit [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]) and ask if she can rent the cottage. Former occupant, [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) overhears and isn't happy when Declan agrees. Ali soon returns to the village with Rachel and her children, Amelia and Sean, to move in but Sean is unhappy when Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), joins them. While Ali and Ruby are moving their stuff, Sean and Ruby argue about how much life would be better without her around and consequently no one notices Amelia disappearing and is nearly run over by [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]). Luckily [[Cameron Murray (Emmerdale)|Cameron Murray]] ([[Dominic Power]]), catches Amelia before she is harmed. Amelia's family run to her and Ali thanks Cameron for saving Amelia and punches Carl for not looking where he is going. However, Ali later learns that Cameron caused the accident, wanting revenge on Carl, so Ali makes them move furniture into Brook Cottage and both men are surprised to discover that Ali and Ruby are lesbians.\n\nAli gets a job at the Sharma and Sharma sweet factory and befriends [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]). When Lisa learns her daughter, [[Belle Dingle|Belle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]), is seeing Sean, she asks Ali to keep him away. Ali struggles to pay the rent and asks Nicola for an extension, which is refused. Ali and Ruby begin drifting apart and things worsen when Ruby suggests moving back to Hotten. Ruby eventually admits having some savings that she planned to use to move away but Ali accuses her of trying to run away but Ruby insists she wants to stay with Ali and her family and asks Ali to divorce Dan but she makes excuses not to. When Sean asks Ali to read his school project, she reveals that she cannot read or write, admitting that she rarely went to school and the teachers didn't help. Ali is asked to cover for Lisa when she has to collect Samson from school because he is ill and accidentally sends a customer the wrong order. Initially, she blames Lisa but when Lisa is suspended, Ali admits to [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) and [[Nikhil Sharma]] ([[Rik Makarem]]) that she [[Literacy#Illiteracy|cannot read]]. They insist she attends an adult literacy course if she wants to keep her job and all goes well until Ali notices another child wearing Sean's trainers and demands he return them. When he refuses, she knocks him over and is removing them herself but is stopped by the staff. The child's parents decline to press charges but the staff ban Ali from the school grounds, so Ruby takes over as Ali's teacher.\n\nIn summer 2012, she discovers that Rachel is pregnant and is unsure what to do next. Ali supports her but is frustrated by Rachel's refusal to name the father of her child and when village gossip accuses David Metcalfe, she attacks him in the Woolpack. Rachel, however, is horrified and demands Ali apologise to him in the Woolpack and accept that Rachel will handle the situation her way or she will leave. Ali accepts it reluctantly and is pleased when Rachel moves into Tenant's Cottage in the village. She, Ruby and the children live quietly for a while until Declan's sister, [[Megan Macey]], takes a shine to the cottage and gives them notice to quit as she plans to live there with her son, [[Robbie Lawson (Emmerdale)|Robbie Lawson]]. When Declan learns of this, he is not pleased and tells Megan to withdraw the notice to quit but she and Zak Dingle go to measure up. Ali visits Declan and tells him what has happened and they return to the cottage, just in time to see Rachel slap Megan. Megan threatens to call the police unless Ali and her family vacate the cottage within 24 hours, which they do and move in with Rachel.\n\nIn April 2015, Dan and Ali drive to Liverpool after discovering that Sean has been involved in a car accident with his friends. When they arrive back home, it is implied that Sean's injuries sustained during the crash are serious and Ali decides to stay in Liverpool until he recovers and Ruby stays in the village to ensure a steady income for the family. In August 2015, Ali returns to the village after Ruby is killed in the helicopter crash at Pete and Debbie's wedding.

Debbie tells him that their affair was a mistake. [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) gives Cameron a job at Emmerdale Haulage and he catches the eye of [[Eve Jenson]] ([[Suzanne Shaw]]). Debbie finally gives into Cameron and they get back together. He also moves into Tug Ghyll with her and her daughter, [[Sarah Sugden Jr|Sarah]] (Sophia Amber Moore), and [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]), Sarah's father, is jealous of Debbie and Cameron's relationship. Cameron also starts a fight with Debbie's father, [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]) and tries to persuade Cain not to interfere in his and Debbie's relationship.\n\nDebbie learns Cameron had another affair after she left Jersey, but he insists it meant nothing and is delighted when Debbie tells him that she is pregnant but miscarries not long afterwards. Cameron tries to support her and not let his feelings show. His sons, [[#Dylan Murray|Dylan]] and [[#Harry Murray|Harry]], come to stay for a few days. Sarah becomes sick and they learn she has a rare genetic disorder. Cameron hires his own truck and starts poaching the King's customers. Carl attacks Cameron's truck and Cameron then plots to ruin the Kings. Cameron, Cain and [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]) steal the Kings' haulage trucks and sell them off. Cameron then wipes all the files containing contracts from Carl's computer. This prompts Cain to tell Cameron he is part of the Dingle clan. Sarah falls ill and Debbie realises that she needs to conceive a saviour sibling with Andy. Cameron is unhappy when he learns they had sex together. Cameron embarks on an affair with Chas Dingle and promises to leave Debbie for her. Carl later discovers the affair and begins blackmailing Cameron and Chas for money. Cameron becomes desperate to raise the amount and he and Chas attempt to rob The Woolpack. Cameron later fights with Carl and hits him over the head with a brick, killing him. Cameron does not admit to killing Carl and Chas is charged with his murder. Consumed with guilt, he confesses the truth to [[Alex Moss]] (Kurtis Stacey). Cameron is then relieved to hear that Chas has been acquitted, but he suspects Alex may go to the police, so he takes Alex hostage in a haulage van. Alex escapes and runs through the woods but Cameron is too quick and catches Alex before dragging him back to the van. As Alex ran, Cameron cannot risk him going to the police so kills him in the van. Cameron is later seen burying Alex in the woods along with his bag of clothes he stole. However, later work begins on the site where Alex is buried so Cameron returns to the gravesite and unearths Alex' decaying corpse and moves it to a different location and burns Alex' bag before returning to the village.\n\nCameron shocks the Dingles' and proposes to Chas and they get engaged. Cameron flies his sons over from Jersey to meet Chas properly but when the boys run and hide at Debbie's, Cameron begins to doubt his choice between Chas and Debbie but when Debbie kidnaps the boys and forces Moira to miscarry, Cameron is shocked when Dylan and Harry refuse to be in the same room with Chas as they believe she killed Carl and Cameron realizes he can never reveal his true secret because of the boys. Cameron and Chas aim to buy the Woolpack but when Cameron's ex-wife Anna refuses to let Cameron see his boys, they are forced to use the money to apply for custody.\n\nCameron begins to feel sorry for Debbie when Andy takes Jack and Sarah away and the pair share a kiss but are almost caught by Chas. Cameron persuades Debbie not to flee and the pair sleep together. He later learns that Debbie almost murdered Chas by holding her a gunpoint whilst he was away in Jersey. Gennie notices a connection between both Cameron and Debbie as they begin to get close again and she tries to get the evidence she needs to prove to Chas that she's right by breaking into Debbie's house to record the pair. However, she gets more than she bargained for as Cameron confesses to the murder of Carl to Debbie. After reconciling their relationship, they both head to the Woolpack to tell Chas that they've reunited but are shocked to see Gennie emerging from the house. They suddenly realise she overheard the confession and chase her. A scared Gennie gets into her car but are quickly pursued by Cameron and Debbie. However, Gennie's car spirals out of control and she's involved in a huge car crash. Panicking, Debbie calls the police while Cameron helps a badly injured Gennie out of wrecked car. Knowing she could expose his secret, Cameron claims his third victim and murders Gennie.\n\nCameron proposes to Debbie and she nearly accepts. but Debbie manages to get Cameron talking about Carl and Gennie's deaths. She tells him that she will forgive him if he tells her what really happened. Cameron then explains how he put his hand over Gennie's mouth and killed her. Debbie screams out a code word and Cameron realises that the police are watching him. He holds Debbie hostage and threatens to kill her. Debbie tries to reason with Cameron, but then she asks if Alex deserved it. Cameron drags Debbie up the stairs, but she pushes him down, injuring him. Debbie escapes and Cameron is arrested.\n\nIn early October 2013, Cameron escapes from prison. Debbie's house is guarded by policemen at all times. Cameron tricks the police in thinking he has escaped to another country by appearing on CCTV at a ferry port, but then moves out the way of the camera and makes his way to Emmerdale. After kidnapping Sarah, he enters The Woolpack with a double barrel shotgun, which he stole from [[Zak Dingle]]'s ([[Steve Halliwell]]) van, which his son [[Sam Dingle|Sam]] ([[James Hooton]]) had parked and holds various villagers at gunpoint. Unbeknownst to him, the gun only has 4 bullets. After threatening to shoot Zak, he accidentally shoots [[Alicia Gallagher|Alicia Harding]] ([[Natalie Anderson]]), one of the hostages. The remaining hostages plead with Cameron to let her go so she can be treated, and he eventually lets her go free with [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]). Finally Cameron lets the rest of the hostages out except for Debbie and Chas, and a dramatic struggle between the three of them causes him to shoot through a window using the last of his bullets. Unaware that all his bullets have gone, he asks Chas and Debbie to decide between them which one should die and counts down from 10. He then had no bullets left but then reloaded the gun. Later on, Marlon woke up and knocked Cameron out and held him at gunpoint as Debbie and Chas tried to escape through the cellar. After the power kept going on and off Cameron and Marlon struggled and Cameron was presumably shot in the process only to appear in the cellar later on. He tried numerous times to drown Debbie, Chas and Marlon. Marlon later escaped and the police then finally broke into the pub as they tried to get rescue Debbie and Chas by cutting into the cellar, Chas was able to escape but Cameron captured Debbie once more. He then attempted to drown her, but she escaped. He tried to grab Debbie's leg once more, but fails and ends up grabbing onto a light bulb - which electrocutes Cameron to death as a result and his reign of terror at Emmerdale is finally over. The following morning, his body is taken away and Debbie makes peace with Chas so that the pair can move on with their lives without Cameron.\n\nThe character is subsequently referenced as time goes on, most specifically when Cameron's voice is later heard by Chas from late November 2015 - after she accidentally stabs Diane.\n\n==Elliot Windsor==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Emmerdale\n|name= Elliot Windsor\n|introducer= Stuart Blackburn\n|portrayer = Oliver Brooke (2011) <br> Jackson Charles Cummins (2012) <br> Luca Hoyle (2016\u2013)\n|years= 2011\u20132012, 2016\u2013\n|classification = [[List of Emmerdale characters#Recurring characters|Present; recurring]]\n|first= 28 March 2011\n|last=\n|father = [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy King]]\n|mother = [[Kelly Windsor]]\n|stepmother = [[Nicola King]]\n|halfbrothers = [[Carl Holliday]]\n|halfsisters = [[Angelica King]]\n|grandfathers = [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] <br> [[Vic Windsor]]\n|uncles = [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]] <br> [[Carl King]] <br> [[Max King (Emmerdale)|Max King]]\n|aunts = [[Donna Windsor]] <br> [[Scarlett Nicholls]]\n|cousins = [[Anya King]] <br> [[Thomas King (Emmerdale)|Thomas King]] <br> [[April Windsor]]\n|relatives = [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Phyllis King|Phyllis King]]\n}}\n\n'''Elliot Windsor''' made his first on screen appearance on 28 March 2011.

Rachel is angered when Aaron's mother, [[Chas Dingle|Chas]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]), threatens Sean and tells him to stay away from Aaron.\n\nRachel gets a job in [[The Woolpack]] and works with [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and develops feelings for him but he lets her down gently because of his feelings for [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]). Rachel tells Sam she is interested in Brook Cottage but [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) tells Rachel she cannot rent it. Rachel shows her sister, [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), around the cottage and they rent the house. Rachel, Ali, Amelia, Sean and Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), move into Brook Cottage. Rachel starts work as a cleaner at the Sharmas' sweet factory. She sees Jai drinking after a row with his wife and he invites her to join him, which she does and this leads to them having a drunken one night stand. A month or so later, Rachel learns that she's pregnant. Jai is initially shocked but warms to the idea. He stops her having an abortion and offers her a place to live in Leeds. Rachel thinks he is doing it for their child but realizes that he wants her out of the way so his wife won't ask questions. She initially moves in but is lonely and returns to the village. In December 2012, Rachel goes into premature labour and has a son, Archie, supported by Ruby. Jai realizes that he wants to be a proper father and is jealous of Sam spending time with Archie but Rachel is grateful and slaps Jai when he calls Sam stupid. She later realizes she has feelings for Sam, dismaying Lisa Dingle, Ruby and Ali but Samson and Amelia are happy and sends a card to Rachel, pretending to be Sam, leading Rachel to admit her feelings. They get together and Rachel and Archie move in with Sam and Samson and are happy, even after it is revealed that Jai is Archie's father. The Dingles are not pleased and Charity asks Jai to choose: her or Archie. He initially chooses her and suggests that they leave the village and everyone in it behind but Charity refuses to leave Debbie and Sarah. Jai realizes that he cannot live in the same village as his son and not be part of his life. Angered by this, Charity and Noah move in with Debbie and Sarah before filing for divorce. When she catches Declan Macey setting fire to Home Farm and intending to commit suicide, she tries to talk him out of it and he does change his mind. Seeing an opportunity to get rid of Rachel and Archie, she persuades Declan to help her frame Sam, thinking Sam, Rachel, Samson and Archie will go on the run but Rachel insists they stay and Sam clear his name legally so Charity blackmails her to tell the police that she set the fire and then go on the run.\n\nRachel returns as a prosecution witness at [[Charity Tate|Charity Dingle]]'s ([[Emma Atkins]]) trial for fraud and reconciles with Sam. They move back in together but Rachel now has significant anger management issues and her arguments with Sam turn physical, especially after Jai starts residency proceedings. He is understandably scared of her and Archie leaving again but Rachel is horrified to learn that, in her absence, Jai bought a little boy that he thought was Archie. The child was revealed to be the son of the man who sold him to Jai when Rachel returned with the real Archie. Unfortunately for Jai, his plan to find out what is happening to Archie when he is with Rachel and Sam backfires when Rachel finds the camera and footage of him and his girlfriend, Leyla, discussing their plans for a family life once he has residency and to divorce Megan. Sam and Rachel show the footage to Megan, who plans revenge and quietly starts helping Rachel whenever Jai tries to play tricks on her. Megan does her best including planting drugs in Jai's car, however unknown to Rachel, Megan discovers she is pregnant a few days before the hearing. Unable to forgive Jai for his infidelity, Megan leaves Jai and helps Rachel win Archie back successfully. Rachel, still stressed, keeps losing her temper and hitting Sam.

Rachel makes Amelia say sorry to Samson when it turns out she was the one doing the bullying and is enrolled in the summer club run by [[Marlon Dingle]] ([[Mark Charnock]]) and [[Laurel Potts|Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) and there, makes friends with the other children. Amelia's family; mother [[#Ali Spencer|Ali]] ([[Kelli Hollis]]), Ali's girlfriend [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]) and her older brother [[#Sean Spencer|Sean]] ([[Luke Roskell]]) move into Brook Cottage. Amelia gets fed up of Sean arguing with Ruby and runs away, straight into the path of [[Carl King]]'s ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]) van. However, she is pulled out of the way in time by Sam. Amelia is happy when her father, Dan, turns up in the village to see her and Sean.\n\nAmelia decides she wants to believe in God and announces to her mum that she wants to be christened. A few days before her christening day, Amelia changes her mind because two girls at the summer club are bullying her over her mother being a [[lesbian]], which Sean finds amusing. After Ali talks to her, the christening goes ahead as planned. Amelia is a bridesmaid at her father's wedding to [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]). When Chas is later arrested for the murder of Carl, Amelia makes a dummy of her and attempts to throw it on the bonfire. Amelia auditions for the part of Mary in the [[nativity play|nativity]] play at the church. She begs the vicar for the part and on purpose sings louder than the other children. Amelia later meets her baby cousin Archie after Rachel goes into premature labour. Amelia was also a bridesmaid for her father, Dan, and [[Kerry Wyatt]]'s ([[Laura Norton]]) wedding. However, it was later discovered that Kerry was already married but she did not think it was valid since it was in Las Vegas.\n\nIn April 2018, Amelia learns that her mum Ali had died following a car crash in [[Liverpool]], hearing the news from her uncle [[Daz Spencer|Daz]] ([[Mark Jordon]]). Later, Daz drunkenly admits to Kerry that he had a one-night stand with Ali twelve years previously, and Amelia could be his daughter, which was confirmed by a DNA test to be true, whilst Dan and Amelia go to Liverpool to attend Ali's funeral. Amelia later accidentally learns the news that Daz is her biological father and after trying to stop Dan and Daz fighting, she goes missing. Amelia is later found to have been living with Beth, the daughter of a soldier that Daz accidentally shot dead during a firearms handling exercise whilst they were both serving in the [[British Army|army]] in Afghanistan in 2009. Beth wants revenge on Daz, and contacted Amelia via an online chatroom, befriending her, and turning her against her family in person, as well as framing Daz for kidnapping. When [[Bernice Blackstock]] lured Beth to the cricket pavilion and had her arrested on kidnapping, attempted extortion and perverting the course of justice, Amelia protests that Daz should be imprisoned. Amelia is reunited with her family at this point, who assure her that they all love her no matter what. Amelia still tries to contact Beth, through such means as stealing [[Harriet Finch]]'s mobile. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Sean Spencer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Emmerdale\n|name = Sean Spencer\n|portrayer = [[Luke Roskell]]\n|introducer = Stuart Blackburn (2011)<br/>[[Kate Oates]] (2014)\n|years = 2011\u20132014\n|classification = [[List of past Emmerdale characters#Last appeared in 2014|Former; regular]]\n|first = 10 August 2011\n|last = 5 December 2014\n|home = Liverpool\n|occupation = Student<br />Soldier\n|father = [[#Dan Spencer|Dan Spencer]]\n|mother = [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]\n|stepmother= [[Chas Dingle]] (2012\u20132013)<br />[[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] (2014\u20132015) wife Gavin Ellis \n|halfsisters = [[#Amelia Spencer|Amelia Spencer]]\n|aunts = Karen Spencer<br>[[#Rachel Breckle|Rachel Breckle]]\n|uncles = [[Daz Spencer]]\n|cousins = [[Archie Breckle]]\n}}\n'''Sean Spencer''', played by [[Luke Roskell]], made his first on screen appearance on 10 August 2011.<ref name=\"RubyAli\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a332108/emmerdale-announces-new-characters-ali-and-ruby.html|title='Emmerdale' announces new characters Ali and Ruby|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=28 July 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/spoilers/a332368/aaron-has-another-furious-outburst-at-the-pub.html|title=Aaron has another furious outburst at the pub|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref> Roskell's casting was announced in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiepalmeragency.co.uk/news/2011/06/24/emmerdale|title=Emmerdale|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Jackie Palmer Stage School|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> Sean is [[#Ali Spencer|Ali Spencer]]'s ([[Kelli Hollis]]) son and [[#Amelia Spencer|Amelia]]'s (Daisy Campbell) older brother.<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> Much to his horror, Sean's mother left his father for [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]).<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> Sean is not happy that his mother has come out as a lesbian and she is no longer with his father.<ref name=\"SSpencer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/sean-spencer/|title=Sean Spencer|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> Sean enjoys winding Ruby up.<ref name=\"SSpencer\"/> Sean has been described as a \"tearaway.\"<ref name=\"RubyAli\"/> The official ''Emmerdale'' website said Sean is typical teenager, full of attitude and hates being told what to do.

Ali is fully committed to Ruby and did not take the decision to leave her husband lightly.<ref name=\"KelliH\"/>\n\nAli first comes to the village when her sister, Rachel, tells her about a cottage for rent in the village. Ali comes to view it and tells Rachel that she really likes it, so they visit [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]) and ask if she can rent the cottage. Former occupant, [[Nicola King]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]) overhears and isn't happy when Declan agrees. Ali soon returns to the village with Rachel and her children, Amelia and Sean, to move in but Sean is unhappy when Ali's girlfriend, [[#Ruby Haswell|Ruby Haswell]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), joins them. While Ali and Ruby are moving their stuff, Sean and Ruby argue about how much life would be better without her around and consequently no one notices Amelia disappearing and is nearly run over by [[Carl King]] ([[Tom Lister (actor)|Tom Lister]]). Luckily [[Cameron Murray (Emmerdale)|Cameron Murray]] ([[Dominic Power]]), catches Amelia before she is harmed. Amelia's family run to her and Ali thanks Cameron for saving Amelia and punches Carl for not looking where he is going. However, Ali later learns that Cameron caused the accident, wanting revenge on Carl, so Ali makes them move furniture into Brook Cottage and both men are surprised to discover that Ali and Ruby are lesbians.\n\nAli gets a job at the Sharma and Sharma sweet factory and befriends [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]). When Lisa learns her daughter, [[Belle Dingle|Belle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]), is seeing Sean, she asks Ali to keep him away. Ali struggles to pay the rent and asks Nicola for an extension, which is refused. Ali and Ruby begin drifting apart and things worsen when Ruby suggests moving back to Hotten. Ruby eventually admits having some savings that she planned to use to move away but Ali accuses her of trying to run away but Ruby insists she wants to stay with Ali and her family and asks Ali to divorce Dan but she makes excuses not to. When Sean asks Ali to read his school project, she reveals that she cannot read or write, admitting that she rarely went to school and the teachers didn't help. Ali is asked to cover for Lisa when she has to collect Samson from school because he is ill and accidentally sends a customer the wrong order. Initially, she blames Lisa but when Lisa is suspended, Ali admits to [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) and [[Nikhil Sharma]] ([[Rik Makarem]]) that she [[Literacy#Illiteracy|cannot read]]. They insist she attends an adult literacy course if she wants to keep her job and all goes well until Ali notices another child wearing Sean's trainers and demands he return them. When he refuses, she knocks him over and is removing them herself but is stopped by the staff. The child's parents decline to press charges but the staff ban Ali from the school grounds, so Ruby takes over as Ali's teacher.\n\nIn summer 2012, she discovers that Rachel is pregnant and is unsure what to do next. Ali supports her but is frustrated by Rachel's refusal to name the father of her child and when village gossip accuses David Metcalfe, she attacks him in the Woolpack. Rachel, however, is horrified and demands Ali apologise to him in the Woolpack and accept that Rachel will handle the situation her way or she will leave. Ali accepts it reluctantly and is pleased when Rachel moves into Tenant's Cottage in the village. She, Ruby and the children live quietly for a while until Declan's sister, [[Megan Macey]], takes a shine to the cottage and gives them notice to quit as she plans to live there with her son, [[Robbie Lawson (Emmerdale)|Robbie Lawson]]. When Declan learns of this, he is not pleased and tells Megan to withdraw the notice to quit but she and Zak Dingle go to measure up. Ali visits Declan and tells him what has happened and they return to the cottage, just in time to see Rachel slap Megan. Megan threatens to call the police unless Ali and her family vacate the cottage within 24 hours, which they do and move in with Rachel.\n\nIn April 2015, Dan and Ali drive to Liverpool after discovering that Sean has been involved in a car accident with his friends. When they arrive back home, it is implied that Sean's injuries sustained during the crash are serious and Ali decides to stay in Liverpool until he recovers and Ruby stays in the village to ensure a steady income for the family. In August 2015, Ali returns to the village after Ruby is killed in the helicopter crash at Pete and Debbie's wedding. After Ruby's funeral, Ali discovers Rachel has been physically abusing her partner Sam. Ali asks Rachel to move to Liverpool with her as she can no longer stay in the village because of the memories of Ruby and so that Rachel can get help for her anger issues, both sisters leave Emmerdale on 26 August 2015.\n\nIn April 2018, Ali's former brother-in-law [[Daz Spencer]] received a call from Sean telling him that Ali had been killed in a car accident.

All species are [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|10|\u2013|40|m|ft|0|lk=in}} tall, with [[pinnate]] leaves {{convert|200|\u2013|900|mm|in}}, with 5\u201325 leaflets; the shoots have chambered [[pith]], a character shared with the [[wingnut (plant)|wingnuts]] (''Pterocarya''), but not the [[hickory|hickories]] (''Carya'') in the same family.\n\nThe 21 species in the genus range across the north temperate [[Old World]] from southeast [[Europe]] east to [[Japan]], and more widely in the [[New World]] from southeast [[Canada]] west to [[California]] and south to [[Argentina]]. China produces half of the world total of walnuts.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name ''walnut'' derives from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''wealhhnutu'', literally 'foreign nut' (from ''wealh'' 'foreign' + ''hnutu'' 'nut'),<ref>{{cite web|title=walnut|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=walnut|work=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref> because it was introduced from [[Gaul]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=walnut&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Etymonline.com|accessdate=2015-07-16}}</ref> The [[Latin]] name for the walnut was ''nux Gallica'', \"[[Gaul|Gallic]] nut\".\n\nThe generic name comes from Latin ''j\u016bglans'', meaning 'walnut, walnut tree'; ''j\u016bglans'' in turn is a contraction of ''J\u014dvis glans'', 'nut of [the god] Jupiter'.<ref>{{L&S|j\u016bglans|ref}}</ref><ref>{{L&S|glans|ref}} \"an acorn, and, in gen., any acorn-shaped fruit, beechnut, chestnut, etc.\"</ref>\n\n==Folklore==\nTradition has it that a walnut tree should be beaten.

Other major producers were the United States (15%) and [[Iran]] (9%).\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Baklava in Bodrum, Turkey (5653812987).jpg|thumb|Walnut is one of the main ingredients of [[Baklava]] and [[Turkish cuisine]].]]\nThe two most commercially important species are ''[[Juglans regia|J. regia]]'' for timber and nuts, and ''[[Juglans nigra|J. nigra]]'' for timber. Both species have similar cultivation requirements and are widely grown in temperate zones.\n\nWalnuts are light-demanding species that benefit from protection from wind. Walnuts are also very hardy against drought.\n\nInterplanting walnut plantations with a [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] plant, such as ''Elaeagnus \u00d7 ebbingei'' or ''[[Elaeagnus umbellata]]'', and various ''[[Alnus]]'' species, results in a 30% increase in tree height and girth (Hemery 2001).\n\nWhen grown for nuts, care must be taken to select [[cultivar]]s that are compatible for pollination purposes; although some cultivars are marketed as \"self fertile\", they will generally fruit better with a different pollination partner. Many different cultivars are available for growers, and offer different growth habits, flowering and leafing, kernel flavours and shell thicknesses.  A key trait for more northerly latitudes of North America and Europe is [[phenology]], with \u2018late flushing\u2019 being particularly important to avoid frost damage in spring.  Some cultivars have been developed for novel \u2018hedge\u2019 production systems developed in Europe and would not suit more traditional orchard systems.\n\n===Flowers===\nThe leaves and blossoms of the walnut tree normally appear in spring. The male cylindrical catkins are developed from leafless shoots from the past year; they are about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and have a large number of little flowers. Female flowers appear in a cluster at the peak of the current year\u2019s leafy shoots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fruitandnuttrees.com/walnut-tree-j-regia-j-nigra|title=Fruit and Nut Trees \u2013 Fruit Bearing Plants \" Blog Archive \" Walnut Tree - Juglans regia \u2013 Juglans nigra|publisher=Fruitandnuttrees.com|accessdate=2015-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430130505/http://fruitandnuttrees.com/walnut-tree-j-regia-j-nigra|archive-date=2009-04-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Fruit===\nThe fruits of the walnut are a type of [[accessory fruit]] known as a pseudodrupe (or drupe-like nut), the outer covering of the fruit is an [[involucral bract|involucre]] - in a drupe the covering would be derived from the carpel.<ref>{{Cite book|page=250|title=The Encyclopedia of Seeds: Science, Technology and Uses|author1=J.

In the UK, these are called [[pickled walnuts]] and this is one of the major uses for fresh nuts from the small scale plantings. In [[Armenian cuisine]], unripe walnuts, including husks, are preserved in sugar syrup and eaten whole. In Italy, [[liqueur]]s called [[Nocino]] and [[Nocello]] are flavoured with walnuts, while ''Salsa di Noci'' (walnut sauce) is a pasta sauce originating from [[Liguria]]. In [[Georgian cuisine|Georgia]], walnuts are ground with other ingredients to make [[walnut sauce]].\n\nWalnuts are heavily used in [[India]]. In [[Jammu]], it is used widely as a ''prasad'' (offering) to Mother Goddess Vaisnav [[Devi]] and, generally, as a dry food in the season of festivals such as [[Diwali]].\n\nThe nuts are rich in [[Walnut oil|oil]], and are widely eaten both fresh and in [[cookery]]. Walnut oil is expensive and consequently is used sparingly; most often in [[salad dressing]]s.  Walnut oil has been used in [[oil paint]], as an effective binding medium, known for its clear, glossy consistency and nontoxicity.\n\nManos and Stone studied the composition of seed oils from several species of the [[Rhoipteleaceae]] and [[Juglandaceae]] and found the nut oils were generally more unsaturated from species which grow in the [[Temperateness|temperate]] zones and more saturated for species which grow in the [[Tropics|tropical]] zones.<ref>Manos, Paul S. and Stone, Donald E.: \"Phylogeny and Systematics of the Juglandaceae\" ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' '''88'''(2)231\u2013269 Spring, 2001</ref>  In the northerly-growing section ''Trachycaryon'', ''J.&nbsp;cinerea'' oil was reported to contain 15% [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|linolenate]] (the report did not specify whether the linolenate was the alpha (n-3) or gamma (n-6) isomer, or perhaps a mixture), 2% of saturated [[palmitic acid|palmitate]], and a maximum concentration of 71% [[linoleic acid|linoleate]].  In the section ''Juglans'', ''J.&nbsp;regia'' nut oil was found to contain from 10% to 11% linolenate, 6% to 7% palmitate, and a maximum concentration of  linoleate (62% to 68%).  In the section ''Cardiocaryon'', the nut oils of ''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'' and ''J.&nbsp;mandshurica'' were reported to contain (respectively) 7% and 5% of linolenate, 2% of palmitate, and maximum concentrations of 74% and 79% linoleate.  Within the section ''Rhysocaryon'', the nut oils of the  U.S. native black walnuts ''J.&nbsp;microcarpa'' and ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' were reported to contain (respectively) 7% and 3% linolenate, 4% and 3% palmitate, and 70% and 69% linoleate.  The remaining results for black walnuts were: ''J.&nbsp;australis'' contained 2% linolenate, 7% palmitate, and 61% linoleate; ''J.&nbsp;boliviana'' contained 4% linolenate, 4% palmitate, and 70% linoleate; ''J.&nbsp;hirsuta'' contained 2% linolenate, 5% palmitate, and 75% linoleate; ''J.&nbsp;mollis'' contained 0% linolenate, 5% palmitate, 46% linoleate, and 49% [[oleic acid|oleate]]; ''J.&nbsp;neotropica'' contained 3% linolenate, 5% palmitate, and 50% linoleate; and  ''J.&nbsp;olanchana'' contained only a trace of linolenate, 9% palmitate, and 73% linoleate;\n\n====Shells====\n[[File:Walnuts.JPG|thumb|left|The shells of walnuts]]\n\nThe walnut shell has a wide variety of uses. Eastern black walnut (''J.&nbsp;nigra'') shell is the hardest of the walnut shells, and therefore has the highest resistance to breakdown. \n* Cleansing and polishing: Walnut shells are mostly used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This environmentally friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive is well suited for air blasting, deburring, descaling, and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In the early days of jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used to scour the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with air cooled vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.\n* Oil well drilling: The shell is used widely in oil well drilling for lost circulation material in making and maintaining seals in fracture zones and unconsolidated formations.\n* Flour made from walnut shells is widely used in the plastics industry.\n* Paint thickener: Walnut shells are added to paint to give it a thicker consistency for \"plaster effect\" ranges.\n* Explosives: Used as a filler in dynamite\n* Cosmetic cleaner: Occasionally used in soap and exfoliating cleansers\n\n====Husks====\n[[Image:Walnut hand stain.jpg|thumb|Staining from handling walnuts with [[husk]]s]]\n\nWalnut husks are often used to create a rich yellow-brown to dark brown [[dye]] used for dyeing [[textile|fabric]], yarn or [[wood]] and for other purposes.  The dye does not require a [[mordant]] and will readily stain the hand if picked without gloves.\n\n===Wood===\n[[File:Walnut pith.jpg|thumb|left|Walnut shoot cut longitudinally to show chambered [[pith]], scale in mm]]\n\nThe common walnut, and the black walnut and its allies, are important for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The color is dark chocolate or similar in the heartwood changing by a sharp boundary to creamy white in the sapwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown color, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its color, hardness and grain, it is a prized furniture and carving wood. Walnut [[burl]]s (or \"burrs\" in Europe) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. The grain figure exposed when a crotch (fork) in a walnut log is cut in the plane of its one entering branch and two exiting branches is attractive and sought after. [[Wood veneer|Veneer]] sliced from walnut burl is one of the most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries, including the [[Gewehr 98]] and [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles of the First World War. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks, and is generally considered to be the premium \u2013 as well as the most traditional \u2013 wood for gun stocks, due to its resilience to compression along the grain. Walnut is also used in [[Luthier|lutherie]] and for the body of [[pipe organ]]s. The wood of the [[butternut (tree)|butternut]] and related Asian species is of much lower value, softer, coarser, less strong and heavy, and paler in colour.\n\nFreshly sawed walnut heartwood may be greenish in color, but with exposure to air this color quickly changes to brown.\n\nIn North America, forestry research has been undertaken mostly on ''J.&nbsp;nigra'', aiming to improve the quality of planting stock and markets. In some areas of the US, black walnut is the most valuable commercial timber species.<ref name=ohioline>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708061425/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b700/b700_22.html ]</ref> The Walnut Council<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutcouncil.org|title=Walnut Council--Growing Walnut and Other Fine Hardwoods|publisher=Walnutcouncil.org|accessdate=2015-07-16}}</ref> is the key body linking growers with scientists.

(2002)</ref> Juglone is [[allelopathy|toxic to plants]] such as [[tomato]], [[apple]], and [[birch]], and may cause stunting and death of nearby vegetation.  Juglone appears to be one of the walnut's primary defence mechanisms against potential competitors for resources (water, nutrients and sunlight), and its effects are felt most strongly inside the tree's \"drip line\" (the circle around the tree marked by the horizontal distance of its outermost branches). However, even plants at a seemingly great distance outside the drip line can be affected, and juglone can linger in the soil for several years even after a walnut is removed as its roots slowly decompose and release juglone into the soil.\n\n===Walnut as wildlife food plants===\nWalnut species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species.

Walnuts are a traditional feature of [[Iranian cuisine]]; the nation has extensive orchards which are an important feature of regional economies. In [[Kyrgyzstan]] alone, there are 230,700 ha of walnut-fruit forest, where ''J.&nbsp;regia'' is the dominant overstory tree (Hemery and Popov 1998).  In non-European English-speaking nations, the nut of the ''J.&nbsp;regia'' is often called the \"English walnut\";  in Great Britain, the \"common walnut.\"\n\nThe [[Black Walnut|eastern black walnut]] (''J.&nbsp;nigra'') is a common species in its native eastern [[North America]], and is also widely cultivated elsewhere. The nuts are edible, and though they are often used in expensive baked goods, the Persian walnut is preferred for everyday use because it is easier to extract the nutmeat.  The wood is particularly valuable.\n\nThe [[Juglans hindsii|Hinds' black walnut]] (''J.&nbsp;hindsii'') is native to northern California, where it has been widely used commercially as a rootstock for ''J.&nbsp;regia'' trees.  Hinds' black walnut shells do not have the deep grooves characteristic of the eastern black walnut.\n\n[[File:Juglans ailantifolia.jpg|thumb|Japanese walnut foliage and nuts]]\nThe [[Japanese walnut]] (''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'') is similar to butternut, distinguished by the larger leaves up to 90&nbsp;cm long, and round (not oval) nuts. The variety ''cordiformis'', often called the '''heartnut''' has heart-shaped nuts; the common name of this variety is the source of the sectional name Cardiocaryon.\n\nThe [[Butternut (tree)|butternut]] (''J.&nbsp;cinerea'') is also native to eastern North America, where it is currently [[endangered species|endangered]] by an introduced disease, [[butternut canker]], caused by the [[fungus]] ''[[Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum]]''. Its leaves are 40\u201360&nbsp;cm long, the fruits are oval, the shell has very tall, very slender ridges, and the kernel is especially high in fat.\n\n====Hybrids====\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;bixbyi'' Rehd.\u2014''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'' x ''J.&nbsp;cinerea''\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;intermedia'' Carr.\u2014''J.&nbsp;nigra'' x ''J.&nbsp;regia''\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;notha'' Rehd.\u2014''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'' x ''J.&nbsp;regia''\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;quadrangulata'' (Carr.)

Other major producers were the United States (15%) and [[Iran]] (9%).\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Baklava in Bodrum, Turkey (5653812987).jpg|thumb|Walnut is one of the main ingredients of [[Baklava]] and [[Turkish cuisine]].]]\nThe two most commercially important species are ''[[Juglans regia|J. regia]]'' for timber and nuts, and ''[[Juglans nigra|J. nigra]]'' for timber. Both species have similar cultivation requirements and are widely grown in temperate zones.\n\nWalnuts are light-demanding species that benefit from protection from wind. Walnuts are also very hardy against drought.\n\nInterplanting walnut plantations with a [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] plant, such as ''Elaeagnus \u00d7 ebbingei'' or ''[[Elaeagnus umbellata]]'', and various ''[[Alnus]]'' species, results in a 30% increase in tree height and girth (Hemery 2001).\n\nWhen grown for nuts, care must be taken to select [[cultivar]]s that are compatible for pollination purposes; although some cultivars are marketed as \"self fertile\", they will generally fruit better with a different pollination partner. Many different cultivars are available for growers, and offer different growth habits, flowering and leafing, kernel flavours and shell thicknesses.  A key trait for more northerly latitudes of North America and Europe is [[phenology]], with \u2018late flushing\u2019 being particularly important to avoid frost damage in spring.  Some cultivars have been developed for novel \u2018hedge\u2019 production systems developed in Europe and would not suit more traditional orchard systems.\n\n===Flowers===\nThe leaves and blossoms of the walnut tree normally appear in spring. The male cylindrical catkins are developed from leafless shoots from the past year; they are about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and have a large number of little flowers. Female flowers appear in a cluster at the peak of the current year\u2019s leafy shoots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fruitandnuttrees.com/walnut-tree-j-regia-j-nigra|title=Fruit and Nut Trees \u2013 Fruit Bearing Plants \" Blog Archive \" Walnut Tree - Juglans regia \u2013 Juglans nigra|publisher=Fruitandnuttrees.com|accessdate=2015-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430130505/http://fruitandnuttrees.com/walnut-tree-j-regia-j-nigra|archive-date=2009-04-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Fruit===\nThe fruits of the walnut are a type of [[accessory fruit]] known as a pseudodrupe (or drupe-like nut), the outer covering of the fruit is an [[involucral bract|involucre]] - in a drupe the covering would be derived from the carpel.<ref>{{Cite book|page=250|title=The Encyclopedia of Seeds: Science, Technology and Uses|author1=J.

In the UK, these are called [[pickled walnuts]] and this is one of the major uses for fresh nuts from the small scale plantings. In [[Armenian cuisine]], unripe walnuts, including husks, are preserved in sugar syrup and eaten whole. In Italy, [[liqueur]]s called [[Nocino]] and [[Nocello]] are flavoured with walnuts, while ''Salsa di Noci'' (walnut sauce) is a pasta sauce originating from [[Liguria]]. In [[Georgian cuisine|Georgia]], walnuts are ground with other ingredients to make [[walnut sauce]].\n\nWalnuts are heavily used in [[India]]. In [[Jammu]], it is used widely as a ''prasad'' (offering) to Mother Goddess Vaisnav [[Devi]] and, generally, as a dry food in the season of festivals such as [[Diwali]].\n\nThe nuts are rich in [[Walnut oil|oil]], and are widely eaten both fresh and in [[cookery]]. Walnut oil is expensive and consequently is used sparingly; most often in [[salad dressing]]s.  Walnut oil has been used in [[oil paint]], as an effective binding medium, known for its clear, glossy consistency and nontoxicity.\n\nManos and Stone studied the composition of seed oils from several species of the [[Rhoipteleaceae]] and [[Juglandaceae]] and found the nut oils were generally more unsaturated from species which grow in the [[Temperateness|temperate]] zones and more saturated for species which grow in the [[Tropics|tropical]] zones.<ref>Manos, Paul S. and Stone, Donald E.: \"Phylogeny and Systematics of the Juglandaceae\" ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' '''88'''(2)231\u2013269 Spring, 2001</ref>  In the northerly-growing section ''Trachycaryon'', ''J.&nbsp;cinerea'' oil was reported to contain 15% [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|linolenate]] (the report did not specify whether the linolenate was the alpha (n-3) or gamma (n-6) isomer, or perhaps a mixture), 2% of saturated [[palmitic acid|palmitate]], and a maximum concentration of 71% [[linoleic acid|linoleate]].  In the section ''Juglans'', ''J.&nbsp;regia'' nut oil was found to contain from 10% to 11% linolenate, 6% to 7% palmitate, and a maximum concentration of  linoleate (62% to 68%).  In the section ''Cardiocaryon'', the nut oils of ''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'' and ''J.&nbsp;mandshurica'' were reported to contain (respectively) 7% and 5% of linolenate, 2% of palmitate, and maximum concentrations of 74% and 79% linoleate.  Within the section ''Rhysocaryon'', the nut oils of the  U.S. native black walnuts ''J.&nbsp;microcarpa'' and ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' were reported to contain (respectively) 7% and 3% linolenate, 4% and 3% palmitate, and 70% and 69% linoleate.  The remaining results for black walnuts were: ''J.&nbsp;australis'' contained 2% linolenate, 7% palmitate, and 61% linoleate; ''J.&nbsp;boliviana'' contained 4% linolenate, 4% palmitate, and 70% linoleate; ''J.&nbsp;hirsuta'' contained 2% linolenate, 5% palmitate, and 75% linoleate; ''J.&nbsp;mollis'' contained 0% linolenate, 5% palmitate, 46% linoleate, and 49% [[oleic acid|oleate]]; ''J.&nbsp;neotropica'' contained 3% linolenate, 5% palmitate, and 50% linoleate; and  ''J.&nbsp;olanchana'' contained only a trace of linolenate, 9% palmitate, and 73% linoleate;\n\n====Shells====\n[[File:Walnuts.JPG|thumb|left|The shells of walnuts]]\n\nThe walnut shell has a wide variety of uses. Eastern black walnut (''J.&nbsp;nigra'') shell is the hardest of the walnut shells, and therefore has the highest resistance to breakdown. \n* Cleansing and polishing: Walnut shells are mostly used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This environmentally friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive is well suited for air blasting, deburring, descaling, and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In the early days of jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used to scour the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with air cooled vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.\n* Oil well drilling: The shell is used widely in oil well drilling for lost circulation material in making and maintaining seals in fracture zones and unconsolidated formations.\n* Flour made from walnut shells is widely used in the plastics industry.\n* Paint thickener: Walnut shells are added to paint to give it a thicker consistency for \"plaster effect\" ranges.\n* Explosives: Used as a filler in dynamite\n* Cosmetic cleaner: Occasionally used in soap and exfoliating cleansers\n\n====Husks====\n[[Image:Walnut hand stain.jpg|thumb|Staining from handling walnuts with [[husk]]s]]\n\nWalnut husks are often used to create a rich yellow-brown to dark brown [[dye]] used for dyeing [[textile|fabric]], yarn or [[wood]] and for other purposes.  The dye does not require a [[mordant]] and will readily stain the hand if picked without gloves.\n\n===Wood===\n[[File:Walnut pith.jpg|thumb|left|Walnut shoot cut longitudinally to show chambered [[pith]], scale in mm]]\n\nThe common walnut, and the black walnut and its allies, are important for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The color is dark chocolate or similar in the heartwood changing by a sharp boundary to creamy white in the sapwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown color, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its color, hardness and grain, it is a prized furniture and carving wood. Walnut [[burl]]s (or \"burrs\" in Europe) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. The grain figure exposed when a crotch (fork) in a walnut log is cut in the plane of its one entering branch and two exiting branches is attractive and sought after. [[Wood veneer|Veneer]] sliced from walnut burl is one of the most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries, including the [[Gewehr 98]] and [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles of the First World War. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks, and is generally considered to be the premium \u2013 as well as the most traditional \u2013 wood for gun stocks, due to its resilience to compression along the grain. Walnut is also used in [[Luthier|lutherie]] and for the body of [[pipe organ]]s. The wood of the [[butternut]] and related Asian species is of much lower value, softer, coarser, less strong and heavy, and paler in colour.\n\nFreshly sawed walnut heartwood may be greenish in color, but with exposure to air this color quickly changes to brown.\n\nIn North America, forestry research has been undertaken mostly on ''J.&nbsp;nigra'', aiming to improve the quality of planting stock and markets. In some areas of the US, black walnut is the most valuable commercial timber species.<ref name=ohioline>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708061425/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b700/b700_22.html ]</ref> The Walnut Council<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutcouncil.org|title=Walnut Council--Growing Walnut and Other Fine Hardwoods|publisher=Walnutcouncil.org|accessdate=2015-07-16}}</ref> is the key body linking growers with scientists.

(2002)</ref> Juglone is [[allelopathy|toxic to plants]] such as [[tomato]], [[apple]], and [[birch]], and may cause stunting and death of nearby vegetation.  Juglone appears to be one of the walnut's primary defence mechanisms against potential competitors for resources (water, nutrients and sunlight), and its effects are felt most strongly inside the tree's \"drip line\" (the circle around the tree marked by the horizontal distance of its outermost branches). However, even plants at a seemingly great distance outside the drip line can be affected, and juglone can linger in the soil for several years even after a walnut is removed as its roots slowly decompose and release juglone into the soil.\n\n===Walnut as wildlife food plants===\nWalnut species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species.

Walnuts are a traditional feature of [[Iranian cuisine]]; the nation has extensive orchards which are an important feature of regional economies. In [[Kyrgyzstan]] alone, there are 230,700 ha of walnut-fruit forest, where ''J.&nbsp;regia'' is the dominant overstory tree (Hemery and Popov 1998).  In non-European English-speaking nations, the nut of the ''J.&nbsp;regia'' is often called the \"English walnut\";  in Great Britain, the \"common walnut.\"\n\nThe [[Black Walnut|eastern black walnut]] (''J.&nbsp;nigra'') is a common species in its native eastern [[North America]], and is also widely cultivated elsewhere. The nuts are edible, and though they are often used in expensive baked goods, the Persian walnut is preferred for everyday use because it is easier to extract the nutmeat.  The wood is particularly valuable.\n\nThe [[Juglans hindsii|Hinds' black walnut]] (''J.&nbsp;hindsii'') is native to northern California, where it has been widely used commercially as a rootstock for ''J.&nbsp;regia'' trees.  Hinds' black walnut shells do not have the deep grooves characteristic of the eastern black walnut.\n\n[[File:Juglans ailantifolia.jpg|thumb|Japanese walnut foliage and nuts]]\nThe [[Japanese walnut]] (''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'') is similar to butternut, distinguished by the larger leaves up to 90&nbsp;cm long, and round (not oval) nuts. The variety ''cordiformis'', often called the '''heartnut''' has heart-shaped nuts; the common name of this variety is the source of the sectional name Cardiocaryon.\n\nThe [[Butternut (tree)|butternut]] (''J.&nbsp;cinerea'') is also native to eastern North America, where it is currently [[endangered species|endangered]] by an introduced disease, [[butternut canker]], caused by the [[fungus]] ''[[Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum]]''. Its leaves are 40\u201360&nbsp;cm long, the fruits are oval, the shell has very tall, very slender ridges, and the kernel is especially high in fat.\n\n====Hybrids====\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;bixbyi'' Rehd.\u2014''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'' x ''J.&nbsp;cinerea''\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;intermedia'' Carr.\u2014''J.&nbsp;nigra'' x ''J.&nbsp;regia''\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;notha'' Rehd.\u2014''J.&nbsp;ailantifolia'' x ''J.&nbsp;regia''\n*''J.&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;quadrangulata'' (Carr.)
