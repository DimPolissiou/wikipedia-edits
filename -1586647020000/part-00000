The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

[[Australian Capital Territory]] and surrounding [[New South Wales]] towns [[Queanbeyan]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]. The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]].\n\nBerger and Luckmann introduced the term \"[[social construction]]\" into the [[social sciences]] and were strongly influenced by the work of [[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]]. Their central concept is that people and groups interacting in a social system create, over time, concepts or mental representations of each other's actions, and that these concepts eventually become habituated into reciprocal roles played by the actors in relation to each other. When these roles are made available to other members of society to enter into and play out, the reciprocal interactions are said to be [[institutionalization|institutionalized]]. In the process, meaning is embedded in society. Knowledge and people's conceptions (and beliefs) of what reality is become embedded in the institutional fabric of society. Reality is therefore said to be socially constructed.\n\nIn 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] listed ''The Social Construction of Reality'' as the fifth-most important sociological book of the 20th century.<ref name=\"isa-sociology\">{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/ |title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n=== Social stock of knowledge ===\nEarlier theories (those of, for example, [[Max Scheler]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Werner Stark]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Max Weber]]) often paid too much attention to scientific and theoretical knowledge, but this is only a small part of social knowledge, concerning a very limited group. Customs, common interpretations, institutions, shared routines, habitualizations, the who-is-who and who-does-what in social processes and the division of labor, constitute a much larger part of knowledge in society.\n<blockquote>\n\u201c\u2026theoretical knowledge is only a small and by no means the most important part of what passed for knowledge in a society\u2026 the primary knowledge about the institutional order is knowledge\u2026 is the sum total of \u2018what everybody knows\u2019 about a social world, an assemblage of maxims, morals, proverbial nuggets of wisdom, values and beliefs, myths, and so forth\u201d (p.65)\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:BergerLuckmann underlyingFramework.jpg|350px|center]]\n\n=== Semantic fields ===\nThe general body of knowledge is socially distributed, and classified in semantic fields. The dynamic distribution and inter dependencies of these knowledge sectors provide structure to the social stock of knowledge: \n<blockquote>\n\u201cThe social stock of knowledge differentiates reality by degrees of familiarity\u2026 my knowledge of my own occupation and its world is very rich and specific, while I have only very sketchy knowledge of the occupational worlds of others\u201d (p.43) \u201cThe social distribution of knowledge thus begins with the simple fact that I do not know everything known to my fellowmen, and vice versa, and culminates in exceedingly complex and esoteric systems of expertise. Knowledge of how the socially available stock of knowledge is distributed, at least in outline, is an important element of that same stock of knowledge.\u201d (p.46)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Language and signs ===\nLanguage also plays an important role in the analysis of integration of everyday reality. Language links up commonsense knowledge with finite provinces of meaning, thus enabling people, for example, to interpret dreams through understandings relevant in the daytime. \"Language is capable of transcending the reality of everyday life altogether. It can refer to experiences pertaining to finite provinces of meaning, it can span discrete spheres of reality...Language soars into regions that are not only de facto but also a priori unavailable to everyday experience.\"p.&nbsp;40. Regarding the function of language and signs, Berger and Luckmann are indebted to George Herbert Mead and other figures in the field known as [[symbolic interactionism]], as acknowledged in their Introduction, especially regarding the possibility of constructing objectivity.\n\nSigns and language provide interoperability for the construction of everyday reality: \n<blockquote>\n\u201cA sign [has the] explicit intention to serve as an index of subjective meanings \u2026 Language is capable of becoming the objective repository of vast accumulations of meaning and experience, which it can then preserve in time and transmit to following generations\u2026 Language also typifies experiences, allowing me to subsume them under broad categories in terms of which they have meaning not only to myself but also to my fellowmen\u201d (p.35-39)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Social everyday reality ===\nSocial everyday reality is characterized by [[Intersubjectivity]] (which refers to the coexistence of multiple realities in this context)(p.&nbsp;23-25): \n<blockquote>\n\u201cCompared to the reality of everyday life, other realities appear as finite provinces of meaning, enclaves within the paramount reality marked by circumscribed meanings and modes of experience\u201d (p.25)\n</blockquote>\nThis is in contrast to other realities, such as dreams, theoretical constructs, religious or mystic beliefs, artistic and imaginary worlds, etc. While individuals may visit other realities (such as watching a film), they are always brought back to everyday reality (once the film ends)(p. 25).\n\nIndividuals have the capacity to reflect on these realities, including their own social everyday reality. This type of reflection is often referred to as [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]. But, crucially, even reflexivity must draw on some \"source material\" or be rooted in intersubjectivity. It has, thus, been suggested that: \"As agents exercise their reflexive capacities, they bring with them a past consisting of social experiences accumulated or sedimented into stocks of knowledge that provide the requisite guidance for going about their lives and interpreting their social reality\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elster|first=Julius|date=2017|title=The temporal dimension of reflexivity: linking reflexive orientations to the stock of knowledge|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1600910X.2017.1397527|journal=Distinktion: Journal of Social Theory|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=274\u2013293|doi=10.1080/1600910X.2017.1397527|issn=1600-910X|via=}}</ref> \n\n== Society as objective reality ==\n\n{{Cquote | Social order is a human product, or more precisely, an ongoing human production | (p.52).}}\n\n=== Institutionalization ===\nInstitutionalization of social processes grows out of the habitualization and customs, gained through mutual observation with subsequent mutual agreement on the \u201cway of doing things\u201d. This reduces uncertainty and danger and allows our limited attention span to focus on more things at the same time, while institutionalized routines can be expected to continue \u201cas previously agreed\u201d:\n<blockquote>\n\u201cHabitualization carries with it the important psychological gain that choices are narrowed\u2026 the background of habitualized activity opens up a foreground for deliberation and innovation [which demand a higher level of attention]\u2026 The most important gain is that each [member of society] will be able to predict the other\u2019s actions. Concomitantly, the interaction of both becomes predictable\u2026 Many actions are possible on a low level of attention. Each action of one is no longer a source of astonishment and potential danger to the other\u201c (p.53-57).\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Social objective worlds ===\nSocial (or institutional) objective worlds are one consequence of institutionalization, and are created when institutions are passed on to a new generation. This creates a reality that is vulnerable to the ideas of a minority which will then form the basis of social expectations in the future. The underlying reasoning is fully transparent to the creators of an institution, as they can reconstruct the circumstances under which they made agreements; while the second generation inherits it as something \u201cgiven\u201d, \u201cunalterable\u201d and \u201cself-evident\u201d and they might not understand the underlying logic. \n<blockquote>\n\u201c\u2026a social world [is] a comprehensive and given reality confronting the individual in a manner analogous to the reality of the natural world\u2026 In early phases of socialization the child is quite incapable of distinguishing between the objectivity of natural phenomena and the objectivity of the social formations\u2026 The objective reality of institutions is not diminished if the individual does not understand their purpose or their mode of operation\u2026 He must \u2018go out\u2019 and learn about them, just as he must learn about nature\u2026 (p.59-61)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nDivision of labor is another consequence of institutionalization. Institutions assign \u201croles\u201d to be performed by various actors, through typification of performances, such as \u201cfather-role\u201d, \u201cteacher-role\u201d, \u201chunter\u201d, \u201ccook\u201d, etc. As specialization increases in number as well as in size and sophistication, a civilization's culture contains more and more sections of knowledge specific to given roles or tasks, sections which become more and more esoteric to non-specialists. These areas of knowledge do not belong anymore to the ''common'' social world and culture.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cA society\u2019s stock of knowledge is structured in terms of what is generally relevant and what is relevant only to specific roles\u2026 the social distribution of knowledge entails a dichotomization in terms of general and role-specific relevance\u2026 because of the division of labor, role-specific knowledge will grow at a faster rate than generally relevant and accessible knowledge\u2026 The increasing number and complexity of [the resulting] sub universes [of specialized knowledge] make them increasingly inaccessible to outsiders (p.77-87)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Symbolic universes ===\nSymbolic universes are created to provide legitimation to the created institutional structure. Symbolic universes are a set of beliefs \u201ceverybody knows\u201d that aim at making the institutionalized structure plausible and acceptable for the individual\u2014who might otherwise not understand or agree with the underlying logic of the institution. As an ideological system, the symbolic universe \u201cputs everything in its right place\u201d. It provides explanations for why we do things the way we do. Proverbs, moral maxims, wise sayings, mythology, religions and other theological thought, metaphysical traditions and other value systems are part of the symbolic universe. They are all (more or less sophisticated) ways to legitimize established institutions.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cThe function of legitimation is to make objectively available and subjectively plausible the \u2018first-order\u2019 objections that have been institutionalized\u2026 Proverbs, moral maxims and wise sayings are common on this level\u2026 [as well as] explicit theories\u2026 symbolic processes\u2026 a general theory of the cosmos and a general theory of man\u2026 The symbolic universe also orders history. It locates all collective events in a cohesive unity that includes past, present and future.\u201d (p. 92-104)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Universe-maintenance ===\nUniverse-maintenance refers to specific procedures undertaken, often by an elite group, when the symbolic universe does not fulfill its purpose anymore, which is to legitimize the institutional structure in place. This happens, for example, in generational shifts, or when deviants create an internal movement against established institutions (e.g. against revolutions), or when a society is confronted with another society with a greatly different history and institutional structures. In primitive societies this happened through mythological systems, later on through theological thought. Today, an extremely complex set of science has secularized universe-maintenance.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cSpecific procedures of universe-maintenance become necessary when the symbolic universe has become a problem. As long as this is not the case, the symbolic universe is self-maintaining, that is self-legitimating. An intrinsic problem presents itself with the process of transmission of the symbolic universe from one generation to another\u2026 [additionally] two societies confronting each other with conflicting universes will both develop conceptual machinery designed to maintain their respective universes\u2026 mythology represents the most archaic form of universe-maintenance\u2026 theological thought may be distinguished from its mythological predecessor simply in terms of its greater degree of theoretical systematization\u2026 Modern science is an extreme step in this development. (p.104-116)\n</blockquote>\n\n== Society as subjective reality ==\n\n=== Socialization ===\nSocialization is a two-step induction of the individual to participate in the social institutional structure, meaning in its objective reality.\n \n<blockquote>\n\"The individual\u2026 is not born a member of society. He\u2026 becomes a member of society. In the life of every individual\u2026 there is a temporal sequence, in the course of which he is inducted into participation in the social dialectic\" (p. 149)  \u201cBy \u2018successful socialization\u2019 we mean the establishment of a high degree of symmetry between objective and subjective reality\u201d (p. 163)\n</blockquote>\n\n''Primary Socialization'' takes place as a child. It is highly charged emotionally and is not questioned. ''Secondary Socialization'' includes the acquisition of role-specific knowledge, thus taking one's place in the social division of labor. It is learned through training and specific rituals, and is not emotionally charged: \u201cit is necessary to love one\u2019s mother, but not one\u2019s teacher\u201d. Training for secondary socialization can be very complex and depends on the complexity of division of labor in a society. Primary socialization is much less flexible than secondary socialization. E.g. shame for nudity comes from primary socialization, adequate dress code depends on secondary: ''A relatively minor shift in the subjective definition of reality would suffice for an individual to take for granted that one may go to the office without a tie. A much more drastic shift would be necessary to have him go, as a matter of course, without any clothes at all''.\n<blockquote>\n\n\u201cThe child does not internalize the world of his significant others as one of many possible worlds\u2026 It is for this reason that the world internalized in primary socialization is so much more firmly entrenched in consciousness than worlds internalized in secondary socialization\u2026. Secondary socialization is the internalization of institutional or institution-based \u2018sub worlds\u2019\u2026 The roles of secondary socialization carry a high degree of anonymity\u2026 The same knowledge taught by one teacher could also be taught by another\u2026 The institutional distribution of tasks between primary and secondary socialization varies with the complexity of the social distribution of knowledge\u201d (p. 129-147)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Conversation ===\nConversation or verbal communication aims at reality-maintenance of the subjective reality. What seems to be a useless and unnecessary communication of redundant banalities is actually a constant mutual reconfirmation of each other's internal thoughts, in that it maintains subjective reality.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cOne may view the individual\u2019s everyday life in terms of the working away of a conversational apparatus that ongoingly maintains, modifies and reconstructs his subjective reality\u2026 [for example] \u2018Well, it\u2019s time for me to get to the station,\u2019 and \u2018Fine, darling, have a good day at the office\u2019 implies an entire world within which these apparently simple propositions make sense\u2026 the exchange confirms the subjective reality of this world\u2026 the great part, if not all, of everyday conversation maintains subjective reality\u2026 imagine the effect\u2026of an exchange like this: \u2018Well, it\u2019s time for me to get to the station,\u2019 \u2018Fine, darling, don\u2019t forget to take along your gun.\u2019 (p. 147-163)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Identity ===\nIdentity of an individual is subject to a struggle of affiliation to sometimes conflicting realities. For example, the reality from primary socialization (mother tells child not to steal) can be in contrast with second socialization (gang members teach teenager that stealing is cool). Our final social location in the institutional structure of society will ultimately also influence our body and organism.\n<blockquote>\n\u201c\u2026life-expectancies of lower-class and upper-class [vary] \u2026society determines how long and in what manner the individual organism shall live\u2026 Society also directly penetrates the organism in its functioning, most importantly in respect to sexuality and nutrition. While both sexuality and nutrition are grounded in biological drives\u2026 biological constitution does not tell him where he should seek sexual release and what he should eat.\u201d (p. 163-183)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\nThe philosopher Helmut R.

Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]].\n\nBerger and Luckmann introduced the term \"[[social construction]]\" into the [[social sciences]] and were strongly influenced by the work of [[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]]. Their central concept is that people and groups interacting in a social system create, over time, concepts or mental representations of each other's actions, and that these concepts eventually become habituated into reciprocal roles played by the actors in relation to each other. When these roles are made available to other members of society to enter into and play out, the reciprocal interactions are said to be [[institutionalization|institutionalized]]. In the process, meaning is embedded in society. Knowledge and people's conceptions (and beliefs) of what reality is become embedded in the institutional fabric of society. Reality is therefore said to be socially constructed.\n\nIn 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] listed ''The Social Construction of Reality'' as the fifth-most important sociological book of the 20th century.<ref name=\"isa-sociology\">{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/ |title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n=== Social stock of knowledge ===\nEarlier theories (those of, for example, [[Max Scheler]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Werner Stark]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Max Weber]]) often paid too much attention to scientific and theoretical knowledge, but this is only a small part of social knowledge, concerning a very limited group. Customs, common interpretations, institutions, shared routines, habitualizations, the who-is-who and who-does-what in social processes and the division of labor, constitute a much larger part of knowledge in society.\n<blockquote>\n\u201c\u2026theoretical knowledge is only a small and by no means the most important part of what passed for knowledge in a society\u2026 the primary knowledge about the institutional order is knowledge\u2026 is the sum total of \u2018what everybody knows\u2019 about a social world, an assemblage of maxims, morals, proverbial nuggets of wisdom, values and beliefs, myths, and so forth\u201d (p.65)\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:BergerLuckmann underlyingFramework.jpg|350px|center]]\n\n=== Semantic fields ===\nThe general body of knowledge is socially distributed, and classified in semantic fields. The dynamic distribution and inter dependencies of these knowledge sectors provide structure to the social stock of knowledge: \n<blockquote>\n\u201cThe social stock of knowledge differentiates reality by degrees of familiarity\u2026 my knowledge of my own occupation and its world is very rich and specific, while I have only very sketchy knowledge of the occupational worlds of others\u201d (p.43) \u201cThe social distribution of knowledge thus begins with the simple fact that I do not know everything known to my fellowmen, and vice versa, and culminates in exceedingly complex and esoteric systems of expertise. Knowledge of how the socially available stock of knowledge is distributed, at least in outline, is an important element of that same stock of knowledge.\u201d (p.46)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Language and signs ===\nLanguage also plays an important role in the analysis of integration of everyday reality. Language links up commonsense knowledge with finite provinces of meaning, thus enabling people, for example, to interpret dreams through understandings relevant in the daytime. \"Language is capable of transcending the reality of everyday life altogether. It can refer to experiences pertaining to finite provinces of meaning, it can span discrete spheres of reality...Language soars into regions that are not only de facto but also a priori unavailable to everyday experience.\"p.&nbsp;40. Regarding the function of language and signs, Berger and Luckmann are indebted to George Herbert Mead and other figures in the field known as [[symbolic interactionism]], as acknowledged in their Introduction, especially regarding the possibility of constructing objectivity.\n\nSigns and language provide interoperability for the construction of everyday reality: \n<blockquote>\n\u201cA sign [has the] explicit intention to serve as an index of subjective meanings \u2026 Language is capable of becoming the objective repository of vast accumulations of meaning and experience, which it can then preserve in time and transmit to following generations\u2026 Language also typifies experiences, allowing me to subsume them under broad categories in terms of which they have meaning not only to myself but also to my fellowmen\u201d (p.35-39)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Social everyday reality ===\nSocial everyday reality is characterized by [[Intersubjectivity]] (which refers to the coexistence of multiple realities in this context)(p.&nbsp;23-25): \n<blockquote>\n\u201cCompared to the reality of everyday life, other realities appear as finite provinces of meaning, enclaves within the paramount reality marked by circumscribed meanings and modes of experience\u201d (p.25)\n</blockquote>\nThis is in contrast to other realities, such as dreams, theoretical constructs, religious or mystic beliefs, artistic and imaginary worlds, etc. While individuals may visit other realities (such as watching a film), they are always brought back to everyday reality (once the film ends)(p. 25).\n\n== Society as objective reality ==\n\n{{Cquote | Social order is a human product, or more precisely, an ongoing human production | (p.52).}}\n\n=== Institutionalization ===\nInstitutionalization of social processes grows out of the habitualization and customs, gained through mutual observation with subsequent mutual agreement on the \u201cway of doing things\u201d. This reduces uncertainty and danger and allows our limited attention span to focus on more things at the same time, while institutionalized routines can be expected to continue \u201cas previously agreed\u201d:\n<blockquote>\n\u201cHabitualization carries with it the important psychological gain that choices are narrowed\u2026 the background of habitualized activity opens up a foreground for deliberation and innovation [which demand a higher level of attention]\u2026 The most important gain is that each [member of society] will be able to predict the other\u2019s actions. Concomitantly, the interaction of both becomes predictable\u2026 Many actions are possible on a low level of attention. Each action of one is no longer a source of astonishment and potential danger to the other\u201c (p.53-57).\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Social objective worlds ===\nSocial (or institutional) objective worlds are one consequence of institutionalization, and are created when institutions are passed on to a new generation. This creates a reality that is vulnerable to the ideas of a minority which will then form the basis of social expectations in the future. The underlying reasoning is fully transparent to the creators of an institution, as they can reconstruct the circumstances under which they made agreements; while the second generation inherits it as something \u201cgiven\u201d, \u201cunalterable\u201d and \u201cself-evident\u201d and they might not understand the underlying logic. \n<blockquote>\n\u201c\u2026a social world [is] a comprehensive and given reality confronting the individual in a manner analogous to the reality of the natural world\u2026 In early phases of socialization the child is quite incapable of distinguishing between the objectivity of natural phenomena and the objectivity of the social formations\u2026 The objective reality of institutions is not diminished if the individual does not understand their purpose or their mode of operation\u2026 He must \u2018go out\u2019 and learn about them, just as he must learn about nature\u2026 (p.59-61)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nDivision of labor is another consequence of institutionalization. Institutions assign \u201croles\u201d to be performed by various actors, through typification of performances, such as \u201cfather-role\u201d, \u201cteacher-role\u201d, \u201chunter\u201d, \u201ccook\u201d, etc. As specialization increases in number as well as in size and sophistication, a civilization's culture contains more and more sections of knowledge specific to given roles or tasks, sections which become more and more esoteric to non-specialists. These areas of knowledge do not belong anymore to the ''common'' social world and culture.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cA society\u2019s stock of knowledge is structured in terms of what is generally relevant and what is relevant only to specific roles\u2026 the social distribution of knowledge entails a dichotomization in terms of general and role-specific relevance\u2026 because of the division of labor, role-specific knowledge will grow at a faster rate than generally relevant and accessible knowledge\u2026 The increasing number and complexity of [the resulting] sub universes [of specialized knowledge] make them increasingly inaccessible to outsiders (p.77-87)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Symbolic universes ===\nSymbolic universes are created to provide legitimation to the created institutional structure. Symbolic universes are a set of beliefs \u201ceverybody knows\u201d that aim at making the institutionalized structure plausible and acceptable for the individual\u2014who might otherwise not understand or agree with the underlying logic of the institution. As an ideological system, the symbolic universe \u201cputs everything in its right place\u201d. It provides explanations for why we do things the way we do. Proverbs, moral maxims, wise sayings, mythology, religions and other theological thought, metaphysical traditions and other value systems are part of the symbolic universe. They are all (more or less sophisticated) ways to legitimize established institutions.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cThe function of legitimation is to make objectively available and subjectively plausible the \u2018first-order\u2019 objections that have been institutionalized\u2026 Proverbs, moral maxims and wise sayings are common on this level\u2026 [as well as] explicit theories\u2026 symbolic processes\u2026 a general theory of the cosmos and a general theory of man\u2026 The symbolic universe also orders history. It locates all collective events in a cohesive unity that includes past, present and future.\u201d (p. 92-104)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Universe-maintenance ===\nUniverse-maintenance refers to specific procedures undertaken, often by an elite group, when the symbolic universe does not fulfill its purpose anymore, which is to legitimize the institutional structure in place. This happens, for example, in generational shifts, or when deviants create an internal movement against established institutions (e.g. against revolutions), or when a society is confronted with another society with a greatly different history and institutional structures. In primitive societies this happened through mythological systems, later on through theological thought. Today, an extremely complex set of science has secularized universe-maintenance.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cSpecific procedures of universe-maintenance become necessary when the symbolic universe has become a problem. As long as this is not the case, the symbolic universe is self-maintaining, that is self-legitimating. An intrinsic problem presents itself with the process of transmission of the symbolic universe from one generation to another\u2026 [additionally] two societies confronting each other with conflicting universes will both develop conceptual machinery designed to maintain their respective universes\u2026 mythology represents the most archaic form of universe-maintenance\u2026 theological thought may be distinguished from its mythological predecessor simply in terms of its greater degree of theoretical systematization\u2026 Modern science is an extreme step in this development. (p.104-116)\n</blockquote>\n\n== Society as subjective reality ==\n\n=== Socialization ===\nSocialization is a two-step induction of the individual to participate in the social institutional structure, meaning in its objective reality.\n \n<blockquote>\n\"The individual\u2026 is not born a member of society. He\u2026 becomes a member of society. In the life of every individual\u2026 there is a temporal sequence, in the course of which he is inducted into participation in the social dialectic\" (p. 149)  \u201cBy \u2018successful socialization\u2019 we mean the establishment of a high degree of symmetry between objective and subjective reality\u201d (p. 163)\n</blockquote>\n\n''Primary Socialization'' takes place as a child. It is highly charged emotionally and is not questioned. ''Secondary Socialization'' includes the acquisition of role-specific knowledge, thus taking one's place in the social division of labor. It is learned through training and specific rituals, and is not emotionally charged: \u201cit is necessary to love one\u2019s mother, but not one\u2019s teacher\u201d. Training for secondary socialization can be very complex and depends on the complexity of division of labor in a society. Primary socialization is much less flexible than secondary socialization. E.g. shame for nudity comes from primary socialization, adequate dress code depends on secondary: ''A relatively minor shift in the subjective definition of reality would suffice for an individual to take for granted that one may go to the office without a tie. A much more drastic shift would be necessary to have him go, as a matter of course, without any clothes at all''.\n<blockquote>\n\n\u201cThe child does not internalize the world of his significant others as one of many possible worlds\u2026 It is for this reason that the world internalized in primary socialization is so much more firmly entrenched in consciousness than worlds internalized in secondary socialization\u2026. Secondary socialization is the internalization of institutional or institution-based \u2018sub worlds\u2019\u2026 The roles of secondary socialization carry a high degree of anonymity\u2026 The same knowledge taught by one teacher could also be taught by another\u2026 The institutional distribution of tasks between primary and secondary socialization varies with the complexity of the social distribution of knowledge\u201d (p. 129-147)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Conversation ===\nConversation or verbal communication aims at reality-maintenance of the subjective reality. What seems to be a useless and unnecessary communication of redundant banalities is actually a constant mutual reconfirmation of each other's internal thoughts, in that it maintains subjective reality.\n<blockquote>\n\u201cOne may view the individual\u2019s everyday life in terms of the working away of a conversational apparatus that ongoingly maintains, modifies and reconstructs his subjective reality\u2026 [for example] \u2018Well, it\u2019s time for me to get to the station,\u2019 and \u2018Fine, darling, have a good day at the office\u2019 implies an entire world within which these apparently simple propositions make sense\u2026 the exchange confirms the subjective reality of this world\u2026 the great part, if not all, of everyday conversation maintains subjective reality\u2026 imagine the effect\u2026of an exchange like this: \u2018Well, it\u2019s time for me to get to the station,\u2019 \u2018Fine, darling, don\u2019t forget to take along your gun.\u2019 (p. 147-163)\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Identity ===\nIdentity of an individual is subject to a struggle of affiliation to sometimes conflicting realities. For example, the reality from primary socialization (mother tells child not to steal) can be in contrast with second socialization (gang members teach teenager that stealing is cool). Our final social location in the institutional structure of society will ultimately also influence our body and organism.\n<blockquote>\n\u201c\u2026life-expectancies of lower-class and upper-class [vary] \u2026society determines how long and in what manner the individual organism shall live\u2026 Society also directly penetrates the organism in its functioning, most importantly in respect to sexuality and nutrition. While both sexuality and nutrition are grounded in biological drives\u2026 biological constitution does not tell him where he should seek sexual release and what he should eat.\u201d (p. 163-183)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\nThe philosopher Helmut R. Wagner called the book \"excellent and well-written\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Wagner, Helmut R. |title=Phenomenology of Consciousness and Sociology of the Life-world: An Introductory Study |publisher=The University of Alberta Press |location=Edmonton |year=1983 |page=147 |isbn=0-88864-032-3}}</ref> In 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] listed it as the fifth-most important sociological book of the 20th century, behind [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) but ahead of [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''[[Distinction (book)|Distinction]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"isa-sociology\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dramaturgy (sociology)]]\n* [[Reality tunnel]]\n* [[Social constructionism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Berger, P.

The Greeks were later assisted by the [[Russian Empire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration|Kingdom of France]], while the Ottomans were aided by their North African vassals, particularly the [[eyalet]] of [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. The war led to the formation of [[modern Greece]]. The revolution is celebrated in [[Greece]] and by Greeks around the world as [[Greek Independence Day|independence day]] on 25 March.\n\n[[Greece]] came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century, in the decades before and after the [[fall of Constantinople]].<ref>{{cite book|first =Caroline |last=Finkel|title =Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire|isbn = 9780465008506|date = 2007|publisher = Basic Books |page = 17|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9cTHyUQoTyUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA17}}</ref> During the following centuries, there were sporadic but unsuccessful [[Ottoman Greece#Uprisings before 1821|Greek uprisings]] against Ottoman rule.<ref>Woodhouse, ''A Story of Modern Greece'', 'The Dark Age of Greece (1453\u20131800)', p. 113, Faber and Faber (1968)</ref> In 1814, a secret organization called [[Filiki Eteria]] (Society of Friends) was founded with the aim of liberating Greece, encouraged by the revolutionary fervor gripping Europe in that period. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]], and [[Constantinople]] itself. The insurrection was planned for 25 March 1821 (on the Julian Calendar), the Orthodox Christian [[Feast of the Annunciation]]. However, the plans of Filiki Eteria were discovered by the Ottoman authorities, forcing the revolution to start earlier. The first revolt began on 6 March/21 February 1821 in the [[Danubian Principalities]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese ([[Morea]]) into action and on 17 March 1821, the [[Maniots]] were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks under the leadership of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. Revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and [[Central Greece]] broke out, but were eventually suppressed. Meanwhile, makeshift Greek fleets achieved success against the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.\n\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] called in his vassal [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. The town of [[Missolonghi]] fell in April 1826 after a [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|year-long siege]] by the Turks. Despite a [[Ottoman\u2013Egyptian invasion of Mani|failed invasion of Mani]], Athens also fell and the revolution looked all but lost.\n\nAt that point, the three Great Powers\u2014Russia, Britain and France\u2014decided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. Following news that the combined Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet was going to attack the island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied European fleets intercepted the Ottoman navy at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. After a tense week-long standoff, the [[Battle of Navarino]] led to the destruction of the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet and turned the tide in favor of the revolutionaries. In 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]]. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered, and the Greek revolutionaries proceeded to retake central Greece. Russia invaded the Ottoman Empire and forced it to accept Greek autonomy in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)]]. After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent state under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]] and the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]]; these defined the final borders of the new state and established [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto]] of Bavaria as the first king of Greece.\n\n==Background==\n{{Details|Background of the Greek War of Independence}}\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{See also|Ottoman Greece}}\nThe [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29&nbsp;May 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the [[Byzantine Empire]] marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty.

[[Peter the Great]] had envisaged a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the re-institution of a new Byzantine Empire with an Orthodox emperor. His [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1711 set a precedent for the Greeks, when Peter appealed to Orthodox Christians to join the Russians and rise against the Turks to fight for \"''faith and homeland''\".  The Russo-Turkish wars of Catherine II (1762-1796) made the Greeks  consider their emancipation with the aid of Russia. An independence movement in Peloponnesus (Morea) was incited by Russian agents in 1769, and a Greek flotilla under Lambros Katsonis assisted the Russian fleet in the war of 1788\u20131792.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwbHCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Lucien J.

Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment, and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent the remainder of his life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it. He spent a lot of his time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais' ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles but he died before the end of the revolution.\n\nThe connection of the Greek Revolution with the Enlightenment and the French Revolution has been questioned by several Greek authors, who considered this theory mechanistic and false.<ref>[http://antifono.gr/portal/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE/%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82-%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82/4775-%CF%84%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%87%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF-21-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B8%CE%BF%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AC.html Diamantis Apostolos, \"Schemes for the explanation of 21\". 24 March 2014, antifono.gr, in greek language.

Most of the members of the Peloponnesian Senate were local notables (lay and ecclesiastical) or persons controlled by them.\n\nThe three major social groups that provided the leadership of the revolution were the primates (wealthy landowners who controlled about a third of the arable land in the Peloponnese), the captains drawn from the ''klephts'' and/or ''armatolos'' (''klepts'' and ''armatolos'' tended to alternate), and the wealthy merchants, who were the most Westernised elements in Greek society.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 126-127</ref> One of the more prominent leaders of the merchants and a \"Westerniser\" was the Phanariot [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] who was living with the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and his wife [[Mary Shelley]] in Pisa when the revolution began, and upon hearing of the revolution, purchased supplies and a ship in Marseilles and then set sail for Greece.<ref name=\"Brewer, David page 127\">Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 127.</ref> Mavrokordhatos's wealth, education (he was fluent in seven languages) and his experience as an Ottoman official ruling Wallachia led many to look towards him as a leader.<ref name=\"Brewer, David page 127\"/>\n\nWhen [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] arrived in Peloponnese as official representative of Filiki Eteria, he tried to assume control of the Revolution's affairs, and he thus proposed a new system of electing the members of the Senate, which was supported by the military leaders, but opposed by the notables.{{cref|vi}} Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] in the western part, and [[Theodoros Negris]] in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two [[Greek local statutes|local statutes]], the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece, drafted mainly by Mavrokordatos and Negris respectively.

On 9&nbsp;August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans captured the fort at [[Gramvousa]] and other insurgents captured the fort at [[Kissamos]], and attempted to spread the insurgency further afield.<ref>Detorakis, ''Turkish rule in Crete'', p. 381</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ottomans did not manage to retake the forts, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the island's western provinces.

Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish\u2013Egyptian and European shipping in the region.

The ideals and patriotic songs of Rigas Feraios and others had made a profound impression upon the Thessalonians. \u0391 few years later, the revolutionary fervour of the southern Greeks was to spread to these parts, and the seeds of Filiki Eteria were speedily to take root. The leader and coordinator of the revolution in Macedonia was [[Emmanouel Pappas]] from the village of [[Emmanouil Pappas|Dobista]], [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres]], who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria in 1819. Pappas had considerable influence over the local Ottoman authorities, especially the local governor, Ismail Bey, and offered much of his personal wealth for the cause.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia''</ref>\n\nFollowing the instructions of Alexander Ypsilantis, that is to prepare the ground and to rouse the inhabitants of Macedonia to rebellion, Pappas loaded arms and munitions from Constantinople on a ship on 23 March and proceeded to [[Mount Athos]], considering that this would be the most suitable spring-board for starting the insurrection. As Vacalopoulos notes, however, \"adequate preparations for rebellion had not been made, nor were revolutionary ideals to be reconciled with the ideological world of the monks within the Athonite regime\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.592</ref> On 8 May, the Turks, infuriated by the landing of sailors from [[Psara]] at [[Stomio, Larissa|Tsayezi]], by the capture of Turkish merchants and the seizure of their goods, rampaged through the streets of Serres, searched the houses of the notables for arms, imprisoned the Metropolitan and 150 merchants, and seized their goods as a reprisal for the plundering by the Psarians.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;594\u2013595</ref>\n\nIn Thessaloniki, governor Yusuf Bey (the son of Ismail Bey) imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages, of whom more than 100 were monks from the monastic estates. He also wished to seize the powerful notables of [[Polygyros]], who got wind of his intentions and fled. On 17 May, the Greeks of Polygyros took up arms, killed the local governor and 14 of his men, and wounded three others; they also repulsed two Turkish detachments. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the incidents at Polygyros and the spreading of the insurrection to the villages of [[Chalkidiki]], he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations:\n{{quote|Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning.

In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between [[Thrace]] and the south, attempting to prevent the ''[[serasker]]'' Haji Muhammad Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed him, they were ultimately defeated at the pass of [[Rentina, Thessaloniki|Rentina]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.609</ref>\n\nThe insurrection in Chalkidiki was, from then on, confined to the peninsulas of Mount Athos and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Muhammad Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to [[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]] and [[Skyros]]. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]. [[Sithonia]], Mount Athos and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;615\u2013619</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the revolt spread from [[central Macedonia|Central]] to [[Western Macedonia]], from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] and [[Vermion Mountains|Vermion]]. In the autumn of 1821, Nikolaos Kasomoulis was sent to southern Greece as the \"representative of South-East Macedonia\", and met Demetrius Ypsilantis. He then wrote to Papas from Hydra, asking him to visit Olympus to meet the captains there and to \"fire them with the required patriotic enthusiasm\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;627\u2013628</ref> At the beginning of 1822, [[Anastasios Karatasos]] and [[Aggelis Gatsos]] arranged a meeting with other ''armatoloi''; they decided that the insurrection should be based on three towns: [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]], [[Kastania (Pieria), Greece|Kastania]], and [[Siatista]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;628\u2013629</ref>\n\nIn March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive victories at [[Kolindros]] and Kastania.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;633\u2013636</ref> Further north, in the vicinity of Naousa, [[Zafeirakis Theodosiou]], Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city's defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks. Mehmed Emin then appeared before the town with 10,000 regular troops and 10,600 irregulars. Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the \"Alonia\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;635\u2013637</ref> Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and being sold in slavery.

They landed at Asprovrisi of Lapithou. Kanaris brought with him papers from the Filiki Etaireia and the ships were welcomed with rapturous applause and patriotic cries from the local Greeks of the area, who helped Kanaris and the soldiers from Cyprus as much as they could.\n\nKanaris brought with him to mainland  Greece, Cypriots who created the \"Column of Cypriots\" (\u00ab\u03a6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\u00bb), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with extraordinary heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared \"These were given to me by the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots\". In the National Library, there is a list of 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.\n\nThe Cypriot battalion brought with them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words ''GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS'' emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved and pointed at the end to act as a lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.\n\n[[File:\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Painting of the Archbishop [[Kyprianos of Cyprus]]]]\n\nThroughout the War of Independence, supplies were brought from Cyprus by the Filiki Etairia to aid the Greek struggle. The Greeks of Cyprus underwent great risk to provide these supplies, and secretly load them onto boats arriving at intervals from Greece, as the Ottoman rulers in Cyprus at the time were very wary of Cypriot insurgency and sentenced to death any Greek Cypriots found aiding the Greek cause. Incidences of these secret loading trips from Cyprus were recorded by the French consul to Cyprus, Mechain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325235958/http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBack in Cyprus during the war, the local population suffered greatly at the hands of the Ottoman rulers of the islands, who were quick to act with great severity at any act of patriotism and sympathy of the Greeks of Cyprus to the Revolution, fearing a similar uprising in Cyprus. The religious leader of the Greeks of the island at the time, [[Archbishop Kyprianos]] was initiated into the Filiki Etairia in 1818 and had promised to aid the cause of the Greek Helladites with food and money.\n\nIn early July 1821, the Cypriot Archimandrite Theofylaktos Thiseas arrived in [[Larnaca]] as a messenger of the Filiki Etairia, bringing orders to Kyprianos, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. However, the local pasha, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha, intercepted these messages and reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened, but refused to do so.\n\nOn 9 July 1821 K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios (bishop of Kyrenia). The next day, all abbots and monks of monasteries in Cyprus were executed. In addition, the Ottomans arrested all the Greek leaders of the villages and imprisoned them before executing them, as they were suspected of inspiring patriotism in their local population.\n\nIn total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time. K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck pasha had declared ''\"I have in my mind to slaughter the Greeks in Cyprus, to hang them, to not leave a soul...\"'' before undertaking these massacres. From 9 to 14 July, the Ottomans killed all prisoners on the list of the pasha, and in the next 30 days, looting and massacres spread throughout Cyprus as 4,000 Turkish soldiers from Syria arrived on the island.\n\nArchbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He was aware of his fate and impending death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer by the name of Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: \"My death is not far away. I know they [the Ottoman] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me\". Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader.\n\nHe was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus on 19 July 1821. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by [[Vassilis Michaelides]].\n\n===War at sea===\n[[File:Aris figurehead of Tsamadoy ship.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[figurehead]] of [[Anastasios Tsamados]]\u2019 famous brig [[Greek brig Aris|Aris]], today in the [[National Historical Museum, Athens]].]]\n\nFrom the early stages of the revolution, success at sea was vital for the Greeks. When they failed to counter the [[Ottoman Navy]], it was able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces, theatening to crush the rebellion; likewise the failure of the Greek fleet to break the naval blocade of Missolonghi (as it did several times earlier) in 1826 led to the fall of the city.\n\nThe Greek fleet was primarily outfitted by prosperous Aegean islanders, principally from three islands: [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], [[Spetses]] and [[Psara]]. Each island equipped, manned and maintained its own squadron, under its own admiral.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\">Brewer, pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Although they were manned by experienced crews, the Greek ships were not designed for warfare, equipped with only light guns and staffed by armed merchantmen.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\"/> Against them stood the Ottoman fleet, which enjoyed several advantages: its ships and supporting craft were built for war; it was supported by the resources of the vast Ottoman Empire; command was centralized and disciplined under the [[Kapudan Pasha]]. The total Ottoman fleet size consisted of 20 three-masted [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], each with about 80 guns and 7 or 8 [[frigate]]s with 50 guns, 5 corvettes with about 30 guns and around 40 [[brig]]s with 20 or fewer guns.<ref>Brewer, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 - \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2.jpg|thumb|240px|\"The burning of the Ottoman frigate at Eressos by [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]\" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]\n\nIn the face of this situation, the Greeks decided to use [[fire ship]]s ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac or \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1}}), which had proven themselves effective for the Psarians during the [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770. The first test was made at [[Eresos]] on 27 May 1821, when an Ottoman frigate was successfully destroyed by a fire ship under [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]. In the fire ships, the Greeks found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. In subsequent years, the successes of the Greek fire ships would increase their reputation, with acts such as the destruction of the Ottoman flagship by [[Constantine Kanaris]] at [[Chios]], after the [[Chios Massacre|massacre of the island's population in June 1822]], acquiring international fame. {{citation needed span|Overall, 59 fire ship attacks were carried out, of which 39 were successful.|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the same time, conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]] distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at Patras and Spetses gave the crews confidence and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese.\n\nLater, however, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of [[Kasos]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]] in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Despite victories at [[Samos Island|Samos]] and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n==1822\u20131824==\n[[File:Mavrokordatos by Hess.jpg|thumb|180px|\"[[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]], president of the Executive, defends Missolonghi\" (''[[First Siege of Missolonghi]]''), by [[Peter von Hess]].]]\n[[File:Dionysios Solomos - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote in 1823 the ''[[Hymn to Liberty]]'', which later became the National Greek anthem.]]\n\nRevolutionary activity was fragmented because of the lack of strong central leadership and guidance.

The Assembly drafted the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of limited significance.<ref>Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87\u20139.</ref>\n\nMilitary leaders and representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]]. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of regional bodies, a [[Greek Constitution of 1823|new constitution]] was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and the legislative bodies.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 143\u2013151</ref>\n\nTrying to coax the military leaders, the central administration proposed to Kolokotronis that he participate in the executive body as vice-president. Kolokotronis accepted, but he caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused outrage amongst the members of the legislative body.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 152\u2013154</ref>\n\nThe crisis culminated when the legislature, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots, overturned the executive, and fired its president, Petros Mavromichalis. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, and some Achaean notables\u2014[[Andreas Zaimis]] and [[Andreas Londos]] were the most prominent\u2014was formed at [[Kranidi]] with [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] as president.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 154\u2013161</ref>\n\nIn March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Nafplion and Tripolitsa. After one month of fighting and negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other side. On 22 May, the first phase of the civil war officially ended, but most of the members of the new executive were displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the two first installments of the English loan had arrived, and the position of the government was strengthened; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body, and allied with Kolokotronis, who roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, but Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period, overwhelmed by the death of his son, Panos.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 164\u2013170.</ref>\n\nThe government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Souliotes, led by [[Ioannis Kolettis]], who wanted a complete victory. Under Kolettis' orders, two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliotes invaded the Peloponnese: the first under Gouras occupied [[Corinth]] and raided the province; the second under Karaiskakis, [[Kitsos Tzavelas]] and others, attacked in Achaea, Lindos and \"Zaimis\". In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others.

They recognized the degeneration of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but they did not know how to handle this situation (a problem known as the \"Eastern Question\"). Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]], Austrian foreign minister Prince [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], and the Tsar of Russia [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the [[Concert of Europe]].\n\nMetternich also tried to undermine the Russian foreign minister, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian [[Carbonari]] (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to disavow him. As a result of the Russian reaction to Alexander Ypsilantis, Kapodistrias resigned as foreign minister and moved to [[Switzerland]].<ref>Troyat, ''Alexander of Russia'', pp. 269\u2013270</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Alexander's position was ambivalent, since he regarded himself as the protector of the Orthodox Church, and his subjects were deeply moved by the hanging of the Patriarch. These factors explain why, after denouncing the Greek Revolution, Alexander dispatched an ultimatum to Constantinople on 27 July 1821, after the Greek massacres in the city and the hanging of the Patriarch.\n\nHowever, the danger of war passed temporarily, after Metternich and Castlereagh persuaded the Sultan to make some concessions to the Tsar.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 286\u2013288</ref> On 14 December 1822, the Holy Alliance denounced the Greek Revolution, considering it audacious.\n\n===Change of stance===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = George Canning by Richard Evans.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Nicholasbotman(1).jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[George Canning]] was the architect of the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]], which launched European intervention in the Greek conflict.<br />Right:[[Tsar Nicholas I]] co-signed the Treaty of London, and then launched the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828\u20131829, which finally secured Greek independence.\n}}\n\nIn August 1822, [[George Canning]] was appointed by the British government as Foreign Secretary, succeeding Castlereagh. Canning was influenced by the mounting popular agitation against the Ottomans, and believed that a settlement could no longer be postponed. He also feared that Russia might undertake unilateral action against the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', p. 288</ref>\n\nIn March 1823, Canning declared that \"when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war\". In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the [[Ionian Islands]], which belonged to Britain, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war and give them the right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.<ref name=\"Br52\" />\n\nThese measures led to the increase of British influence. This influence was reinforced by the issuing of two loans that the Greeks managed to conclude with British fund-holders in 1824 and 1825. These loans, which, in effect, made the City of London the financier of the revolution,<ref name=\"Br52\" /> inspired the creation of the \"British\" political party in Greece, whose opinion was that the revolution could only end in success with the help of Britain. At the same time, parties affiliated to Russia and France made their appearance. These parties would later strive for power during king Otto's reign.<ref>\"Newer and Modern History\"(\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7), Vas.

Metternich  dismissively wrote, \"If the Irish were to revolt against the British Crown, and the King of France were to offer to mediate,\" leading him to ask: \"Is England then ready to regard as a Power equal to rights to that of the [British] King the first Irish Club which declares itself the Insurgent Government of Ireland? To regard as justified the French Power which would accept the office of mediator, by reason of the sole fact that the invitation had been addressed to it by the Irish Government?...Whither does this absurdity not lead us?\".<ref name=\"Brewer, David pages 257\">Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 257.</ref> Prussia, whose king Frederich Wilhelm was close to Metternich, chose to follow the Austrian lead.<ref name=\"Brewer, David pages 257\"/> Before he met with Wellington, the Tsar had already sent an ultimatum to the Porte, demanding that the principalities be evacuated immediately, and that plenipotentiaries be sent to Russia to settle outstanding issues. The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the [[Akkerman Convention]], in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nThe Greeks formally applied for the mediation provided in the Petersburg Protocol, while the Turks and the Egyptians showed no willingness to stop fighting.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 316</ref> France, which initially backed its client Muhammad Ali the Great with weapons and officers to train his army, changed its stance, partly because of the pro-Greek feelings of the French people, and partly because King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] saw the offer to impose mediation as a way of assuring French influence in Greece.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 316-317</ref> Since Britain and Russia were going to impose mediation with or without France, if the French declined the offer to impose mediation, Greece would be in the Anglo-Russian sphere of influence, while if the French did take part, then Greece would also be in the French sphere of influence.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 317</ref> Canning therefore prepared for action by negotiating the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] (6 July 1827) with France and Russia. This provided that the Allies should again offer negotiations, and if the Sultan rejected it, they would exert all the means which circumstances would allow to force the cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, news reached Greece in late July 1827 that Muhammad Ali's new fleet was completed in [[Alexandria]] and sailing towards [[Pylos|Navarino]] to join the rest of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. The aim of this fleet was to attack Hydra and knock the island's fleet out of the war. On 29 August, the Porte formally rejected the Treaty of London's stipulations, and, subsequently, the commanders-in-chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French]] Mediterranean fleets, Admiral [[Edward Codrington]] and Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]], sailed into the Gulf of Argos and requested to meet with Greek representatives on board {{HMS|Asia|1824|6}}.<ref name=\"Howarth231\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 231</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Navarino (1827)====\n{{Main|Battle of Navarino}}\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (by [[Auguste Couder]], 1841, [[Palace of Versailles]]), whose expedition to the Peloponnese precipitated European intervention in the Greek conflict.]]\n\nAfter the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, accepted the terms of the treaty, the Allies prepared to insist upon the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim's forces. When Muhammad Ali's fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Login Geiden]].<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 231\u201334.</ref>\n\nUpon their arrival at Navarino, Codgrinton and de Rigny tried to negotiate with Ibrahim, but Ibrahim insisted that by the Sultan's order he must destroy Hydra. Codrington responded by saying that if Ibrahim's fleets attempted to go anywhere but home, he would have to destroy them. Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders, but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that he would stop the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\"/>\n\nHowever, when [[Frank Abney Hastings|Frank Hastings]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]], destroyed a Turkish naval squadron during a [[Battle of Itea|raid off Itea]], Ibrahim sent a detachment of his fleet out of Navarino in order to defeat Hastings. Codrington had not heard of Hastings's actions and thought that Ibrahim was breaking his agreement. Codrington intercepted the force and made them retreat and did so again on the following day when Ibrahim led the fleet in person. Codrington assembled his fleet once more, with the British returning from Malta and the French from the Aegean. They were also joined by the Russian contingent led by Count Login Geiden. Ibrahim now began a campaign to annihilate the Greeks of the Peloponnese as he thought the Allies had reneged on their agreement.<ref name=\"Howarth236-37\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 236\u201337.</ref>\n\n[[File:Naval Battle of Navarino by Garneray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''The Naval [[Battle of Navarino]]'' by [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]] (1827).]]\n\nOn 20 October 1827, as the weather got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in peaceful formation to shelter themselves and to make sure that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British [[frigate]] sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire.<ref name=\"Howarth239\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 239.</ref> A full engagement was begun which ended in a complete victory for the Allies and in the annihilation of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. Of the 89 Egyptian-Turkish ships that took part in the battle, only 14 made it back to Alexandria and their dead amounted to over 8,000. The Allies did not lose a ship and suffered only 181 deaths. The Porte demanded compensation from the Allies for the ships, but his demand was refused on the grounds that the Turks had acted as the aggressors. The three countries' ambassadors also left Constantinople.<ref name=\"Howarth241\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 241.</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the battle was criticized as being an 'untoward event' towards Turkey, which was called an 'ancient ally'. Codrington was recalled and blamed for having allowed the retreating Egyptian-Turkish ships to carry 2,000 Greek slaves. In France, the news of the battle was greeted with great enthusiasm and the government had an unexpected surge in popularity. Russia formally took the opportunity to declare war on the Turks (April 1828).<ref name=\"Howarth241\"/>\n[[File:Entrevue du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Maison et d'Ibrahim Pacha, \u00e0 Navarin, septembre 1828.jpg|thumb|310x310px|''[[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] meeting [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in [[Pylos|Navarino]] in September 1828'' (by [[Jean-Charles Langlois]],1838, [[Palace of Versailles]]).]]\n\nIn October 1828, the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government under [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]]. Kapodistrias took advantage of the Russo-Turkish war and sent troops of the reorganised [[Hellenic Army]] to [[Central Greece]]. They advanced to seize as much territory as possible, including [[Athens]] and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. These Greek victories were proved decisive for the including of more territories in the future State. As far as the Peloponnese was concerned, Britain and Russia accepted the offer of France to send an army to expel Ibrahim's forces. [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], who was given command of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary Corps]] of 15,000 men, landed on 30 August 1828 at [[Petalidi]] and helped the Greeks evacuate the Peloponnese from all the hostile troops by 30 October.

Greek forces under Demetrius Ypsilantis, for the first time trained to fight as a regular European army rather than as guerrilla bands, advanced against Aslan Bey's forces and defeated them.

There is debate among scholars over whether the massacres committed by the Greeks should be regarded as a response to prior events (such as the massacre of the Greeks of Tripoli, after the failed [[Orlov Revolt]] of 1770 and the destruction of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]<ref>Booras, ''Hellenic Independence and America's Contribution to the Cause''. p. 24.<br />* Brewer, ''The Greek War of Independence'', p. 64.</ref>) or as separate atrocities, which started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt.<ref>Finlay, ''History of the Greek Revolution'', I, 171\u2013172<br />* Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 217<br />* St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 1\u20133, 12</ref>\n\nDuring the war, tens of thousands of Greek civilians were killed, left to die or taken into slavery.<ref>St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 80\u201381, 92</ref> Most of the Greeks in the Greek quarter of Constantinople were massacred.<ref>[[Fisher, H.A.L]], ''A History of Europe'', (Edward Arnold, London, 1936 & 1965) p. 882</ref> A large number of Christian clergymen were also killed, including the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory V.{{cref|viii}}\n\nSometimes marked as allies of the Turks in the Peloponnese, Jewish settlements were also massacred by Greek revolutionaries; Steve Bowman argues that the tragedy may have been more a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South, where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews as such. Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called [[Zionism]].<ref name=\"Rivlin\">Bowman, \"The Jews of Greece\", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421\u2013422] (PDF)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Theodoros Vryzakis, Grateful Hellas (1858).jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Grateful Hellas\" by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]\n\nThe consequences of the Greek revolution were somewhat ambiguous in the immediate aftermath. An independent Greek state had been established, but with Britain, Russia and France claiming a major role in Greek politics, an imported Bavarian dynast as ruler, and a mercenary army.<ref name=\"Jelavich229-34\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', pp.&nbsp;229\u201334.</ref> The country had been ravaged by ten years of fighting and was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates, necessitating a series of land reforms over several decades.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nThe population of the new state numbered 800,000, representing less than one-third of the 2.5&nbsp;million Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. During a great part of the next century, the Greek state sought the liberation of the \"[[irredentism|unredeemed]]\" Greeks of the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the [[Megali Idea]], i.e., the goal of uniting all Greeks in one country.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nAs a people, the Greeks no longer provided the princes for the Danubian Principalities, and were regarded within the Ottoman Empire, especially by the Muslim population, as traitors. [[Phanariotes]], who had until then held high office within the Ottoman Empire, were thenceforth regarded as suspect, and lost their special, privileged status. In Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire where Greek banking and merchant presence had been dominant, Armenians mostly replaced Greeks in banking, and Jewish merchants gained importance.<ref name=\"Jelavich229\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 229</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Today the fatherland is reborn, that for so long was lost and extinguished.

For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically-based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Albanians]], [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians]] all subsequently fought for and won their independence.\n\nShortly after the war ended, the people of the Russian-dependent [[Congress Poland|Poland]], encouraged by the Greek victory, started the [[November Uprising]], hoping to regain their independence. The uprising, however, failed, and Polish independence had to wait until 1918. The newly established Greek state would become a catalyst for further expansion and, over the course of a century, [[Macedonia (Greece)|parts of Macedonia]], [[Crete]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], many [[Aegean Islands]] and other Greek-speaking territories would unite with the new Greek state.\nThe Greek rebels won the sympathy of even the conservative powers of Europe.\n\n==Revolutionary flags==\n<Center>\n<gallery>\nFile:YpsilantisFlag.svg|Flag of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]\nFile:Andreas Lontos Flag (Revolution1821).svg|Raised in [[Patras]] by [[Andreas Londos]]\nFile:Greek flag (black cross).svg|Flag from Thrace and Samothrace\nFile:1821 Flag of Spetses.svg|Flag of [[Spetses]] island\nFile:Athanasios Diakos 1821.svg|Flag of [[Athanasios Diakos]]\nFile:Mani Flag (Greece).svg|Flag of the [[Maniots]]\nFile:Thessalia-flag.jpg|Used in Thessaly, created by [[Anthimos Gazis]]\nFile:Flag of the Administration of Samos.svg|Flag of the [[Military-Political System of Samos]]\nFile:Greek Independence 1821.svg|Very widespread flag used by all the revolutionaries\n</gallery>\n</Center>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|Celebration of the Greek Revolution}}\n\n===Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence===\nIn 1971, the [[Municipality of Thessaloniki]] commissioned a symphonic work for the 150th anniversary of the Greek Revolution.

[[Rigas Feraios]] (1757 \u2013 1798) was a very prominent poet and intellectual of Greek independence. Many of his poems urged the people of Greece to leave the cities, head to the mountains where they would have more freedom, and unite to gain their independence.\n\n[[Dionysios Solomos]] (1798 \u2013 1857) was another national poet inspired by the Greek War of Independence. Solomos wrote the [[Hymn to Liberty]] in 1823, two years after the Greeks started the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Hymn is 158 stanzas, making it one of the longest [[National Anthem]]s; however, officially, only the first two were adopted and sung. Not only is it the Greek anthem but also [[Cyprus]] adopted it as their own in 1966.\n\nTo this day, many songs are sung by Greeks worldwide on March 25 to [[Celebration of the Greek Revolution|celebrate their liberation]] and showcase their respect to the lives that were lost during the four hundred years Ottoman rule.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence\n!Song Name\n!Sung by\n!Released\n|-\n|'''Na'tane To 21'''\n\u039d\u03b1'\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03a4\u03bf 21\n|[[George Dalaras]]\n\u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\n|1970\n|-\n|'''O Thourios Tou Riga'''\n\u039f \u0398\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\n|[[Nikos Xilouris]]\n\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039e\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2\n|1797 (the poem)\n|-\n|'''Ola Ta Ethni Polemoun'''\n'\u039f\u03bb\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b1 \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\n|Rigas Feraios & Christos Leontis\n\n\u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 & \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Saranta Palikaria'''\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\n|[[Stelios Kazantzidis]]\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Perifanoi Oloi'''\n\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u0384\u039f\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\n|Paschalis Arvanitidis\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|1967\n|-\n|'''Kleftiki Zoi'''\n\u039a\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\n|[[Loukianos Kilaidonis]]\n\u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b7\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\n|1992\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Evzones]]\n* [[Greek National Awakening]]\n* [[Morea expedition|Morea Expedition (1828-1833)]]\n* [[Phoenix (currency)]]\n* [[Propylaea (Munich)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Cnote|i|Adanir refers to the \"mountainous districts such as [[Mani peninsula|Mani]] in the Peloponnese or [[Souliotes|Souli]] and [[Himara]] in Epirus, which had never been completely subjugated\".<ref>Adanir, \"Semi-autonomous Forces\", pp. 159\u2013160</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|ii|Re\u02bf\u00e2y\u00e2.

The revolution is celebrated in [[Greece]] and by Greeks around the world as [[Greek Independence Day|independence day]] on 25 March.\n\n[[Greece]] came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century, in the decades before and after the [[fall of Constantinople]].<ref>{{cite book|first =Caroline |last=Finkel|title =Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire|isbn = 9780465008506|date = 2007|publisher = Basic Books |page = 17|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9cTHyUQoTyUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA17}}</ref> During the following centuries, there were sporadic but unsuccessful [[Ottoman Greece#Uprisings before 1821|Greek uprisings]] against Ottoman rule. <ref>Woodhouse, ''A Story of Modern Greece'', 'The Dark Age of Greece (1453\u20131800)', p. 113, Faber and Faber (1968)</ref> In 1814, a secret organization called [[Filiki Eteria]] (Society of Friends) was founded with the aim of liberating Greece, encouraged by the revolutionary fervor gripping Europe in that period. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]], and [[Constantinople]] itself. The insurrection was planned for 25 March 1821 (on the Julian Calendar), the Orthodox Christian [[Feast of the Annunciation]]. However, the plans of Filiki Eteria were discovered by the Ottoman authorities, forcing the revolution to start earlier. The first revolt began on 6 March/21 February 1821 in the [[Danubian Principalities]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese ([[Morea]]) into action and on 17 March 1821, the [[Maniots]] were first to declare war. In September 1821, the Greeks under the leadership of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. Revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], and [[Central Greece]] broke out, but were eventually suppressed. Meanwhile, makeshift Greek fleets achieved success against the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.\n\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] called in his vassal [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gains. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and brought most of the peninsula under Egyptian control by the end of that year. The town of [[Missolonghi]] fell in April 1826 after a [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|year-long siege]] by the Turks. Despite a [[Ottoman\u2013Egyptian invasion of Mani|failed invasion of Mani]], Athens also fell and the revolution looked all but lost.\n\nAt that point, the three Great Powers\u2014Russia, Britain and France\u2014decided to intervene, sending their naval squadrons to Greece in 1827. Following news that the combined Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet was going to attack the island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied European fleets intercepted the Ottoman navy at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. After a tense week-long standoff, the [[Battle of Navarino]] led to the destruction of the Ottoman\u2013Egyptian fleet and turned the tide in favor of the revolutionaries. In 1828 the Egyptian army withdrew under pressure of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]]. The Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese surrendered, and the Greek revolutionaries proceeded to retake central Greece. Russia invaded the Ottoman Empire and forced it to accept Greek autonomy in the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)]]. After nine years of war, Greece was finally recognized as an independent state under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] of February 1830. Further negotiations in 1832 led to the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]] and the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]]; these defined the final borders of the new state and established [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto]] of Bavaria as the first king of Greece.\n\n\n==Background==\n{{Details|Background of the Greek War of Independence}}\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{See also|Ottoman Greece}}\nThe [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29&nbsp;May 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the [[Byzantine Empire]] marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty.

Throughout the 17th century there was great resistance to the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] in the [[Morea]] and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by [[Dionysius the Philosopher]].<ref name=\"Kassis29\">Kassis, ''Mani's History'', p. 29.</ref> After the [[Morean War]], the [[Peloponnese]] came under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule for 30 years, and remained in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as the bands of [[klepht]]s multiplied.<ref name=\"Kassis31-33\">Kassis, ''Mani's History'', pp. 31\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe first great uprising was the Russian-sponsored [[Orlov Revolt]] of the 1770s, which was crushed by the Ottomans after having limited success.

Greeks controlled the affairs of the Orthodox Church through the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], as the higher clergy of the Orthodox Church was mostly of Greek origin. Thus, as a result of the Ottoman [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], the predominantly Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate enjoyed control over the Empire's Orthodox subjects (the ''Rum milleti''<ref name=\"Arnakis, p. 238\">Georgiadis\u2013Arnakis, ''The Greek Church of Constantinople'', p. 238</ref>).<ref name=\"B118\" />\n\nThe [[Greek Orthodox Church]] played a pivotal role in the preservation of national identity, the development of Greek society and the resurgence of Greek nationalism.{{cref|iii}} From the early 18th century and onwards, members of prominent Greek families in Constantinople, known as [[Phanariotes]] (after the [[Fener|Phanar]] district of the city) gained considerable control over Ottoman foreign policy and eventually over the bureaucracy as a whole.<ref>Paparrigopoulos, ''History of the Hellenic Nation'', Eb, p. 108<br />* Svoronos, ''The Greek Nation'', p. 89<br />* Trudgill, \"Greece and European Turkey\", p. 241</ref>\n\n====Klephts and armatoloi====\n[[File:BoningtonArmatolos.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a Greek armatolos by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] (oil painting, 1825\u20131826, Benaki Museum)]]\n\nIn times of militarily weak central authority, the Balkan countryside became infested by groups of bandits called \"[[klepht]]s\" ({{lang-el|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}}) (the Greek equivalent of the [[hajduk]]s) that struck at Muslims and Christians alike.

[[Peter the Great]] had envisaged a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the re-institution of a new Byzantine Empire with an Orthodox emperor. His [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1711 set a precedent for the Greeks, when Peter appealed to Orthodox Christians to join the Russians and rise against the Turks to fight for \"''faith and homeland''\".  The Russo-Turkish wars of Catherine II (1762-1796) made the Greeks  consider their emancipation with the aid of Russia. An independence movement in Peloponnesus (Morea) was incited by Russian agents in 1769, and a Greek flotilla under Lambros Katsonis assisted the Russian fleet in the war of 1788-1792.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwbHCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Lucien J.

Korais' primary intellectual inspiration was from the Enlightenment, and he borrowed ideas from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent the remainder of his life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy that came out of it.

Byron's death helped to create an even stronger European sympathy for the Greek cause.

Fearing that his followers might surrender him to the Turks, he gave out that Austria had declared war on Turkey, caused a [[Te Deum]] to be sung in [[Cozia Monastery]], and on pretext of arranging measures with the Austrian commander-in-chief, he crossed the frontier. However, the reactionary policies of the [[Holy Alliance]] were enforced by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] and the country refused to give asylum for leaders of revolts in neighboring countries.

There, [[Papaflessas]], a pro-revolution priest who presented himself as representative of [[Filiki Eteria]] clashed with most of the civil leaders and members of the senior clergy, such as [[Germanos III of Old Patras|Metropolitan Germanos of Patras]], who were sceptical and demanded guarantees about a Russian intervention.<ref>Papageorgiou, \"First Year of Freedom\", p. 59.</ref>\n\n[[File:Anagnostaras by Hess.jpg|thumb|left|170px|''[[Anagnostis Papageorgiou|Anagnostaras]] during the [[Battle of Valtetsi]]'' by Peter von Hess.]]\n\nAs news came of Ypsilantis' march into the Danubian Principalities, the atmosphere in the Peloponnese was tense, and by mid-March, sporadic incidents against Muslims occurred, heralding the start of the uprising.

The ideals and patriotic songs of Rigas Feraios and others had made a profound impression upon the Thessalonians. \u0391 few years later, the revolutionary fervour of the southern Greeks was to spread to these parts, and the seeds of Filiki Eteria were speedily to take root. The leader and coordinator of the revolution in Macedonia was [[Emmanouel Pappas]] from the village of [[Emmanouil Pappas|Dobista]], [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres]], who was initiated into the Filiki Eteria in 1819. Pappas had considerable influence over the local Ottoman authorities, especially the local governor, Ismail Bey, and offered much of his personal wealth for the cause.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia''</ref>\n\nFollowing the instructions of Alexander Ypsilantis, that is to prepare the ground and to rouse the inhabitants of Macedonia to rebellion, Pappas loaded arms and munitions from Constantinople on a ship on 23 March and proceeded to [[Mount Athos]], considering that this would be the most suitable spring-board for starting the insurrection. As Vacalopoulos notes, however, \"adequate preparations for rebellion had not been made, nor were revolutionary ideals to be reconciled with the ideological world of the monks within the Athonite regime\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.592</ref> On 8 May, the Turks, infuriated by the landing of sailors from [[Psara]] at [[Stomio, Larissa|Tsayezi]], by the capture of Turkish merchants and the seizure of their goods, rampaged through the streets of Serres, searched the houses of the notables for arms, imprisoned the Metropolitan and 150 merchants, and seized their goods as a reprisal for the plundering by the Psarians.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;594\u2013595</ref>\n\nIn Thessaloniki, governor Yusuf Bey (the son of Ismail Bey) imprisoned in his headquarters more than 400 hostages, of whom more than 100 were monks from the monastic estates. He also wished to seize the powerful notables of [[Polygyros]], who got wind of his intentions and fled. On 17 May, the Greeks of Polygyros took up arms, killed the local governor and 14 of his men, and wounded three others; they also repulsed two Turkish detachments. On 18 May, when Yusuf learned of the incidents at Polygyros and the spreading of the insurrection to the villages of [[Chalkidiki]], he ordered half of his hostages to be slaughtered before his eyes. The Mulla of Thessalonica, Hayr\u0131\u00fclah, gives the following description of Yusuf's retaliations:\n{{quote|Every day and every night you hear nothing in the streets of Thessaloniki but shouting and moaning.

In June 1821 the insurgents tried to cut communications between [[Thrace]] and the south, attempting to prevent the ''[[serasker]]'' Haji Muhammad Bayram Pasha from transferring forces from Asia Minor to southern Greece. Even though the rebels delayed him, they were ultimately defeated at the pass of [[Rentina, Thessaloniki|Rentina]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', p.609</ref>\n\nThe insurrection in Chalkidiki was, from then on, confined to the peninsulas of Mount Athos and Kassandra. On 30 October 1821, an offensive led by the new Pasha of Thessaloniki, Muhammad Emin Abulubud, resulted in a decisive Ottoman victory at Kassandra. The survivors, among them Pappas, were rescued by the Psarian fleet, which took them mainly to [[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]] and [[Skyros]]. However, Pappas died en route to join the revolution at [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]. [[Sithonia]], Mount Athos and Thasos subsequently surrendered on terms.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;615\u2013619</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the revolt spread from [[central Macedonia|Central]] to [[Western Macedonia]], from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] and [[Vermion Mountains|Vermion]]. In the autumn of 1821, Nikolaos Kasomoulis was sent to southern Greece as the \"representative of South-East Macedonia\", and met Demetrius Ypsilantis. He then wrote to Papas from Hydra, asking him to visit Olympus to meet the captains there and to \"fire them with the required patriotic enthusiasm\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;627\u2013628</ref> At the beginning of 1822, [[Anastasios Karatasos]] and [[Aggelis Gatsos]] arranged a meeting with other ''armatoloi''; they decided that the insurrection should be based on three towns: [[Naousa, Imathia|Naoussa]], [[Kastania (Pieria), Greece|Kastania]], and [[Siatista]].<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;628\u2013629</ref>\n\nIn March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive victories at [[Kolindros]] and Kastania.<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;633\u2013636</ref> Further north, in the vicinity of Naousa, [[Zafeirakis Theodosiou]], Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city's defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks.

Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the \"Alonia\".<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia'', pp.&nbsp;635\u2013637</ref> Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and being sold in slavery.

They landed at Asprovrisi of Lapithou. Kanaris brought with him papers from the Filiki Etaireia and the ships were welcomed with rapturous applause and patriotic cries from the local Greeks of the area, who helped Kanaris and the soldiers from Cyprus as much as they could.\n\nKanaris brought with him to mainland  Greece, Cypriots who created the \"Column of Cypriots\" (\u00ab\u03a6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd\u00bb), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with extraordinary heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared \"These were given to me by the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots\". In the National Library, there is a list of 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.\n\nThe Cypriot battalion brought with them their own distinctive war banner, consisting of a white flag with a large blue cross, and the words ''GREEK FLAG OF THE MOTHERLAND CYPRUS'' emblazoned in the top left corner. The flag was hoisted on a wooden mast, carved and pointed at the end to act as a lance in battle. The legendary battle flag is currently stored at the National Historical Museum of Athens.\n\n[[File:\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Painting of the Archbishop [[Kyprianos of Cyprus]]]]\n\nThroughout the War of Independence, supplies were brought from Cyprus by the Filiki Etairia to aid the Greek struggle. The Greeks of Cyprus underwent great risk to provide these supplies, and secretly load them onto boats arriving at intervals from Greece, as the Ottoman rulers in Cyprus at the time were very wary of Cypriot insurgency and sentenced to death any Greek Cypriots found aiding the Greek cause. Incidences of these secret loading trips from Cyprus were recorded by the French consul to Cyprus, Mechain.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325235958/http://www.synexelixi.org/el/component/content/article/60-kypros-1821 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBack in Cyprus during the war, the local population suffered greatly at the hands of the Ottoman rulers of the islands, who were quick to act with great severity at any act of patriotism and sympathy of the Greeks of Cyprus to the Revolution, fearing a similar uprising in Cyprus. The religious leader of the Greeks of the island at the time, [[Archbishop Kyprianos]] was initiated into the Filiki Etairia in 1818 and had promised to aid the cause of the Greek Helladites with food and money.\n\nIn early July 1821, the Cypriot Archimandrite Theofylaktos Thiseas arrived in [[Larnaca]] as a messenger of the Filiki Etairia, bringing orders to Kyprianos, while proclamations were distributed in every corner of the island. However, the local pasha, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha, intercepted these messages and reacted with fury, calling in reinforcements, confiscating weapons and arresting several prominent Cypriots. Archbishop Kyprianos was urged (by his friends) to leave the island as the situation worsened, but refused to do so.\n\nOn 9 July 1821 K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Pasha had the gates to the walled city of Nicosia closed and executed, by beheading or hanging, 470 important Cypriots amongst them Chrysanthos (bishop of Paphos), Meletios (bishop of Kition) and Lavrentios (bishop of Kyrenia). The next day, all abbots and monks of monasteries in Cyprus were executed. In addition, the Ottomans arrested all the Greek leaders of the villages and imprisoned them before executing them, as they were suspected of inspiring patriotism in their local population.\n\nIn total, it is estimated that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time. K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck pasha had declared ''\"I have in my mind to slaughter the Greeks in Cyprus, to hang them, to not leave a soul...\"'' before undertaking these massacres. From 9 to 14 July, the Ottomans killed all prisoners on the list of the pasha, and in the next 30 days, looting and massacres spread throughout Cyprus as 4,000 Turkish soldiers from Syria arrived on the island.\n\nArchbishop Kyprianos was defiant in his death. He was aware of his fate and impending death, yet stood by the Greek cause. He is revered throughout Cyprus as a noble patriot and defender of the Orthodox faith and Hellenic cause. An English explorer by the name of Carne spoke to the Archbishop before the events of 9 July, who was quoted as saying: \"My death is not far away. I know they [the Ottoman] are waiting for an opportunity to kill me\". Kyprianos chose to stay, despite these fears, and provide protection and counsel for the people of Cyprus as their leader.\n\nHe was publicly hanged from a tree opposite the former palace of the Lusignan Kings of Cyprus on 19 July 1821. The events leading up to his execution were documented in an epic poem written in the Cypriot dialect by [[Vassilis Michaelides]].\n\n===War at sea===\n[[File:Aris figurehead of Tsamadoy ship.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[figurehead]] of [[Anastasios Tsamados]]\u2019 famous brig [[Greek brig Aris|Aris]], today in the [[National Historical Museum, Athens]].]]\n\nFrom the early stages of the revolution, success at sea was vital for the Greeks. When they failed to counter the [[Ottoman Navy]], it was able to resupply the isolated Ottoman garrisons and land reinforcements from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces, theatening to crush the rebellion; likewise the failure of the Greek fleet to break the naval blocade of Missolonghi (as it did several times earlier) in 1826 led to the fall of the city.\n\nThe Greek fleet was primarily outfitted by prosperous Aegean islanders, principally from three islands: [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], [[Spetses]] and [[Psara]]. Each island equipped, manned and maintained its own squadron, under its own admiral.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\">Brewer, pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Although they were manned by experienced crews, the Greek ships were not designed for warfare, equipped with only light guns and staffed by armed merchantmen.<ref name=\"Brewer, pp. 89\u201391\"/> Against them stood the Ottoman fleet, which enjoyed several advantages: its ships and supporting craft were built for war; it was supported by the resources of the vast Ottoman Empire; command was centralized and disciplined under the [[Kapudan Pasha]]. The total Ottoman fleet size consisted of 20 three-masted [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], each with about 80 guns and 7 or 8 [[frigate]]s with 50 guns, 5 corvettes with about 30 guns and around 40 [[brig]]s with 20 or fewer guns.<ref>Brewer, pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 - \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2.jpg|thumb|240px|\"The burning of the Ottoman frigate at Eressos by [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]\" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]\n\nIn the face of this situation, the Greeks decided to use [[fire ship]]s ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac or \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1}}), which had proven themselves effective for the Psarians during the [[Orlov Revolt]] in 1770. The first test was made at [[Eresos]] on 27 May 1821, when an Ottoman frigate was successfully destroyed by a fire ship under [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]]. In the fire ships, the Greeks found an effective weapon against the Ottoman vessels. In subsequent years, the successes of the Greek fire ships would increase their reputation, with acts such as the destruction of the Ottoman flagship by [[Constantine Kanaris]] at [[Chios]], after the [[Chios Massacre|massacre of the island's population in June 1822]], acquiring international fame. {{citation needed span|Overall, 59 fire ship attacks were carried out, of which 39 were successful.|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the same time, conventional naval actions were also fought, at which naval commanders like [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]] distinguished themselves. The early successes of the Greek fleet in direct confrontations with the Ottomans at Patras and Spetses gave the crews confidence and contributed greatly to the survival and success of the uprising in the Peloponnese.\n\nLater, however, as Greece became embroiled in a civil war, the Sultan called upon his strongest subject, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], for aid. Plagued by internal strife and financial difficulties in keeping the fleet in constant readiness, the Greeks failed to prevent the capture and destruction of [[Kasos]] and [[Destruction of Psara|Psara]] in 1824, or the landing of the Egyptian army at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Despite victories at [[Samos Island|Samos]] and Gerontas, the Revolution was threatened with collapse until the intervention of the Great Powers in the [[Battle of Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n==1822\u20131824==\n[[File:Mavrokordatos by Hess.jpg|thumb|180px|\"[[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]], president of the Executive, defends Missolonghi\" (''[[First Siege of Missolonghi]]''), by [[Peter von Hess]].]]\n[[File:Dionysios Solomos - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote in 1823 the ''[[Hymn to Liberty]]'', which later became the National Greek anthem.]]\n\nRevolutionary activity was fragmented because of the lack of strong central leadership and guidance.

The Assembly drafted the [[Greek Constitution of 1822|first Greek Constitution]] and appointed the members of an executive and a legislative body that were to govern the liberated territories. Mavrokordatos saved the office of president of the executive for himself, while Ypsilantis, who had called for the Assembly, was elected president of the legislative body, a place of limited significance.<ref>Dakin, ''The Greek Struggle for independence'', pp. 87\u20139.</ref>\n\nMilitary leaders and representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but gradually Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of [[Nafplion]]. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in [[Astros, Greece|Astros]].

Kolokotronis accepted, but he caused a serious crisis when he prevented Mavrokordatos, who had been elected president of the legislative body, from assuming his position. His attitude towards Mavrokordatos caused outrage amongst the members of the legislative body.<ref>Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 152\u2013154</ref>\n\nThe crisis culminated when the legislature, which was controlled by the Roumeliotes and the Hydriots, overturned the executive, and fired its president, Petros Mavromichalis. Kolokotronis and most of the Peloponnesian notables and captains supported Mavromichalis, who remained president of his executive in Tripolitsa. However, a second executive, supported by the islanders, the Roumeliotes, and some Achaean notables\u2014[[Andreas Zaimis]] and [[Andreas Londos]] were the most prominent\u2014was formed at [[Kranidi]] with [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Kountouriotis]] as president.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 154\u2013161</ref>\n\nIn March 1824, the forces of the new executive besieged Nafplion and Tripolitsa. After one month of fighting and negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kolokotronis, from one side, and Londos and Zaimis, from the other side. On 22 May, the first phase of the civil war officially ended, but most of the members of the new executive were displeased by the moderate terms of the agreement that Londos and Zaimis brokered.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the two first installments of the English loan had arrived, and the position of the government was strengthened; but the infighting was not yet over. Zaimis and the other Peloponnesians who supported Kountouriotis came into conflict with the executive body, and allied with Kolokotronis, who roused the residents of Tripolitsa against the local tax collectors of the government. Papaflessas and Makriyannis failed to suppress the rebellion, but Kolokotronis remained inactive for some period, overwhelmed by the death of his son, Panos.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Dimitropoulos, ''Theodoros Kolokotronis'', 79\u201381<br/>* Rotzokos, \"Civil Wars\", 164\u2013170.</ref>\n\nThe government regrouped its armies, which now consisted mainly of Roumeliotes and Souliotes, led by [[Ioannis Kolettis]], who wanted a complete victory. Under Kolettis' orders, two bodies of Roumeliotes and Souliotes invaded the Peloponnese: the first under Gouras occupied [[Corinth]] and raided the province; the second under Karaiskakis, [[Kitsos Tzavelas]] and others, attacked in Achaea, Lindos and \"Zaimis\". In January 1825, a Roumeliote force, led by Kolettis himself, arrested Kolokotronis, Deligiannis' family and others. In May 1825, under the pressure of the Egyptian intervention, those imprisoned were released and granted amnesty.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Egypt intervenes to assist the Ottomans==\n{{See also|Third Siege of Missolonghi|Ottoman\u2013Egyptian Invasion of Mani}}\n[[File:Ibrahim-messolonghi.jpg|thumb|''Ibrahim attacks Missolonghi'' by Giuseppe Pietro Mazzola]]\n[[File:The sortie of Messologhi by Theodore Vryzakis.jpg|thumb|''The sortie of Missolonghi'' by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]] (1855, oil on canvas, [[National Gallery of Athens]]).]]\n\nOn 19 July 1824, the largest fleet seen in the Mediterranean since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 set sail from Alexandria, consisting of 54 warships and 400 transports carrying 14,000 French-trained infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 500 artillerymen, with some 150 cannons.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 235-236.</ref> Egyptian intervention was initially limited to Crete and Cyprus.

By the end of June, Ibrahim had captured the city of [[Argos]] and was within striking distance of [[Nafplion]]. The city was saved by Makriyannis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis who successfully defended Miloi at the outskirts of Nafplion, making the mills outside the town a fortress causing damage to Ibrahim's far superior forces who were unable to take the position and eventually left for Tripolitsa. Makriyannis was wounded and was taken aboard by Europeans who were overseeing the battle. Among them was De Rigny, who had an argument with Makriyannis and advised him to quit his weak position but Makriyannis ignored him.<ref name=\"el.wikisource.org\"/> Commodore Gawen Hamilton of the [[Royal Navy]], placed his ships in a position which looked like he would assist in the defence of the city.<ref name=\"Howarth233189\"/>\n\n[[File:Karaiskakis landing at Phaleron.jpg|thumb|240px|\"[[Georgios Karaiskakis|Karaiskakis]] landing at Phaliro\" by [[Konstantinos Volanakis]]]]\n\nAt the same time, the Turkish armies in Central Greece were besieging the city of [[Missolonghi]] for the [[Third Siege of Missolonghi|third time]].

They recognized the degeneration of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but they did not know how to handle this situation (a problem known as the \"Eastern Question\"). Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]], Austrian foreign minister Prince [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], and the Tsar of Russia [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the ''status quo'' and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the [[Concert of Europe]].\n\nMetternich also tried to undermine the Russian foreign minister, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], who was of Greek origin. Kapodistrias demanded that Alexander declare war on the Ottomans in order to liberate Greece and increase the greatness of Russia. Metternich persuaded Alexander that Kapodistrias was in league with the Italian [[Carbonari]] (an Italian revolutionary group), leading Alexander to disavow him. As a result of the Russian reaction to Alexander Ypsilantis, Kapodistrias resigned as foreign minister and moved to [[Switzerland]].<ref>Troyat, ''Alexander of Russia'', pp. 269\u2013270</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Alexander's position was ambivalent, since he regarded himself as the protector of the Orthodox Church, and his subjects were deeply moved by the hanging of the Patriarch. These factors explain why, after denouncing the Greek Revolution, Alexander dispatched an ultimatum to Constantinople on 27 July 1821, after the Greek massacres in the city and the hanging of the Patriarch.\n\nHowever, the danger of war passed temporarily, after Metternich and Castlereagh persuaded the Sultan to make some concessions to the Tsar.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 286\u2013288</ref> On 14 December 1822, the Holy Alliance denounced the Greek Revolution, considering it audacious.\n\n===Change of stance===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = George Canning by Richard Evans.jpg\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Nicholasbotman(1).jpg\n| width2 = 210\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[George Canning]] was the architect of the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]], which launched European intervention in the Greek conflict.<br />Right:[[Tsar Nicholas I]] co-signed the Treaty of London, and then launched the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828\u20131829, which finally secured Greek independence.\n}}\n\nIn August 1822, [[George Canning]] was appointed by the British government as Foreign Secretary, succeeding Castlereagh. Canning was influenced by the mounting popular agitation against the Ottomans, and believed that a settlement could no longer be postponed. He also feared that Russia might undertake unilateral action against the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', p. 288</ref>\n\nIn March 1823, Canning declared that \"when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war\". In February 1823 he notified the Ottoman Empire that Britain would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. The Commissioner of the [[Ionian Islands]], which belonged to Britain, was ordered to consider the Greeks in a state of war and give them the right to cut off certain areas from which the Turks could get provisions.<ref name=\"Br52\" />\n\nThese measures led to the increase of British influence. This influence was reinforced by the issuing of two loans that the Greeks managed to conclude with British fund-holders in 1824 and 1825. These loans, which, in effect, made the City of London the financier of the revolution,<ref name=\"Br52\" /> inspired the creation of the \"British\" political party in Greece, whose opinion was that the revolution could only end in success with the help of Britain. At the same time, parties affiliated to Russia and France made their appearance.

The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the [[Akkerman Convention]], in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.<ref>Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nThe Greeks formally applied for the mediation provided in the Petersburg Protocol, while the Turks and the Egyptians showed no willingness to stop fighting.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 316</ref> France, which initially backed its client Muhammad Ali the Great with weapons and officers to train his army, changed its stance, partly because of the pro-Greek feelings of the French people, and partly because King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] saw the offer to impose mediation as a way of assuring French influence in Greece.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 316-317</ref> Since Britain and Russia were going to impose mediation with or without France, if the French declined the offer to impose mediation, Greece would be in the Anglo-Russian sphere of influence, while if the French did take part, then Greece would also be in the French sphere of influence.<ref>Brewer, David ''The Greek War of Independence The Struggle for Freedom from Ottoman Oppression'', London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 317</ref> Canning therefore prepared for action by negotiating the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] (6 July 1827) with France and Russia. This provided that the Allies should again offer negotiations, and if the Sultan rejected it, they would exert all the means which circumstances would allow to force the cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, news reached Greece in late July 1827 that Muhammad Ali's new fleet was completed in [[Alexandria]] and sailing towards [[Pylos|Navarino]] to join the rest of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet. The aim of this fleet was to attack Hydra and knock the island's fleet out of the war. On 29 August, the Porte formally rejected the Treaty of London's stipulations, and, subsequently, the commanders-in-chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|British]] and [[Mediterranean Fleet (France)|French]] Mediterranean fleets, Admiral [[Edward Codrington]] and Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]], sailed into the Gulf of Argos and requested to meet with Greek representatives on board {{HMS|Asia|1824|6}}.<ref name=\"Howarth231\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 231</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Navarino (1827)====\n{{Main|Battle of Navarino}}\n[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (by [[Auguste Couder]], 1841, [[Palace of Versailles]]), whose expedition to the Peloponnese precipitated European intervention in the Greek conflict.]]\n\nAfter the Greek delegation, led by Mavrocordatos, accepted the terms of the treaty, the Allies prepared to insist upon the armistice, and their fleets were instructed to intercept supplies destined for Ibrahim's forces. When Muhammad Ali's fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria and joined other Ottoman/Egyptian units at Navarino on 8 September, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. On 13 October, Codrington was joined, off Navarino, by his allied support, a French squadron under De Rigny and a Russian squadron under [[Login Petrovich Geiden|Login Geiden]].<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 231\u201334.</ref>\n\nUpon their arrival at Navarino, Codgrinton and de Rigny tried to negotiate with Ibrahim, but Ibrahim insisted that by the Sultan's order he must destroy Hydra. Codrington responded by saying that if Ibrahim's fleets attempted to go anywhere but home, he would have to destroy them. Ibrahim agreed to write to the Sultan to see if he would change his orders, but he also complained about the Greeks being able to continue their attacks. Codrington promised that he would stop the Greeks and Philhellenes from attacking the Turks and Egyptians. After doing this, he disbanded most of his fleet, which returned to Malta, while the French went to the Aegean.<ref name=\"Howarth233-34\"/>\n\nHowever, when [[Frank Abney Hastings|Frank Hastings]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]], destroyed a Turkish naval squadron during a [[Battle of Itea|raid off Itea]], Ibrahim sent a detachment of his fleet out of Navarino in order to defeat Hastings. Codrington had not heard of Hastings's actions and thought that Ibrahim was breaking his agreement. Codrington intercepted the force and made them retreat and did so again on the following day when Ibrahim led the fleet in person. Codrington assembled his fleet once more, with the British returning from Malta and the French from the Aegean. They were also joined by the Russian contingent led by Count Login Geiden. Ibrahim now began a campaign to annihilate the Greeks of the Peloponnese as he thought the Allies had reneged on their agreement.<ref name=\"Howarth236-37\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', pp. 236\u201337.</ref>\n\n[[File:Naval Battle of Navarino by Garneray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''The Naval [[Battle of Navarino]]'' by [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]] (1827).]]\n\nOn 20 October 1827, as the weather got worse, the British, Russian and French fleets entered the Bay of Navarino in peaceful formation to shelter themselves and to make sure that the Egyptian-Turkish fleet did not slip off and attack Hydra. When a British [[frigate]] sent a boat to request the Egyptians to move their fire ships, the officer on board was shot by the Egyptians. The frigate responded with musket fire in retaliation and an Egyptian ship fired a cannon shot at the French flagship, the Sirene, which returned fire.<ref name=\"Howarth239\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 239.</ref> A full engagement was begun which ended in a complete victory for the Allies and in the annihilation of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet.

The Porte demanded compensation from the Allies for the ships, but his demand was refused on the grounds that the Turks had acted as the aggressors. The three countries' ambassadors also left Constantinople.<ref name=\"Howarth241\">Howarth, ''The Greek Adventure'', p. 241.</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the battle was criticized as being an 'untoward event' towards Turkey, which was called an 'ancient ally'. Codrington was recalled and blamed for having allowed the retreating Egyptian-Turkish ships to carry 2,000 Greek slaves. In France, the news of the battle was greeted with great enthusiasm and the government had an unexpected surge in popularity. Russia formally took the opportunity to declare war on the Turks (April 1828).<ref name=\"Howarth241\"/>\n[[File:Entrevue du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Maison et d'Ibrahim Pacha, \u00e0 Navarin, septembre 1828.jpg|thumb|310x310px|''[[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] meeting [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in [[Pylos|Navarino]] in September 1828'' (by [[Jean-Charles Langlois]],1838, [[Palace of Versailles]]).]]\n\nIn October 1828, the Greeks regrouped and formed a new government under [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]]. Kapodistrias took advantage of the Russo-Turkish war and sent troops of the reorganised [[Hellenic Army]] to [[Central Greece]]. They advanced to seize as much territory as possible, including [[Athens]] and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. These Greek victories were proved decisive for the including of more territories in the future State. As far as the Peloponnese was concerned, Britain and Russia accepted the offer of France to send an army to expel Ibrahim's forces. [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]], who was given command of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary Corps]] of 15,000 men, landed on 30 August 1828 at [[Petalidi]] and helped the Greeks evacuate the Peloponnese from all the hostile troops by 30 October.

Greek forces under Demetrius Ypsilantis, for the first time trained to fight as a regular European army rather than as guerrilla bands, advanced against Aslan Bey's forces and defeated them. The Turks surrendered all lands from [[Livadeia]] to the [[Spercheios River]] in exchange for safe passage out of [[Central Greece]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], who took over as British Foreign Secretary, agreed to the Arta\u2013Volos borderline. However, the secret note on Crete, which the Bavarian plenipotentiary communicated to Britain, France and Russia, bore no fruit.\n\nIn May&nbsp;1832, Palmerston convened the [[London Conference of 1832|London Conference]]. The three Great Powers, Britain, [[July Monarchy|France]] and Russia, offered the throne to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarian]] prince, [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Wittelsbach]]; meanwhile, the [[Fifth National Assembly at Nafplion]] had approved the choice of Otto, and passed the Constitution of 1832 (which would come to be known as the \"Hegemonic Constitution\"). As co-guarantors of the monarchy, the Great Powers also agreed to guarantee a loan of 60&nbsp;million&nbsp;francs to the new king, empowering their ambassadors in the Ottoman capital to secure the end of the war. Under the protocol signed on May&nbsp;7, 1832 between Bavaria and the protecting powers, Greece was defined as a \"monarchical and independent state\" but was to pay an indemnity to the Porte.

There is debate among scholars over whether the massacres committed by the Greeks should be regarded as a response to prior events (such as the massacre of the Greeks of Tripoli, after the failed [[Orlov Revolt]] of 1770 and the destruction of the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]<ref>Booras, ''Hellenic Independence and America's Contribution to the Cause''. p. 24.<br />* Brewer, ''The Greek War of Independence'', p. 64.</ref>) or as separate atrocities, which started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt.<ref>Finlay, ''History of the Greek Revolution'', I, 171\u2013172<br />* Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 217<br />* St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 1\u20133, 12</ref>\n\nDuring the war, tens of thousands of Greek civilians were killed, left to die or taken into slavery.<ref>St. Clair, ''That Greece Might still Be Free'', pp. 80\u201381, 92</ref> Most of the Greeks in the Greek quarter of Constantinople were massacred.<ref>[[Fisher, H.A.L]], ''A History of Europe'', (Edward Arnold, London, 1936 & 1965) p. 882</ref> A large number of Christian clergymen were also killed, including the Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory V.{{cref|viii}}\n\nSometimes marked as allies of the Turks in the Peloponnese, Jewish settlements were also massacred by Greek revolutionaries; Steve Bowman argues that the tragedy may have been more a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South, where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews as such. Many Jews around Greece and throughout Europe were supporters of the Greek revolt, using their resources to loan substantial amounts to the newly formed Greek government. In turn, the success of the Greek Revolution was to stimulate the incipient stirrings of Jewish nationalism, later called [[Zionism]].<ref name=\"Rivlin\">Bowman, \"The Jews of Greece\", [http://www.umass.edu/judaic/anniversaryvolume/articles/30-F3-Bowman.pdf 421\u2013422] (PDF)</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Theodoros Vryzakis, Grateful Hellas (1858).jpg|thumb|left|upright|\"Grateful Hellas\" by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]\n\nThe consequences of the Greek revolution were somewhat ambiguous in the immediate aftermath. An independent Greek state had been established, but with Britain, Russia and France claiming a major role in Greek politics, an imported Bavarian dynast as ruler, and a mercenary army.<ref name=\"Jelavich229-34\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', pp.&nbsp;229\u201334.</ref> The country had been ravaged by ten years of fighting and was full of displaced refugees and empty Turkish estates, necessitating a series of land reforms over several decades.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nThe population of the new state numbered 800,000, representing less than one-third of the 2.5 million Greek inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. During a great part of the next century, the Greek state sought the liberation of the \"[[irredentism|unredeemed]]\" Greeks of the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the [[Megali Idea]], i.e., the goal of uniting all Greeks in one country.<ref name=\"Sowards\"/>\n\nAs a people, the Greeks no longer provided the princes for the Danubian Principalities, and were regarded within the Ottoman Empire, especially by the Muslim population, as traitors. [[Phanariotes]], who had until then held high office within the Ottoman Empire, were thenceforth regarded as suspect, and lost their special, privileged status. In Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire where Greek banking and merchant presence had been dominant, Armenians mostly replaced Greeks in banking, and Jewish merchants gained importance.<ref name=\"Jelavich229\">Jelavich, ''History of the Balkans'', p. 229</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Today the fatherland is reborn, that for so long was lost and extinguished.

For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically-based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Albanians]], [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians]] all subsequently fought for and won their independence.\n\nShortly after the war ended, the people of the Russian-dependent [[Congress Poland|Poland]], encouraged by the Greek victory, started the [[November Uprising]], hoping to regain their independence.

[[Rigas Feraios]] (1757 \u2013 1798) was a very prominent poet and intellectual of Greek independence. Many of his poems urged the people of Greece to leave the cities, head to the mountains where they would have more freedom, and unite to gain their independence.\n\n[[Dionysios Solomos]] (1798 \u2013 1857) was another national poet inspired by the Greek War of Independence. Solomos wrote the [[Hymn to Liberty]] in 1823, two years after the Greeks started the war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Hymn is 158 stanzas, making it one of the longest [[National Anthem]]s; however, officially, only the first two were adopted and sung. Not only is it the Greek anthem but also [[Cyprus]] adopted it as their own in 1966.\n\nTo this day, many songs are sung by Greeks worldwide on March 25 to [[Celebration of the Greek Revolution|celebrate their liberation]] and showcase their respect to the lives that were lost during the four hundred years Ottoman rule.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Music inspired by the Greek War of Independence\n!Song Name\n!Sung by\n!Released\n|-\n|'''Na'tane To 21'''\n\u039d\u03b1'\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03a4\u03bf 21\n|[[George Dalaras]]\n\u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\n|1970\n|-\n|'''O Thourios Tou Riga'''\n\u039f \u0398\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\n|[[Nikos Xilouris]]\n\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039e\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2\n|1797 (the poem)\n|-\n|'''Ola Ta Ethni Polemoun'''\n'\u039f\u03bb\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b1 \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\n|Rigas Feraios & Christos Leontis\n\n\u03a1\u03ae\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 & \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Saranta Palikaria'''\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\n|[[Stelios Kazantzidis]]\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b6\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|N/A\n|-\n|'''Perifanoi Oloi'''\n\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ae\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u0384\u039f\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\n|Paschalis Arvanitidis\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2\n|1967\n|-\n|'''Kleftiki Zoi'''\n\u039a\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u0396\u03c9\u03ae\n|[[Loukianos Kilaidonis]]\n\u039b\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b7\u03bb\u03b1\u03b7\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\n|1992\n|}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Evzones]]\n* [[Greek National Awakening]]\n* [[London Conference of 1832]]\n*[[Morea expedition|Morea Expedition (1828-1833)]]\n* [[Phoenix (currency)]]\n* [[Propylaea (Munich)]]\n* [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Cnote|i|Adanir refers to the \"mountainous districts such as [[Mani peninsula|Mani]] in the Peloponnese or [[Souliotes|Souli]] and [[Himara]] in Epirus, which had never been completely subjugated\".<ref>Adanir, \"Semi-autonomous Forces\", pp. 159\u2013160</ref>}}\n{{Cnote|ii|Re\u02bf\u00e2y\u00e2.

The words are \"physical\" because they have been \"laid onto videotape\"; Cockburn belongs to a generation of video artists who made videos rather than digital files, and \"it's clear that the material troubles him, why else imagine the turning wheels of the video cassette skinning him alive?

He describes a dream in which he was asked to read a [[eulogy]] for his father.\n\nWatching his father (Daniel Cockburn) in the home movie, he realizes that the gestures his father made are a kind of prison; he is forced to repeat them involuntarily. Then the man in black looks on with the horror of recognition, realizing that his father's [[body language]] \"prefigured all the gestures into which I would later grow, thinking they were my own.\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" />\n\nIn a dream, the man returns to his father's bedside. \"I had gone to visit him at the hospital, and he had been unconscious, but I thought he might like to hear the sound of my voice, so I spoke to him...\"<ref name=\"Hoolboom\" /> The man's father is on his [[wikt:deathbed|deathbed]]. Moments before his father dies, the man speaks to him, but his father makes no sign of hearing. The man pulls out an [[IV tube]] and speaks into it as though it were a microphone. His words turn into sharp needles that enter his father through the tube, who dies presently.

He is the [[protagonist]] of the [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', where he is portrayed by [[Scott Bakula]]. Archer also plays a major role in the formation of [[Starfleet]] and the [[United Federation of Planets]].\nArcher is the commanding officer of the first [[starship]] ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' (NX-01) from 2151 to 2161 and is later [[President (government title)|President]] of the [[United Federation of Planets]] from 2184 to 2192. According to a computer display in the episode \"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]\", historian [[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|John Gill]] considered Archer \"the greatest explorer of the 22nd century.\"\n\n==Biography==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Scott Bakula by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Actor [[Scott Bakula]] portrayed Archer.]] \nArcher, the son of famed [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp]] engineer Henry Archer and his wife Sally, was born in 2112 on 4 August  in [[Upstate New York]], where he spent most of his formative years; he later claimed to have spent the majority of his life in [[San Francisco]].<ref>Son of Henry Archer. [[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref><ref>Book preface about his father [[Singularity (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref>  The second-season episode \"First Flight\" depicted in flashback that he spent many years as a test pilot in the nascent Starfleet's NX program, based in San Francisco.  His dreams of exploring started as a boy. As a youth, Archer earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout Award]], along with 26 [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Merit Badge]]s, from the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. (Mentioned in the episode \"[[Rogue Planet (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Rogue Planet]]\".<ref>Boy scout and merit badges earned. [[Rogue Planet (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref>) He is an avid [[Water polo]] fan, often relaxing by watching water polo games.\n\nArcher grew up with a distrust of [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]s, perceiving them as having held back Humanity's progress, particularly with regard to his father's warp five project. As a [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|commander]], Archer served as a test pilot in the NX warp trials with A.G. Robinson, Duvall and Gardner. (All mentioned in the episode \"[[First Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)|First Flight]]\".<ref>Test pilot in NX warp trials and theft of NX-Beta. [[First Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref> It is assumed it is this Gardner who becomes [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Admiral]] when [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Maxwell Forrest|Maxwell Forrest]] dies in \"[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]\".<ref>Gardner (peer). Made Admiral after the death of Maxwell Forrest. [[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref>) Robinson pushed the limits of a test ship, the NX-Alpha, resulting in its destruction. The Vulcans recommended terminating the warp trials, which Starfleet agreed to, until [[Charles Tucker III]]<ref>Long time friend [[CharlesTucker III]]</ref> (who would later serve as chief engineer under Archer) fixed the intermix ratios and Archer and Robinson take the NX-Beta, the second test ship, without clearance to prove its readiness. Although Archer was suspended for the act, the program is halted for six months before it eventually resumes and the construction of the ''Enterprise'' begins.\n\n===Seasons 1 and 2===\nAs a man who loves to travel amongst the stars, Archer learns that being captain is a larger duty than [[management|manager]] and [[astronomer]]. He ran into species from all over the [[Galactic quadrant|quadrant]] trying to kill him and his crew. Encounters with the Mazarites, [[Tholian]]s, [[Suliban]] and [[Klingon]]s caused Archer to become more of a military commander.\n\nIn addition, Archer learns that the duties of captain include being a [[diplomat]]. During Seasons 1 and 2, he is somewhat uncomfortable with this role, especially in the episode \"[[A Night In Sickbay]]\" when [[#Porthos|Porthos]] contracts a deadly illness on an alien world.\n\nWhile exploring, Archer becomes an enemy of the Klingons. In a dispute with the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]] in 2152, he is convicted and sentenced to exile on [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country#Plot|Rura Penthe]], even though he is innocent of the charges and despite the Klingons having acknowledged his previous service to the Empire. With his escape, a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] is put on Archer's head and tensions with the Klingon Empire increase.\n\nAlso during this period, Archer has the distinction of making [[Earth in fiction|Earth]]'s official [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with dozens of [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] races, including the [[Andorian]]s, [[Fight or Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Axanar]], Suliban, [[Detained (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Tandarans]], [[Tellarite]]s, Tholians, [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] and [[Romulan]]s.\n\n===Temporal Cold War===\nAlthough initially optimistic, Archer becomes involved in his first mission as captain of ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' in the middle of the [[Temporal Cold War]]. The Temporal Cold War begins at the beginning of the pilot episode, \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\". In that episode, the audience is introduced to the [[Suliban]] and a mysterious being from the future (informally referred to as \"Future Guy\") who is guiding them.\n\nAs the Temporal Cold War continues, Archer also meets [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]], whose purpose seemingly is to safeguard Archer in particular and ''Enterprise'' in general. Daniels' comments are that Archer will be the man who helps to form the [[United Federation of Planets]], and it becomes apparent by the third season that Daniels is representing the Federation throughout the Temporal Cold War.\n\n===Season 3===\nIn Season 3, he was the Military commander in the Expanse. Following the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] attack on [[Earth in fiction|Earth]] in 2153, Archer becomes a changed man. No longer a congenial captain, he is now driven and determined to seek out and confront the perpetrators. Archer commits desperate, controversial acts of questionable morality to ensure a future for Earth, including [[Anomaly (Star Trek: Enterprise)|torturing a prisoner]], [[Similitude (Star Trek: Enterprise)|cloning Tucker]] to harvest body parts in order to save the chief engineer and thus killing the clone, and [[Damage (Star Trek: Enterprise)|stealing a vital warp coil]] and leaving a ship of aliens stranded in space.\n\nWhile on his mission to locate the Xindi, Archer is briefly [[Extinction (Star Trek: Enterprise)|transformed]] into a member of the extinct Loque'eque by a mutagenic [[virus]]. Later, he is infected by [[subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] [[Parasitism|parasite]]s, creating an [[Twilight (Star Trek: Enterprise)|alternate timeline]] in which the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'''s mission fails and the Xindi succeed in destroying Earth (although the nature of these parasites mean that this timeline is erased when Phlox's cure for Archer erases the parasites themselves from history). With the help of [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]], Archer, along with [[T'Pol]], [[Carpenter Street (Star Trek: Enterprise)|travels back in time]] to the year 2004 to prevent the release of a Xindi-Reptilian [[biological warfare|bio-weapon]].\n\nBy the end of the season, Archer is [[Zero Hour (Star Trek: Enterprise)|presumed dead]] when the Xindi superweapon is destroyed, after having convinced three of the five Xindi races that reports of humanity's future conflict with them are wrong. However, in reality, he is transported back to the early 1940s during [[World War II]], as is the ''Enterprise''.\n\n===Season 4===\nAfter returning home in 2154, Archer helps a faction of [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] fight an oppressive government on their planet. During this incident, he is the recipient of the ''[[Katra (Star Trek)|katra]]'', or living spirit, of the great Vulcan philosopher [[Surak]]. The ''katra'' is later transferred to a Vulcan priest, and Archer is left unharmed. This leads to the reformation of Vulcan society, and explains why the Vulcans of Archer's time were so different from the Vulcans of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk's]] time. In the process, Archer becomes the first known Human participant in a Vulcan [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]]. Since that experience, he has used that knowledge at least once: To assist [[T'Pol]] with conducting her first mind meld in order to gain information about who kidnapped [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr. Phlox]] (the episode \"[[Affliction (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Affliction]]\").\n\nArcher is also involved in one of the first, and possibly most significant, treaties yet, being asked to escort Gral, the [[Tellarite]] ambassador, to the Tellarite-[[Andorian]] negotiations. En route, he and his crew run into the Andorian [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Thy'lek Shran|Shran]], a long-time friend/enemy/ally. During Shran's stay, [[Romulan]]s attack and cause the fragile alliance to crash to a halt. In the mix-up, a Tellarite kills Shran's lover [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Talas|Talas]], and Shran avenges her death by demanding the Tellarite who killed her to fight to the death. In an attempt to protect the fragile peace treaty, Archer takes the challenge instead and Shran is incapacitated. The alliance remains intact, and soon evolves into the [[United Federation of Planets]]. (\"[[Babel One]]\", \"[[United (Star Trek: Enterprise)|United]]\", \"[[The Aenar]]\", \"[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]\", \"[[Terra Prime]]\", \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\").\n\n===Place in history===\nThe time traveler [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]] revealed that Archer would eventually have a major role in the founding of the [[United Federation of Planets]] in 2161. He briefly took Archer ahead in time to the point where Archer is about to sign the Federation accords on [[Earth in fiction|Earth]], expanded further in the series finale.\n\nArcher's fate is revealed in the episode \"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]] Part II\" when a computer information screen aboard the 23rd century [[Starfleet]] vessel USS ''Defiant'' is briefly visible. According to the computer profile, Archer was an [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Admiral]] and Chief of Staff at [[Starfleet|Starfleet Command]] at the time of his retirement. He later went on to serve as [[ambassador]] to [[Andorian|Andoria]] from 2165 to 2175. From 2175 to 2183, Archer served as a member of the Federation Council, followed by eight years as Federation [[President (government title)|President]] (2184\u20132192). He was also an honorary member of the Andorian Imperial Guard. Historian [[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|John Gill]] considered Archer \"the greatest explorer of the 22nd century.\" The same computer display states that Archer's Planet and Archer IV (mentioned in \"[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]\" and \"[[Strange New World (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Strange New World]]\" respectively) were named after him.\n\nUnused artwork would have shown that Archer dies peacefully in his sleep at his home in [[Upstate New York]] in 2245, exactly one day after he attends the commissioning ceremony of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701)]]. However, this computer display gave 2160 as the year Archer's captaincy of ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' came to an end, which was officially set as 2161 in \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\".\n\nAt least two starships were named for him: the ''Archer''-class scout ship featured in the tie-in novel series ''[[Star Trek: Vanguard]]'' and its follow-up ''Star Trek: Seekers'', and an unspecified ship alluded to in ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.\n\nThe 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film briefly references Archer, as [[Montgomery Scott]] receives punishment stemming from an incident involving a [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] and \"Admiral Archer's prized Beagle.\" There was some confusion as to if this actually referred to Jonathan Archer himself as this would make him 141 years old. Star Trek writer Bob Orci went on record to clear up the issue, \"Admiral Archer is a reference to the Archer we all know and love, and yes he would be over 100, which is a likely life expectancy in a futuristic space faring race of humans (as depicted by McCoy\u2019s ([[DeForest Kelley]], playing the 137 year old Admiral) appearance in ''The Next Generation''.)\" <ref>[http://trekmovie.com/2009/05/18/orci-kurtzman-to-answer-fan-questions-at-trekmovie-transcript-of-last-weeks-impromptu-qa/#1828678 TrekMovie.com transcript]</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"[[Choose Your Pain]]\", Archer is shown listed on the Starfleet Database as one of Starfleet's most decorated Captains as of 2256. Also included in the list are: Robert April, Matthew Decker, Philippa Georgiou, and [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]].\n\n===Porthos===\n'''Porthos''' is Archer's pet [[dog]]. One of four males born in a litter of [[England|English]] [[Beagle]]s, Porthos and his brothers, Athos, Aramis and d'Artagnan, were named after characters from ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re]]. He has been Archer's faithful companion since the age of six weeks, and has remained so for the duration of Archer's 10-year assignment as [[Starfleet ranks and insignia#Captain|captain]] of ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]''.\n\nPorthos was portrayed by a male beagle named Prada in Season 1. Afterwards, he was played by a further two female beagles, Breezy and Windy, although the character of Porthos remained male.\n\nArcher would occasionally leave Porthos in the care of [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr. Phlox]] when he was away or otherwise unavailable.\n\nArcher cares very much for Porthos. In the [[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|pilot episode]], [[Travis Mayweather]] says Archer won't use the [[transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] for himself and certainly not for his dog. In \"[[A Night In Sickbay]]\", Porthos nearly dies when he contracts a deadly [[pathogen]] on the [[Kreetassan]] homeworld, but is saved when Phlox [[organ transplant|transplants]] a gland from a [[chameleon]]-like creature.\n\nIn Season 3 Episode 10 Archer explains in answer to the question \"Can he do any tricks?\" that \"I haven\u2019t taught him any, mostly what he does is eat, sleep and not fetch.\" He also commented \u201cthere\u2019s nothing Porthos likes more than dinner time\".\n\nAlthough Porthos isn't the first domesticated pet to be featured in a ''[[Star Trek]]'' series ([[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] owned a cat, [[Data (Star Trek)#Spot|Spot]], in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and Captain Jean-Luc Picard owned a [[Pterois volitans|lionfish]] named Livingston), Porthos has the distinction of being the first pet to maintain an ongoing presence in the series, and even \u2013 as illustrated above \u2013 become the focus of an episode.\n\nIn the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]] depicted in \"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]\", Porthos is a [[Rottweiler]]. According to the episode's [[podcast]] on [[Star Trek#External links|Startrek.com]], the dog that portrayed the mirror Porthos was known on set as an even bigger \"baby\" than the dogs which have played the regular Porthos. Episode writer [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]] noted that the animal was \"The sweetest dog I have ever met.\"\n\nIn the episode \"[[Acquisition (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Acquisition]]\", Porthos was interrogated by a group of [[Ferengi]] pirates while the rest of the crew were incapacitated, but the aliens' [[universal translator]] could not decipher his barking. The pirates didn't know what to make of the dog, even speculating that he was perhaps food. They then decided they could sell him to a zoo.\n\nIn the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, it is implied that \"Admiral Archer's\" prized Beagle was involved in a freak accident when [[Montgomery Scott]] used him as a test subject for a transporter experiment. However, Porthos would have been over 70 years old when Scott was born, therefore it is not at all certain whether or not the beagle in question was Porthos, although it is possible that it has been made possible for dogs to live longer by that time; it's also possible that Archer only kept beagles for pets. The more likely scenario, however, is that ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' was an atrocious film and J.J. Abrams couldn't direct a funeral. The novelization of the film - eventually - has the beagle transported onto the Enterprise.\n\n==Mirror Universe==\nIn the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], '''Jonathan Archer''' was [[executive officer|first officer]] of the [[Enterprise (NX-01)#Mirror Universe|ISS ''Enterprise'']] with the rank of [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Commander]]. In this universe, he served under the command of [[Starfleet ranks and insignia#Captain|Captain]] [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Maxwell Forrest|Maximilian Forrest]], the alternate version of [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Admiral]] [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Maxwell Forrest|Maxwell Forrest]]. Unlike in the \"normal\" ''[[Star Trek|Trek]]'' universe, where Forrest and Archer are close friends, the mirror versions of the characters did not get along well at all.\n\nLike most characters in the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Terran Empire]], the mirror Archer was treacherous, cunning and scheming. He led a [[mutiny]] against Forrest and took over ''Enterprise''. However, with the help of [[T'Pol]] and other [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]s, Forrest was freed and retook the ship. Archer surrendered, but had locked the ship's navigation controls so its heading could not be altered. His reason for the mutiny was brought to light as he had been informed about a ship that seemed to be from another dimension. With the ship's course unable to be changed and [[Starfleet]] now intrigued by what Archer had become aware of, Forrest was ordered to investigate, he also had Archer punished in the Agony Booth for a then record of ten hours, giving the Commander only one hour to clean up and get ready for a staff meeting after his release. On arrival, they discovered the USS ''Defiant'', a [[Starfleet]] ship from 100 years into the future of the \"normal\" universe.\n\nArcher led an [[away team (Star Trek term)|away team]] to take control of the ''Defiant'' while the ''Enterprise'' was destroyed by the [[Tholian]]s. He and his team, plus survivors from the ''Enterprise'', discovered the ''Defiant'' was not only from another dimension, but the future and that the alternate dimension never had a Terran Empire. After successfully crushing a rebellion against the Empire, Archer attempted to take the futuristic vessel to [[Earth in fiction|Earth]] where he would proclaim himself [[Emperor]]. However, before he could do so, he was killed by his universe's [[Hoshi Sato]], who poisoned him, took the ship and claimed the Terran throne for herself.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2019, Vulture ranked Captain Archer as the 8th ''Star Trek'' captain by their selection criterion, a combination of competency and managerial style.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-star-trek-captains-ranked.html|website=www.vulture.com|title=Which Star Trek Captain Has the Best Managerial Technique?|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> They note Archer as being interested in exploration, but also having a relaxed attitude and that he also enjoys spending times with friends and his pet dog.<ref name=\":0\" /> Space.com rated Archer as the sixth best captain of ''Star Trek''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/38244-best-star-trek-captains.html|title=6 'Star Trek' Captains, Ranked from Worst to Best|last=Entertainment|first=Elizabeth Howell 2017-09-22T21:09:10Z|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> The Washington Post ranked Archer as the seventh best Captain of ''Star Trek''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/09/26/ultimate-ranking-best-star-trek-captains/|title=The ultimate ranking of the best \"Star Trek\" captains|last=Post {{!}}|first=Special to The Washington|date=2017-09-26|website=The Denver Post|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/09/22/the-ultimate-ranking-of-the-best-star-trek-captains/?noredirect=on The Washington Post -

He is the [[protagonist]] of the [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', where he is portrayed by [[Scott Bakula]]. Archer also plays a major role in the formation of [[Starfleet]] and the [[United Federation of Planets]].\nArcher is the commanding officer of the first [[starship]] ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' (NX-01) from 2151 to 2161 and is later [[President (government title)|President]] of the [[United Federation of Planets]] from 2184 to 2192. According to a computer display in the episode \"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]\", historian [[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|John Gill]] considered Archer \"the greatest explorer of the 22nd century.\"\n\n==Biography==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Scott Bakula by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Actor [[Scott Bakula]] portrayed Archer.]] \nArcher, the son of famed [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp]] engineer Henry Archer and his wife Sally, was born in 2112 on 4 August  in [[Upstate New York]], where he spent most of his formative years; he later claimed to have spent the majority of his life in [[San Francisco]].<ref>Son of Henry Archer. [[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref><ref>Book preface about his father [[Singularity (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref>  The second-season episode \"First Flight\" depicted in flashback that he spent many years as a test pilot in the nascent Starfleet's NX program, based in San Francisco.  His dreams of exploring started as a boy. As a youth, Archer earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout Award]], along with 26 [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Merit Badge]]s, from the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. (Mentioned in the episode \"[[Rogue Planet (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Rogue Planet]]\".<ref>Boy scout and merit badges earned. [[Rogue Planet (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref>) He is an avid [[Water polo]] fan, often relaxing by watching water polo games.\n\nArcher grew up with a distrust of [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]s, perceiving them as having held back Humanity's progress, particularly with regard to his father's warp five project. As a [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|commander]], Archer served as a test pilot in the NX warp trials with A.G. Robinson, Duvall and Gardner. (All mentioned in the episode \"[[First Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)|First Flight]]\".<ref>Test pilot in NX warp trials and theft of NX-Beta. [[First Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref> It is assumed it is this Gardner who becomes [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Admiral]] when [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Maxwell Forrest|Maxwell Forrest]] dies in \"[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]\".<ref>Gardner (peer). Made Admiral after the death of Maxwell Forrest. [[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)]]</ref>) Robinson pushed the limits of a test ship, the NX-Alpha, resulting in its destruction. The Vulcans recommended terminating the warp trials, which Starfleet agreed to, until [[Charles Tucker III]]<ref>Long time friend [[CharlesTucker III]]</ref> (who would later serve as chief engineer under Archer) fixed the intermix ratios and Archer and Robinson take the NX-Beta, the second test ship, without clearance to prove its readiness. Although Archer was suspended for the act, the program is halted for six months before it eventually resumes and the construction of the ''Enterprise'' begins.\n\n===Seasons 1 and 2===\nAs a man who loves to travel amongst the stars, Archer learns that being captain is a larger duty than [[management|manager]] and [[astronomer]]. He ran into species from all over the [[Galactic quadrant|quadrant]] trying to kill him and his crew. Encounters with the Mazarites, [[Tholian]]s, [[Suliban]] and [[Klingon]]s caused Archer to become more of a military commander.\n\nIn addition, Archer learns that the duties of captain include being a [[diplomat]]. During Seasons 1 and 2, he is somewhat uncomfortable with this role, especially in the episode \"[[A Night In Sickbay]]\" when [[#Porthos|Porthos]] contracts a deadly illness on an alien world.\n\nWhile exploring, Archer becomes an enemy of the Klingons. In a dispute with the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]] in 2152, he is convicted and sentenced to exile on [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country#Plot|Rura Penthe]], even though he is innocent of the charges and despite the Klingons having acknowledged his previous service to the Empire. With his escape, a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] is put on Archer's head and tensions with the Klingon Empire increase.\n\nAlso during this period, Archer has the distinction of making [[Earth in fiction|Earth]]'s official [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with dozens of [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] races, including the [[Andorian]]s, [[Fight or Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Axanar]], Suliban, [[Detained (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Tandarans]], [[Tellarite]]s, Tholians, [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] and [[Romulan]]s.\n\n===Temporal Cold War===\nAlthough initially optimistic, Archer becomes involved in his first mission as captain of ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' in the middle of the [[Temporal Cold War]]. The Temporal Cold War begins at the beginning of the pilot episode, \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\". In that episode, the audience is introduced to the [[Suliban]] and a mysterious being from the future (informally referred to as \"Future Guy\") who is guiding them.\n\nAs the Temporal Cold War continues, Archer also meets [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]], whose purpose seemingly is to safeguard Archer in particular and ''Enterprise'' in general. Daniels' comments are that Archer will be the man who helps to form the [[United Federation of Planets]], and it becomes apparent by the third season that Daniels is representing the Federation throughout the Temporal Cold War.\n\n===Season 3===\nIn Season 3, he was the Military commander in the Expanse. Following the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] attack on [[Earth in fiction|Earth]] in 2153, Archer becomes a changed man. No longer a congenial captain, he is now driven and determined to seek out and confront the perpetrators. Archer commits desperate, controversial acts of questionable morality to ensure a future for Earth, including [[Anomaly (Star Trek: Enterprise)|torturing a prisoner]], [[Similitude (Star Trek: Enterprise)|cloning Tucker]] to harvest body parts in order to save the chief engineer and thus killing the clone, and [[Damage (Star Trek: Enterprise)|stealing a vital warp coil]] and leaving a ship of aliens stranded in space.\n\nWhile on his mission to locate the Xindi, Archer is briefly [[Extinction (Star Trek: Enterprise)|transformed]] into a member of the extinct Loque'eque by a mutagenic [[virus]]. Later, he is infected by [[subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]] [[Parasitism|parasite]]s, creating an [[Twilight (Star Trek: Enterprise)|alternate timeline]] in which the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'''s mission fails and the Xindi succeed in destroying Earth (although the nature of these parasites mean that this timeline is erased when Phlox's cure for Archer erases the parasites themselves from history). With the help of [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]], Archer, along with [[T'Pol]], [[Carpenter Street (Star Trek: Enterprise)|travels back in time]] to the year 2004 to prevent the release of a Xindi-Reptilian [[biological warfare|bio-weapon]].\n\nBy the end of the season, Archer is [[Zero Hour (Star Trek: Enterprise)|presumed dead]] when the Xindi superweapon is destroyed, after having convinced three of the five Xindi races that reports of humanity's future conflict with them are wrong. However, in reality, he is transported back to the early 1940s during [[World War II]], as is the ''Enterprise''.\n\n===Season 4===\nAfter returning home in 2154, Archer helps a faction of [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] fight an oppressive government on their planet. During this incident, he is the recipient of the ''[[Katra (Star Trek)|katra]]'', or living spirit, of the great Vulcan philosopher [[Surak]]. The ''katra'' is later transferred to a Vulcan priest, and Archer is left unharmed. This leads to the reformation of Vulcan society, and explains why the Vulcans of Archer's time were so different from the Vulcans of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk's]] time. In the process, Archer becomes the first known Human participant in a Vulcan [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]]. Since that experience, he has used that knowledge at least once: To assist [[T'Pol]] with conducting her first mind meld in order to gain information about who kidnapped [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Dr. Phlox]] (the episode \"[[Affliction (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Affliction]]\").\n\nArcher is also involved in one of the first, and possibly most significant, treaties yet, being asked to escort Gral, the [[Tellarite]] ambassador, to the Tellarite-[[Andorian]] negotiations. En route, he and his crew run into the Andorian [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Thy'lek Shran|Shran]], a long-time friend/enemy/ally. During Shran's stay, [[Romulan]]s attack and cause the fragile alliance to crash to a halt. In the mix-up, a Tellarite kills Shran's lover [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Talas|Talas]], and Shran avenges her death by demanding the Tellarite who killed her to fight to the death. In an attempt to protect the fragile peace treaty, Archer takes the challenge instead and Shran is incapacitated. The alliance remains intact, and soon evolves into the [[United Federation of Planets]]. (\"[[Babel One]]\", \"[[United (Star Trek: Enterprise)|United]]\", \"[[The Aenar]]\", \"[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]\", \"[[Terra Prime]]\", \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\").\n\n===Place in history===\nThe time traveler [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Daniels|Daniels]] revealed that Archer would eventually have a major role in the founding of the [[United Federation of Planets]] in 2161. He briefly took Archer ahead in time to the point where Archer is about to sign the Federation accords on [[Earth in fiction|Earth]], expanded further in the series finale.\n\nArcher's fate is revealed in the episode \"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]] Part II\" when a computer information screen aboard the 23rd century [[Starfleet]] vessel USS ''Defiant'' is briefly visible. According to the computer profile, Archer was an [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Admiral]] and Chief of Staff at [[Starfleet|Starfleet Command]] at the time of his retirement. He later went on to serve as [[ambassador]] to [[Andorian|Andoria]] from 2165 to 2175. From 2175 to 2183, Archer served as a member of the Federation Council, followed by eight years as Federation [[President (government title)|President]] (2184\u20132192). He was also an honorary member of the Andorian Imperial Guard. Historian [[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|John Gill]] considered Archer \"the greatest explorer of the 22nd century.\" The same computer display states that Archer's Planet and Archer IV (mentioned in \"[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]\" and \"[[Strange New World (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Strange New World]]\" respectively) were named after him.\n\nUnused artwork would have shown that Archer dies peacefully in his sleep at his home in [[Upstate New York]] in 2245, exactly one day after he attends the commissioning ceremony of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701)]]. However, this computer display gave 2160 as the year Archer's captaincy of ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' came to an end, which was officially set as 2161 in \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\".\n\nAt least two starships were named for him: the ''Archer''-class scout ship featured in the tie-in novel series ''[[Star Trek: Vanguard]]'' and its follow-up ''Star Trek: Seekers'', and an unspecified ship alluded to in ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''.\n\nThe 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film briefly references Archer, as [[Montgomery Scott]] receives punishment stemming from an incident involving a [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] and \"Admiral Archer's prized Beagle.\" There was some confusion as to if this actually referred to Jonathan Archer himself as this would make him 141 years old. Star Trek writer Bob Orci went on record to clear up the issue, \"Admiral Archer is a reference to the Archer we all know and love, and yes he would be over 100, which is a likely life expectancy in a futuristic space faring race of humans (as depicted by McCoy\u2019s ([[DeForest Kelley]], playing the 137 year old Admiral) appearance in ''The Next Generation''.)\" <ref>[http://trekmovie.com/2009/05/18/orci-kurtzman-to-answer-fan-questions-at-trekmovie-transcript-of-last-weeks-impromptu-qa/#1828678 TrekMovie.com transcript]</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' episode \"[[Choose Your Pain]]\", Archer is shown listed on the Starfleet Database as one of Starfleet's most decorated Captains as of 2256.

In this universe, he served under the command of [[Starfleet ranks and insignia#Captain|Captain]] [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Maxwell Forrest|Maximilian Forrest]], the alternate version of [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Admiral]] [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Maxwell Forrest|Maxwell Forrest]]. Unlike in the \"normal\" ''[[Star Trek|Trek]]'' universe, where Forrest and Archer are close friends, the mirror versions of the characters did not get along well at all.\n\nLike most characters in the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Terran Empire]], the mirror Archer was treacherous, cunning and scheming. He led a [[mutiny]] against Forrest and took over ''Enterprise''. However, with the help of [[T'Pol]] and other [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]]s, Forrest was freed and retook the ship. Archer surrendered, but had locked the ship's navigation controls so its heading could not be altered. His reason for the mutiny was brought to light as he had been informed about a ship that seemed to be from another dimension. With the ship's course unable to be changed and [[Starfleet]] now intrigued by what Archer had become aware of, Forrest was ordered to investigate, he also had Archer punished in the Agony Booth for a then record of ten hours, giving the Commander only one hour to clean up and get ready for a staff meeting after his release. On arrival, they discovered the USS ''Defiant'', a [[Starfleet]] ship from 100 years into the future of the \"normal\" universe.\n\nArcher led an [[away team (Star Trek term)|away team]] to take control of the ''Defiant'' while the ''Enterprise'' was destroyed by the [[Tholian]]s. He and his team, plus survivors from the ''Enterprise'', discovered the ''Defiant'' was not only from another dimension, but the future and that the alternate dimension never had a Terran Empire. After successfully crushing a rebellion against the Empire, Archer attempted to take the futuristic vessel to [[Earth in fiction|Earth]] where he would proclaim himself [[Emperor]]. However, before he could do so, he was killed by his universe's [[Hoshi Sato]], who poisoned him, took the ship and claimed the Terran throne for herself.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2019, Vulture ranked Captain Archer as the 8th ''Star Trek'' captain by their selection criterion, a combination of competency and managerial style.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-star-trek-captains-ranked.html|website=www.vulture.com|title=Which Star Trek Captain Has the Best Managerial Technique?|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> They note Archer as being interested in exploration, but also having a relaxed attitude and that he also enjoys spending times with friends and his pet dog.<ref name=\":0\" /> Space.com rated Archer as the sixth best captain of ''Star Trek''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/38244-best-star-trek-captains.html|title=6 'Star Trek' Captains, Ranked from Worst to Best|last=Entertainment|first=Elizabeth Howell 2017-09-22T21:09:10Z|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> The Washington Post ranked Archer as the seventh best Captain of ''Star Trek''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/09/26/ultimate-ranking-best-star-trek-captains/|title=The ultimate ranking of the best \"Star Trek\" captains|last=Post {{!}}|first=Special to The Washington|date=2017-09-26|website=The Denver Post|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/09/22/the-ultimate-ranking-of-the-best-star-trek-captains/?noredirect=on The Washington Post - The ultimate ranking of the best \u2018Star Trek\u2019 captains]</ref>\n\nScreenRant rated Archer as the fourth best captain, noting that he had to pioneer space without the benefit of the institutions he helped to create, and noted his ability to take on challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/star-trek-captains-best-worst/|title=Star Trek: The 13 Most Amazing Captains (And 12 Who Should've Never Had Command)|date=2018-09-23|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref> CBR ranked archer as the 5th best member of [[Starfleet]] 2018, in between [[Spock]] (#6) and [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] (#4) in their ranking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-starfleet-members-ranked/|title=Star Trek: The 25 Best Members Of Starfleet, Ranked|date=2018-10-27|website=CBR|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, The Wrap ranked Archer as the 29th best main cast character of ''Star Trek'' overall.<ref>[https://www.thewrap.com/all-39-star-trek-main-characters-ranked-from-spock-to-wesley-photos/]</ref> In 2016, Captain Archer was ranked as the 9th most important character of [[Starfleet]] within the ''Star Trek'' science fiction universe by [[Wired magazine]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/star-treks-100-crew-members-ranked/|title=Star Trek's 100 Most Important Crew Members, Ranked|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=2016-09-05|work=Wired|access-date=2019-03-20|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction|Television|Politics}}\n* [[List of Star Trek characters#Star Trek: Enterprise|List of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Memory Alpha}}\n{{Memory Alpha|Jonathan Archer (mirror)}}\n* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/ENT/character/1122628.html STARTREK.COM: Jonathan Archer]\n* [https://twitter.com/_MichaelSussman/status/900853960289918976 Production artwork showing Archer's biography], from ''In A Mirror, Darkly''\n\n{{Star Trek ships named Enterprise}}\n{{Star Trek: Enterprise}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Archer, Jonathan}}\n[[Category:Star Trek: Enterprise characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Fictional aviators]]\n[[Category:Fictional councillors]]\n[[Category:Fictional ambassadors]]\n[[Category:Fictional diplomats]]\n[[Category:Fictional presidents]]\n[[Category:Starfleet admirals]]\n[[Category:Starfleet captains]]\n[[Category:Starfleet commanders]]\n[[Category:Starfleet officers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2001]]\n", "name_user": "194.125.105.126", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePorthos)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Archer"}

The project uses Deep Thunder to predict the weather at an unprecedented 333 m resolution, simulating complex airflow patterns over the lake that are crucial to lake currents and nutrient cycling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jefferson Project at Lake George|url=https://jeffersonproject.rpi.edu/|work=Rensselaer|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== New York ===\n[[New York City]] was the first city to test a full scale implementation of Deep Thunder. IBM is experimenting with using a mobile app to distribute location-specific predictions and to issue alerts. Data from the app can be used by maintenance crews to determine if wind levels are too high to work, or it could be used to get a weather forecast at a certain address.<ref name=\"arstech\"/>\n\n=== Rio de Janeiro ===\nIBM is currently expanding the project to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in order to predict floods, and anticipate where storms might trigger mudslides. The city is collaborating with IBM on a multimillion-dollar plan to improve emergency responsiveness, by providing comprehensive information about rainfall estimates, wind speed and direction, probabilities of landslides and floods to responders.

The theme park is divided into four sections that celebrate [[Christmas]], [[Halloween]], [[Thanksgiving]] and the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] with rides, live entertainment, games, and attractions.\n\nHoliday World contains three [[wooden roller coaster]]s: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], and [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], as well as [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]] (a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] launched [[Wing Coaster]]) and [[The Howler]]. The safari-themed water park includes the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and Guinness World Record Holder [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], numerous family raft rides and [[water slide]]s, two [[wave pool]]s, junior-sized wave pool, two children's-sized water slide areas, a [[lazy river]], two family \"tipping bucket\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:FreedomTrain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Freedom Train, previously called the Santa Claus Land Railroad, operated from 1946 to 2012]]\n\n===Santa Claus Land===\n\n====Construction====\nPlans for what would become '''Santa Claus Land''', and later '''Holiday World & Splashin' Safari''', were first conceived as a retirement project by Louis J. Koch, a retired industrialist from [[Evansville, Indiana]]. In 1941, Koch visited the town of [[Santa Claus, Indiana]]. A family man and father of nine children, it bothered him that children traveled to the town only to be disappointed when they discovered [[Santa Claus]] was not there. In response, Koch developed the idea for a park where children could have fun and visit Santa year-round. Although initial construction plans were delayed by [[World War II]], construction of Santa Claus Land eventually began on August 4, 1945.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|title=Park History|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-history-santa-claus-land-holiday-world|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/timeline-santa-claus-land-holiday-world-splashin-safari|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> At this time, [[Indiana]] had only one [[amusement park]] which was [[Indiana Beach]] (at the time called Ideal Beach) that had opened in 1926, 20 years before Santa Claus Land opened.\n\n====Opening to 1954====\nSanta Claus Land opened on August 3, 1946. At no cost, the park offered a Santa, a toy shop, toy displays, a restaurant and themed children's rides, one of which was The Freedom Train. After overcoming doubts about the park's ability for success, Louis Koch's son, [[William A. Koch|William A. \"Bill\" Koch, Sr.]], took over as head of Santa Claus Land. In the following years, Bill Koch continued to add to the park, including the first Jeep-Go-Round ever manufactured, a new restaurant and a deer farm which was eventually home to fourteen [[Fallow deer|European white fallow deer]].<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"deer\">{{cite web|title=Holiblog|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029220227/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|archive-date=October 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reagan1955.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Future President Ronald Reagan visited in 1955]]\n\n====1955 to 1975====\n[[File:SantaClausLand Aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An aerial view of Santa Claus Land taken around 1957]]\nBeginning in 1955, Santa Claus Land charged admission for the first time; adults were charged 50 cents while children continued to be admitted for free. Despite the new cost of admission, attendance continued to grow with the park. The Pleasureland ride section, which exists today as Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch, debuted in 1955. In the early 1970s, additional children's rides, including Dasher's Seahorses, Comet's Rockets, Blitzen's Airplanes, and Prancer's Merry-Go-Round, were added to this section. From 1959 to 1961, the first live entertainment, the Willie Bartley [[waterskiing|Water Ski]] Thrill Show, performed on Lake Rudolph each summer. A Santa Claus Choir composed of local children also performed at the park in 1970 and 1971.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIn 1960, Bill Koch married Patricia \"Pat\" Yellig, the daughter of Jim Yellig, the park's Santa Claus. Bill and Pat Koch would have five children: Will, Kristi, Daniel, Philip, and Natalie.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n====1976 to 1983====\nIn 1976, Santa Claus Land shifted its focus, along with its entrance, which was moved from [[Indiana State Road 162|State Road 162]] to its present location on [[Indiana State Road 245|State Road 245]]. The park began to focus on the entire family, rather than just children. The park added nine new rides by 1984, eight of which they hoped would appeal to older children and adults alike. Eagle's Flight, Rough Riders, Roundhouse, Virginia Reel, Scarecrow Scrambler, Lewis & Clark Trail, Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay were all targeted towards families, while Dancer's Thunder Bumpers Junior was built for children who weren't quite ready for the larger version of the ride.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n===Holiday World===\n[[File:FrightfulFalls.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early photo of Frightful Falls showing what it looked like prior to the construction of [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]] in this area]]\n\n====1984 to 1992====\nBy 1984, the Koch Family had realized the theming possibilities beyond [[Christmas]]. Santa Claus Land soon saw the first major expansion in park history with the addition of a [[Halloween]] section and a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] section. With the inclusion of more than just Christmas, '''Santa Claus Land''' formally changed its name to '''Holiday World'''. In the following years, Frightful Falls and Banshee were added to the Halloween section, Raging Rapids was added to the Fourth of July section in 1990, and Kringle's Kaf\u00e9 restaurant was built in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIt was also during this time period that Holiday World saw a change in leadership. Will Koch, the eldest of Bill Koch's children, took over as President of the park. Another of Bill Koch's children, Daniel \"Dan\" Koch, became chairman of the board.<ref name=\"patriarch\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World's Patriarch|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-patriarch-leaves-legacy|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Holiday World & Splashin' Safari===\n[[File:TheRaven.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An early photo of The Raven.

In its first year of operation, Splashin' Safari operated with Congo River, Crocodile Isle, AmaZOOM and Bamboo Chute. The Wave was added the following year.\n\nThe park added the first of its three [[wooden roller coaster]]s in 1995 with [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], built by [[Custom Coasters International]]. The Raven was named \"Ride of the Year\" and was voted as the world's second best wooden roller coaster. In 2000, The Raven was ranked as the #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by [[Amusement Today]] magazine. It held the top spot for a total of four years.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> As of the 2011 awards, The Raven has remained ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world.<ref name=\"gta\">{{cite web|title=2011 Golden Ticket Awards |url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |publisher=Amusement Today |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025513/http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years, the park made only two additions. The first was the addition of Monsoon Lagoon in Splashin' Safari. The second was the replacement of Firecracker with Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring Holidog's Treehouse, The Howler, Doggone Trail and Magic Waters.\n\n[[File:Zinga.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Zinga]]\n\nIn 2000, Custom Coasters International added another wooden roller coaster. [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], based on [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\", was opened immediately adjacent to The Raven and is taller, longer, and faster than The Raven. The Legend's ranking reached its peak in 2002, when it was voted the fourth best wooden roller coaster in the world.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Much like The Raven, The Legend continues to be ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world, as of the 2011 awards.<ref name=\"gta\" /> In 2000, the park also began offering its guests free unlimited soft drinks, a service which brought international attention to the park.<ref name=\"drinks\">{{cite web|title=Free Drinks Wins Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-free-drinks-wins-international-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Holiday World was the first park in the world to offer this service to its guests.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nFor the next five years, the park's additions grew steadily. In 2002, ZOOMbabwe, the world's largest enclosed water slide, was added to Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"zoombabwe\">{{cite web|title=ZOOMbabwe|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/zoombabwe|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2003, Splashin' Safari added Zinga on top of The Legend's spiral drop, a [[ProSlide Tornado]], while Holiday World replaced Banshee with Hallowswings and the Hall of Famous Americans wax museum with Liberty Launch. In 2004, the park continued to add onto the water park, adding Jungle Racer and Jungle Jets. Bahari Wave Pool was added in 2005, which marked the beginning of an expansion project that would double the size of Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari received its most sought after award in 2004, when it earned the [[Applause Award]] from the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]]. To win the award, awarded every two years, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award.<ref name=\"applause\">{{cite web|title=IAAPA Applause Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-wins-international-applause-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====2006 to 2013====\n\nThe 2006 season marked the 60th anniversary of Holiday World. The park marked it by adding a brand new section: [[Thanksgiving]]. To complement the section, the park added two new rides. The first was [[Gobbler Getaway]], a [[Sally Corporation]] interactive [[dark ride]]. The anchor attraction was the park's third wooden roller coaster, [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], built by [[The Gravity Group]], successors of Custom Coasters International. The addition of The Voyage gained the park national attention once again, as the roller coaster claimed the record for most [[air-time]] of any wooden roller coaster at 24.2 seconds.<ref name=\"voyage\">{{cite web|title=Voyage Brings Spotlight to Holiday World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/voyage-brings-national-spotlight|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> It is also the second longest wooden roller coaster in the world behind only [[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]] at [[Kings Island]]. In its first year of operation, The Voyage was awarded the title of \"Best New Ride\" and #2 wooden roller coaster in the world. From 2007 to 2011, The Voyage was awarded the title of #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by the readers of Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"gta\" /> Also added in 2006 was Bahari River in Splashin' Safari. It was named the \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" by Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"bahari\">{{cite web|title=Best New Rides|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-receives-best-new-ride|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three years, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari opened several new additions. Bakuli and Kima Bay were added to Splashin' Safari, Turkey Whirl and Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9 were added to the Thanksgiving section, the Star Spangled Carousel replaced Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay in the Fourth of July section, and Reindeer Games replaced Kids Castle in the Christmas section. In 2009, Holiday World continued to break records by opening the world's tallest water ride, Pilgrims Plunge, in the Thanksgiving section of the park. Pilgrims Plunge deviated from the standard of using a sloped lift hill, instead opting for an open-air elevator system that takes riders to a height of {{Convert|135|ft}} before dropping them at a forty-five degree angle.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Pilgrims Plunge was renamed to Giraffica in 2013 when the boundaries between the Thanksgiving section and the water park were slightly altered.<ref name=\"2013 Expansion\">{{cite web|title=2013 Expansion|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-invests-65-million-2013-season|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSplashin' Safari broke another record in 2010, when [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] was opened. When Wildebeest opened, it was the world's longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coaster]] at {{Convert|1710|ft}} long. It was also among the first water coasters to use [[linear induction motors]], rather than water jets or [[conveyor belts]], to propel riders up hills. Wildebeest was named \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, as well as \"Best Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"wildebeest\">{{cite web|title=Wildebeest|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/wildebeest|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The park broke its own record just two years later, in 2012, when [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]] opened.

Several members of the Koch family later expressed interest into reviving the park in 2012, but later backed out of the deal. This park would eventually reopen under different management in 2014.\n\nThe park suffered a sudden loss in June 2010 when President and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Will Koch died while swimming at his home. Although the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] coroner listed the official cause of death as drowning, family and park officials believe Koch's [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] played a factor in his death. Soon after his death, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari named Will's younger brother Dan as the park's new President.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite web|title=Will Koch Drowned|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/jun/17/holiday-worlds-will-koch-drowned-says-coroner/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Dan Koch served as the park's President until late 2012, shortly after which the [[board of directors]] announced Matt Eckert as the new President, launching a bitter fight within the family for control of the park and its assets. Matt Eckert was previously one of the parks two [[general manager]]s. Eckert is the first park President not related to the Koch family. They also ousted Pat Koch, Will Sr.'s widow, from any involvement the park. She had been a fixture there for decades.<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2013/10/03/appeals-court-sides-with-widow-in-holiday-world-ownership-dispute/2915659/</ref>\n\nWill Koch's widow Lori and their three children won primary ownership in the park after an ugly court battle and its parent company, Koch Development Corporation. Dan Koch, along with his sister Natalie, would go on in 2014 to form Koch Family Parks and buy [[Alabama Splash Adventure]], a previously troubled theme park in [[Bessemer, Alabama]].<ref name=\"eckert\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World Names New President|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2013/jan/08/no-headline---eckert/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the park has replaced some of its older rides with newer rides. In Holiday World, Blitzen's Airplanes was replaced with Rudolph's Round-Up in 2011 and in 2012 Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was replaced with Sparkler, a {{convert|65|ft}} tall [[Zamperla]] Vertical Swing ride.

Each of the sections features rides, games, food and other attractions that follow the theme of that section's respective holiday. The music that plays over the loud speakers in each section is also themed to that section's respective holiday; guests will often notice the music change as they enter a different section. Splashin' Safari, which is connected to the theme park via entrances in the Halloween and Thanksgiving sections, takes the general theme of a safari.\n\n===Christmas===\nUpon entering Holiday World, guests immediately enter the Christmas section. The Christmas section is the oldest section of Holiday World, dating back to 1946. It was also the only themed area of the park until 1984. Although devoid of any major rides, there is a small sub-section called Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch which is home to several small children's rides. Notable landmarks in this section include a [[Santa Claus]] statue, a [[Christmas tree]], a [[nativity scene]] and the Applause [[fountain]], which was added after the park was awarded the [[IAAPA]] Applause Award in 2004. The Christmas section of the park also includes one of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Kringle's Kaf\u00e9, which serves standard theme park fare such as pizza, burgers and ice cream. Since the park's opening in 1946, Santa Claus has been available daily throughout the season to chat with children.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Comet's Rockets\n|style=white-space:nowrap|1970s\n| Children's rocket ride\n|-\n| Dasher's Seahorses\n| 1970s\n| Children's seahorse ride\n|-\n| Prancer's Merry-Go-Round\n| 1970s\n| Children's [[carousel]]\n|-\n| Reindeer Games\n| 2008\n| Three-story family [[drop tower (ride)|drop ride]]\n|-\n| Rudolph's Round-Up\n| 2011\n| Children's sleigh ride\n|-\n|Dancer's Fish\n|1970s\n|Fish-go-round ([[Bulgy the Whale]])\n|-\n|}\n\n===Halloween===\nThe Halloween section was one of two new holidays added in 1984. Two of the three wooden roller coasters in the park are located here: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]] and [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]]. The area also has a Goblin Burgers restaurant, which resembles a witch's house, the Frightful Falls log flume that intertwines with The Legend, and the main entrance to Splashin' Safari water park. Apart from the architecture, guests will hear the school bell from The Legend's station ringing ominously throughout the section. It introduced '''Kitty Claws''' as its mascot in 2012.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Scarecrow Scrambler\n| 1976\n| [[Eli Bridge Company]]\n| Classic [[twist (ride)|scrambler ride]]\n|-\n| Frightful Falls\n| 1984\n|\n| [[log flume (attraction)|Log flume]]\n|-\n| [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]]\n| 1995\n| [[Custom Coasters International]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"[[The Raven]]\"\n|-\n| [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]]\n| 2000\n| [[Custom Coasters International]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after [[Washington Irving]]'s short story \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\"\n|-\n| HallowSwings\n| 2003\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Custom-made [[Zamperla]] flying carousel [[Chair-O-Planes|swing ride]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Fourth of July===\nThe Fourth of July section was the second of the two holidays that were added in 1984. It introduced '''George the Eagle''' as its mascot. This area features more attractions than any of the four sections in the theme park. Landmarks in this section include the Hoosier Celebration Theater, where many live shows are performed; the Good Old Days Picnic Grove, where numerous shelter houses may be rented out for company picnics; and The Alamo restaurant, which serves traditional Mexican food. The Fourth of July section is also home to a sub-section called Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area which is completely encircled by Holidog Express. Keeping with the Fourth of July theme, there is also a monument with several [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] located right across from The Alamo restaurant in the center of the section.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Eagles Flight\n| 1976\n| [[Flying Scooters|Flying Scooter]]\n|-\n| Rough Riders\n| 1976\n| [[Bumper car]]s themed after former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]]\n|-\n| Lewis & Clark Trail\n| 1978\n| Gould Manufacturing [[Ford Model T|Tin Lizzie]] antique car ride\n|-\n| Tippecanoes\n| 1988\n| Children's [[canoe]] ride; originally called Indian River Canoes, but renamed to Tippecanoes in 2016\n|-\n| Raging Rapids in Boulder Canyon\n| 1990\n| [[River rapids ride]]\n|-\n| Liberty Launch\n| 2003\n| Seven-story [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] [[Double Shot (ride)|Double Shot]]\n|-\n| Revolution\n| 2005\n| Dartron Zero Gravity [[round up (ride)|Round Up]] ride\n|-\n| Star Spangled Carousel\n| 2008\n| [[Carousel]]\n|-\n| Holidog Express\n| 2013\n| [[ridable miniature railway|Ridable miniature train]] ride\n|-\n| Firecracker\n| 2017\n| Restored Calypso ride; named after the park's now-defunct steel coaster that was replaced by Holidog's Funtown in 1997\n|}\n\n====Holidog's FunTown====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Holidog's Treehouse\n| 1999\n|\n| Three-story play structure; the original was replaced with a new wheelchair accessible play structure in 2017\n|-\n| Just for Pups\n| 1999\n|\n| Smaller version of Holidog's Treehouse that is designed for small children\n|-\n| [[The Howler]]\n| 1999\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Family [[steel roller coaster]]\n|-\n| Doggone Trail\n| 1999\n|\n| Children's jeep ride\n|-\n| Magic Waters\n| 1999\n|\n| Spray park area\n|-\n| Kitty's Tea Party\n| 2013\n| Zamperla\n| Classic [[teacups|tea cup]] ride\n|}\n\n===Thanksgiving===\nThe Thanksgiving section is the newest section of the park, added in 2006 to commemorate Holiday World's 60th anniversary. The anchor attraction of this section is [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]] which wraps around parts of the [[Midway (fair)|midway]]; guests walk under The Voyage 's [[brake run]] upon entering the section through Fourth of July. In the back of the Thanksgiving section is [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]], the wing coaster, and a secondary entrance to Splashin' Safari. In addition to The Voyage and Thunderbird, the Thanksgiving section includes the second of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9, which serves typical Thanksgiving food such as [[Domesticated turkey#Turkeys as food|turkey]], [[Standing rib roast|prime rib]], [[Stove Top stuffing|stuffing]], [[green bean]]s and [[bread roll]]s. [[Wild turkey|Turkeys]] can often be heard \"gobbling\" throughout the section as sounds emanate from the Gobbler Getaway ride and Pilgrims' Challenge game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]]\n| 2006\n| [[The Gravity Group]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after the voyage the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] made to America in 1620\n|-\n| [[Gobbler Getaway]]\n| 2006\n| [[Sally Corporation]]\n| Interactive [[dark ride]]\n|-\n| Turkey Whirl\n| 2007\n|[[Larson International]]\n| Turkey-themed [[Tilt-A-Whirl]]\n|-\n| Mayflower\n| 2014\n| [[Chance Rides]]\n| [[Pirate ship (ride)|Swinging ship]] themed after the [[Mayflower]]\n|-\n| [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]]\n| 2015\n| [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]\n| A launched [[wing coaster]] themed around the legendary Thunderbird's flight\n|-\n| Crow's Nest\n| 2012\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| A 65-foot (20 meter) tall vertical swing ride.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themeparktourist.com/news/20110929/4830/holiday-world-replace-paul-reveres-midnight-ride-new-swing-ride-2012|title=Holiday World to replace Paul Revere's Midnight Ride with new swing ride in 2012|date=2011-09-29|website=Theme Park Tourist|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Originally known as '''Sparkler''' when in the Fourth of July section.\n|}\n\n===Splashin' Safari===\nSplashin' Safari, the water park Holiday World added in 1993, has consistently ranked among the best water parks in the United States, even being named as the #1 water park in the United States by [[TripAdvisor]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=TripAdvisor Rankings|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/08/03/tripadvisor-names-top-ten-water-parks-in-united-states/|publisher=Long Island Press|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}</ref> The water park takes the general theme of a safari, with ride names featuring various animals, rivers and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] words. Holiday World has added onto its water park every year from 2002 to 2013. Among those additions are the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], which are also, respectively, the third and first most expensive additions ever made to the park. Unlike a number of other theme parks that necessitate a separate admission fee for the water park, entry to Splashin' Safari is included with admission to Holiday World.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The event features exclusive ride time (ERT) on the park's three wooden roller coasters, plus a select few other rides, both before park opening and after park closing. The event, which was first known as Stark Raven Mad, was temporarily discontinued in 2003 following a death during the event (See: [[Holiday World & Splashin' Safari#Incidents|Incidents]]). In 2006, the event returned after being renamed HoliWood Nights. The park embraces HoliWood's pun on [[Hollywood]] by naming each year's event as a play on the title of a movie. The theme of the 2013 event is \"Dig\", which is a play on the 1988 movie [[Big (film)|Big]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HoliWood Nights|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/clubs|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Rock the World:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Since 2012, Holiday World has hosted a [[Christian music festival]] called Rock the World on a select Saturday in August. Throughout the day, regional [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]] bands perform in the Hoosier Celebration Theater. Once the park closes for the day, a main stage area opens to those with concert tickets. The main stage features a number of nationally known Christian artists and bands who perform well past normal closing hours. (The main stage acts in 2012 were [[Jeremy Camp]], [[Tenth Avenue North]], [[BarlowGirl]] and Hearts of Saints).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rock the World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rocktheworld|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Happy Halloween Weekends:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Since 2012, Holiday World has remained open in October to hold an event called Happy Halloween Weekends. For the last two weekends in September plus the four weekends in October, the park holds family-friendly, Halloween-themed activities. Some of these seasonal attractions include two [[corn maze]]s, [[hayride]]s, a 3-D walk-through attraction similar to a family-friendly [[haunted house]] and a family activity area geared towards children located in the Good Ol' Days Picnic Grove. The park transforms itself into a solely Halloween-themed park, with Halloween decorations, Halloween-themed shows and special Halloween-themed food items.

The victim was visiting the park to attend \"Stark Raven Mad 2003\", an event hosting roller coaster enthusiasts from around the country. At approximately 8:00 pm, the victim and her fianc\u00e9 boarded The Raven in the last row of the train. Following a safety check of her lap bar and seat belt by a ride operator, the train left the station. Multiple witnesses reported that they saw her \"virtually standing up\" during the ride's initial and subsequent drops. During the ride's {{convert|69|ft}} drop, also called the fifth drop, she was ejected from the car and onto the tracks. When the train returned to the station, the victim's fianc\u00e9, ride operators and a passenger who was a doctor ran back along the tracks, at which point they found her lying under the structure of the roller coaster at the fifth drop. The doctor, aided by park medical personnel, began [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] until an ambulance arrived. The victim was pronounced dead en route to the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prosecutor's Report|url=http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|publisher=Spencer County Prosecutor's Office|accessdate=November 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213338/http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|archive-date=October 4, 2011|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n:An investigation following the accident showed that the safety restraints were working properly and that there were no mechanical deficiencies on the roller coaster.

The employee was working alone, mowing an area with some inclines outside the east side of the park when the incident occurred, though the park refused to speculate on exactly what might have happened. The man was found by another employee, who was then able to help lift the lawn mower off the victim with the help of other employees.

The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of [[Sodium hypochlorite|liquid bleach]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and [[nausea]]. They were given [[oxygen]] at the park before being transported to [[Jasper, Indiana|Jasper]] Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening.

The theme park is divided into four sections that celebrate [[Christmas]], [[Halloween]], [[Thanksgiving]] and the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] with rides, live entertainment, games, and attractions.\n\nHoliday World contains three [[wooden roller coaster]]s: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], and [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], as well as [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]] (a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] launched [[Wing Coaster]]) and [[The Howler]]. The safari-themed water park includes the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and Guinness World Record Holder [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], numerous family raft rides and [[water slide]]s, two [[wave pool]]s, junior-sized wave pool, two children's-sized water slide areas, a [[lazy river]], two family \"tipping bucket\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:FreedomTrain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Freedom Train, previously called the Santa Claus Land Railroad, operated from 1946 to 2012]]\n\n===Santa Claus Land===\n\n====Construction====\nPlans for what would become '''Santa Claus Land''', and later '''Holiday World & Splashin' Safari''', were first conceived as a retirement project by Louis J. Koch, a retired industrialist from [[Evansville, Indiana]]. In 1941, Koch visited the town of [[Santa Claus, Indiana]]. A family man and father of nine children, it bothered him that children traveled to the town only to be disappointed when they discovered [[Santa Claus]] was not there. In response, Koch developed the idea for a park where children could have fun and visit Santa year-round. Although initial construction plans were delayed by [[World War II]], construction of Santa Claus Land eventually began on August 4, 1945.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|title=Park History|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-history-santa-claus-land-holiday-world|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/timeline-santa-claus-land-holiday-world-splashin-safari|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> At this time, [[Indiana]] had only one [[amusement park]] which was [[Indiana Beach]] (at the time called Ideal Beach) that had opened in 1926, 20 years before Santa Claus Land opened.\n\n====Opening to 1954====\nSanta Claus Land opened on August 3, 1946. At no cost, the park offered a Santa, a toy shop, toy displays, a restaurant and themed children's rides, one of which was The Freedom Train. After overcoming doubts about the park's ability for success, Louis Koch's son, [[William A. Koch|William A. \"Bill\" Koch, Sr.]], took over as head of Santa Claus Land. In the following years, Bill Koch continued to add to the park, including the first Jeep-Go-Round ever manufactured, a new restaurant and a deer farm which was eventually home to fourteen [[Fallow deer|European white fallow deer]].<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"deer\">{{cite web|title=Holiblog|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029220227/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|archive-date=October 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reagan1955.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Future President Ronald Reagan visited in 1955]]\n\n====1955 to 1975====\n[[File:SantaClausLand Aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An aerial view of Santa Claus Land taken around 1957]]\nBeginning in 1955, Santa Claus Land charged admission for the first time; adults were charged 50 cents while children continued to be admitted for free. Despite the new cost of admission, attendance continued to grow with the park. The Pleasureland ride section, which exists today as Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch, debuted in 1955. In the early 1970s, additional children's rides, including Dasher's Seahorses, Comet's Rockets, Blitzen's Airplanes, and Prancer's Merry-Go-Round, were added to this section. From 1959 to 1961, the first live entertainment, the Willie Bartley [[waterskiing|Water Ski]] Thrill Show, performed on Lake Rudolph each summer. A Santa Claus Choir composed of local children also performed at the park in 1970 and 1971.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIn 1960, Bill Koch married Patricia \"Pat\" Yellig, the daughter of Jim Yellig, the park's Santa Claus. Bill and Pat Koch would have five children: Will, Kristi, Daniel, Philip, and Natalie.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n====1976 to 1983====\nIn 1976, Santa Claus Land shifted its focus, along with its entrance, which was moved from [[Indiana State Road 162|State Road 162]] to its present location on [[Indiana State Road 245|State Road 245]]. The park began to focus on the entire family, rather than just children. The park added nine new rides by 1984, eight of which they hoped would appeal to older children and adults alike. Eagle's Flight, Rough Riders, Roundhouse, Virginia Reel, Scarecrow Scrambler, Lewis & Clark Trail, Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay were all targeted towards families, while Dancer's Thunder Bumpers Junior was built for children who weren't quite ready for the larger version of the ride.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n===Holiday World===\n[[File:FrightfulFalls.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early photo of Frightful Falls showing what it looked like prior to the construction of [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]] in this area]]\n\n====1984 to 1992====\nBy 1984, the Koch Family had realized the theming possibilities beyond [[Christmas]]. Santa Claus Land soon saw the first major expansion in park history with the addition of a [[Halloween]] section and a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] section. With the inclusion of more than just Christmas, '''Santa Claus Land''' formally changed its name to '''Holiday World'''. In the following years, Frightful Falls and Banshee were added to the Halloween section, Raging Rapids was added to the Fourth of July section in 1990, and Kringle's Kaf\u00e9 restaurant was built in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIt was also during this time period that Holiday World saw a change in leadership. Will Koch, the eldest of Bill Koch's children, took over as President of the park. Another of Bill Koch's children, Daniel \"Dan\" Koch, became chairman of the board.<ref name=\"patriarch\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World's Patriarch|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-patriarch-leaves-legacy|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Holiday World & Splashin' Safari===\n[[File:TheRaven.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An early photo of The Raven.

In its first year of operation, Splashin' Safari operated with Congo River, Crocodile Isle, AmaZOOM and Bamboo Chute. The Wave was added the following year.\n\nThe park added the first of its three [[wooden roller coaster]]s in 1995 with [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], built by [[Custom Coasters International]]. The Raven was named \"Ride of the Year\" and was voted as the world's second best wooden roller coaster. In 2000, The Raven was ranked as the #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by [[Amusement Today]] magazine. It held the top spot for a total of four years.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> As of the 2011 awards, The Raven has remained ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world.<ref name=\"gta\">{{cite web|title=2011 Golden Ticket Awards |url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |publisher=Amusement Today |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025513/http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years, the park made only two additions. The first was the addition of Monsoon Lagoon in Splashin' Safari. The second was the replacement of Firecracker with Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring Holidog's Treehouse, The Howler, Doggone Trail and Magic Waters.\n\n[[File:Zinga.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Zinga]]\n\nIn 2000, Custom Coasters International added another wooden roller coaster. [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], based on [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\", was opened immediately adjacent to The Raven and is taller, longer, and faster than The Raven. The Legend's ranking reached its peak in 2002, when it was voted the fourth best wooden roller coaster in the world.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Much like The Raven, The Legend continues to be ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world, as of the 2011 awards.<ref name=\"gta\" /> In 2000, the park also began offering its guests free unlimited soft drinks, a service which brought international attention to the park.<ref name=\"drinks\">{{cite web|title=Free Drinks Wins Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-free-drinks-wins-international-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Holiday World was the first park in the world to offer this service to its guests.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nFor the next five years, the park's additions grew steadily. In 2002, ZOOMbabwe, the world's largest enclosed water slide, was added to Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"zoombabwe\">{{cite web|title=ZOOMbabwe|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/zoombabwe|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2003, Splashin' Safari added Zinga on top of The Legend's spiral drop, a [[ProSlide Tornado]], while Holiday World replaced Banshee with Hallowswings and the Hall of Famous Americans wax museum with Liberty Launch. In 2004, the park continued to add onto the water park, adding Jungle Racer and Jungle Jets. Bahari Wave Pool was added in 2005, which marked the beginning of an expansion project that would double the size of Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari received its most sought after award in 2004, when it earned the [[Applause Award]] from the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]]. To win the award, awarded every two years, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award.<ref name=\"applause\">{{cite web|title=IAAPA Applause Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-wins-international-applause-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====2006 to 2013====\n\nThe 2006 season marked the 60th anniversary of Holiday World. The park marked it by adding a brand new section: [[Thanksgiving]]. To complement the section, the park added two new rides. The first was [[Gobbler Getaway]], a [[Sally Corporation]] interactive [[dark ride]]. The anchor attraction was the park's third wooden roller coaster, [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], built by [[The Gravity Group]], successors of Custom Coasters International. The addition of The Voyage gained the park national attention once again, as the roller coaster claimed the record for most [[air-time]] of any wooden roller coaster at 24.2 seconds.<ref name=\"voyage\">{{cite web|title=Voyage Brings Spotlight to Holiday World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/voyage-brings-national-spotlight|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> It is also the second longest wooden roller coaster in the world behind only [[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]] at [[Kings Island]]. In its first year of operation, The Voyage was awarded the title of \"Best New Ride\" and #2 wooden roller coaster in the world. From 2007 to 2011, The Voyage was awarded the title of #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by the readers of Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"gta\" /> Also added in 2006 was Bahari River in Splashin' Safari. It was named the \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" by Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"bahari\">{{cite web|title=Best New Rides|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-receives-best-new-ride|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three years, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari opened several new additions. Bakuli and Kima Bay were added to Splashin' Safari, Turkey Whirl and Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9 were added to the Thanksgiving section, the Star Spangled Carousel replaced Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay in the Fourth of July section, and Reindeer Games replaced Kids Castle in the Christmas section. In 2009, Holiday World continued to break records by opening the world's tallest water ride, Pilgrims Plunge, in the Thanksgiving section of the park. Pilgrims Plunge deviated from the standard of using a sloped lift hill, instead opting for an open-air elevator system that takes riders to a height of {{Convert|135|ft}} before dropping them at a forty-five degree angle.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Pilgrims Plunge was renamed to Giraffica in 2013 when the boundaries between the Thanksgiving section and the water park were slightly altered.<ref name=\"2013 Expansion\">{{cite web|title=2013 Expansion|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-invests-65-million-2013-season|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSplashin' Safari broke another record in 2010, when [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] was opened. When Wildebeest opened, it was the world's longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coaster]] at {{Convert|1710|ft}} long. It was also among the first water coasters to use [[linear induction motors]], rather than water jets or [[conveyor belts]], to propel riders up hills. Wildebeest was named \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, as well as \"Best Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"wildebeest\">{{cite web|title=Wildebeest|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/wildebeest|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The park broke its own record just two years later, in 2012, when [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]] opened.

Several members of the Koch family later expressed interest into reviving the park in 2012, but later backed out of the deal. This park would eventually reopen under different management in 2014.\n\nThe park suffered a sudden loss in June 2010 when President and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Will Koch died while swimming at his home. Although the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] coroner listed the official cause of death as drowning, family and park officials believe Koch's [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] played a factor in his death. Soon after his death, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari named Will's younger brother Dan as the park's new President.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite web|title=Will Koch Drowned|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/jun/17/holiday-worlds-will-koch-drowned-says-coroner/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Dan Koch served as the park's President until late 2012, shortly after which the [[board of directors]] announced Matt Eckert as the new President, launching a bitter fight within the family for control of the park and its assets. Matt Eckert was previously one of the parks two [[general manager]]s. Eckert is the first park President not related to the Koch family. They also ousted Pat Koch, Will Sr.'s widow, from any involvement the park. She had been a fixture there for decades.<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2013/10/03/appeals-court-sides-with-widow-in-holiday-world-ownership-dispute/2915659/</ref>\n\nWill Koch's widow Lori and their three children won primary ownership in the park after an ugly court battle and its parent company, Koch Development Corporation. Dan Koch, along with his sister Natalie, would go on in 2014 to form Koch Family Parks and buy [[Alabama Splash Adventure]], a previously troubled theme park in [[Bessemer, Alabama]].<ref name=\"eckert\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World Names New President|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2013/jan/08/no-headline---eckert/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the park has replaced some of its older rides with newer rides. In Holiday World, Blitzen's Airplanes was replaced with Rudolph's Round-Up in 2011 and in 2012 Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was replaced with Sparkler, a {{convert|65|ft}} tall [[Zamperla]] Vertical Swing ride. Due to limited vertical clearance for Sparkler, the park decided to relocate Star Spangled Carousel to the former location of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and to place Sparkler in the carousel's place.<ref name=\"swing\">{{cite web|title=Vertical Swing|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3654|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122025246/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3654|archivedate=November 22, 2011|df=}}</ref> The following year, Holiday World removed part of Holidog's Treehouse to make room for a new [[teacups|tea cup]] ride called Kitty's Tea Party.

This is B&M's first launched coaster ([[The Incredible Hulk (roller coaster)|The Incredible Hulk Coaster]] at [[Universal's Islands of Adventure]]'s launch was created by Universal, not B&M).

Each of the sections features rides, games, food and other attractions that follow the theme of that section's respective holiday. The music that plays over the loud speakers in each section is also themed to that section's respective holiday; guests will often notice the music change as they enter a different section. Splashin' Safari, which is connected to the theme park via entrances in the Halloween and Thanksgiving sections, takes the general theme of a safari.\n\n===Christmas===\nUpon entering Holiday World, guests immediately enter the Christmas section. The Christmas section is the oldest section of Holiday World, dating back to 1946. It was also the only themed area of the park until 1984. Although devoid of any major rides, there is a small sub-section called Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch which is home to several small children's rides. Notable landmarks in this section include a [[Santa Claus]] statue, a [[Christmas tree]], a [[nativity scene]] and the Applause [[fountain]], which was added after the park was awarded the [[IAAPA]] Applause Award in 2004. The Christmas section of the park also includes one of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Kringle's Kaf\u00e9, which serves standard theme park fare such as pizza, burgers and ice cream. Since the park's opening in 1946, Santa Claus has been available daily throughout the season to chat with children.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Comet's Rockets\n|style=white-space:nowrap|1970s\n| Children's rocket ride\n|-\n| Dasher's Seahorses\n| 1970s\n| Children's seahorse ride\n|-\n| Prancer's Merry-Go-Round\n| 1970s\n| Children's [[carousel]]\n|-\n| Reindeer Games\n| 2008\n| Three-story family [[drop tower (ride)|drop ride]]\n|-\n| Rudolph's Round-Up\n| 2011\n| Children's sleigh ride\n|-\n|Dancer's Fish\n|1970s\n|Fish-go-round ([[Bulgy the Whale]])\n|-\n|}\n\n===Halloween===\nThe Halloween section was one of two new holidays added in 1984. Two of the three wooden roller coasters in the park are located here: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]] and [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]]. The area also has a Goblin Burgers restaurant, which resembles a witch's house, the Frightful Falls log flume that intertwines with The Legend, and the main entrance to Splashin' Safari water park. Apart from the architecture, guests will hear the school bell from The Legend's station ringing ominously throughout the section. It introduced '''Kitty Claws''' as its mascot in 2012.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Scarecrow Scrambler\n| 1976\n| [[Eli Bridge Company]]\n| Classic [[twist (ride)|scrambler ride]]\n|-\n| Frightful Falls\n| 1984\n|\n| [[log flume (attraction)|Log flume]]\n|-\n| [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]]\n| 1995\n| [[Custom Coasters International]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"[[The Raven]]\"\n|-\n| [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]]\n| 2000\n| [[Custom Coasters International]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after [[Washington Irving]]'s short story \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\"\n|-\n| HallowSwings\n| 2003\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Custom-made [[Zamperla]] flying carousel [[Chair-O-Planes|swing ride]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Fourth of July===\nThe Fourth of July section was the second of the two holidays that were added in 1984. It introduced '''George the Eagle''' as its mascot. This area features more attractions than any of the four sections in the theme park. Landmarks in this section include the Hoosier Celebration Theater, where many live shows are performed; the Good Old Days Picnic Grove, where numerous shelter houses may be rented out for company picnics; and The Alamo restaurant, which serves traditional Mexican food. The Fourth of July section is also home to a sub-section called Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area which is completely encircled by Holidog Express. Keeping with the Fourth of July theme, there is also a monument with several [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] located right across from The Alamo restaurant in the center of the section.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Eagles Flight\n| 1976\n| [[Flying Scooters|Flying Scooter]]\n|-\n| Rough Riders\n| 1976\n| [[Bumper car]]s themed after former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]]\n|-\n| Lewis & Clark Trail\n| 1978\n| Gould Manufacturing [[Ford Model T|Tin Lizzie]] antique car ride\n|-\n| Tippecanoes\n| 1988\n| Children's [[canoe]] ride; originally called Indian River Canoes, but renamed to Tippecanoes in 2016\n|-\n| Raging Rapids in Boulder Canyon\n| 1990\n| [[River rapids ride]]\n|-\n| Liberty Launch\n| 2003\n| Seven-story [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] [[Double Shot (ride)|Double Shot]]\n|-\n| Revolution\n| 2005\n| Dartron Zero Gravity [[round up (ride)|Round Up]] ride\n|-\n| Star Spangled Carousel\n| 2008\n| [[Carousel]]\n|-\n| Holidog Express\n| 2013\n| [[ridable miniature railway|Ridable miniature train]] ride\n|-\n| Firecracker\n| 2017\n| Restored Calypso ride; named after the park's now-defunct steel coaster that was replaced by Holidog's Funtown in 1997\n|}\n\n====Holidog's FunTown====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Holidog's Treehouse\n| 1999\n|\n| Three-story play structure; the original was replaced with a new wheelchair accessible play structure in 2017\n|-\n| Just for Pups\n| 1999\n|\n| Smaller version of Holidog's Treehouse that is designed for small children\n|-\n| [[The Howler]]\n| 1999\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Family [[steel roller coaster]]\n|-\n| Doggone Trail\n| 1999\n|\n| Children's jeep ride\n|-\n| Magic Waters\n| 1999\n|\n| Spray park area\n|-\n| Kitty's Tea Party\n| 2013\n| Zamperla\n| Classic [[teacups|tea cup]] ride\n|}\n\n===Thanksgiving===\nThe Thanksgiving section is the newest section of the park, added in 2006 to commemorate Holiday World's 60th anniversary. The anchor attraction of this section is [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]] which wraps around parts of the [[Midway (fair)|midway]]; guests walk under The Voyage 's [[brake run]] upon entering the section through Fourth of July. In the back of the Thanksgiving section is [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]], the wing coaster, and a secondary entrance to Splashin' Safari. In addition to The Voyage and Thunderbird, the Thanksgiving section includes the second of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9, which serves typical Thanksgiving food such as [[Domesticated turkey#Turkeys as food|turkey]], [[Standing rib roast|prime rib]], [[Stove Top stuffing|stuffing]], [[green bean]]s and [[bread roll]]s.

Holiday World has added onto its water park every year from 2002 to 2013. Among those additions are the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], which are also, respectively, the third and first most expensive additions ever made to the park. Unlike a number of other theme parks that necessitate a separate admission fee for the water park, entry to Splashin' Safari is included with admission to Holiday World.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The victim was visiting the park to attend \"Stark Raven Mad 2003\", an event hosting roller coaster enthusiasts from around the country. At approximately 8:00 pm, the victim and her fianc\u00e9 boarded The Raven in the last row of the train. Following a safety check of her lap bar and seat belt by a ride operator, the train left the station. Multiple witnesses reported that they saw her \"virtually standing up\" during the ride's initial and subsequent drops. During the ride's {{convert|69|ft}} drop, also called the fifth drop, she was ejected from the car and onto the tracks. When the train returned to the station, the victim's fianc\u00e9, ride operators and a passenger who was a doctor ran back along the tracks, at which point they found her lying under the structure of the roller coaster at the fifth drop. The doctor, aided by park medical personnel, began [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] until an ambulance arrived. The victim was pronounced dead en route to the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prosecutor's Report|url=http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|publisher=Spencer County Prosecutor's Office|accessdate=November 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213338/http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|archive-date=October 4, 2011|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n:An investigation following the accident showed that the safety restraints were working properly and that there were no mechanical deficiencies on the roller coaster.

Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and [[nausea]]. They were given [[oxygen]] at the park before being transported to [[Jasper, Indiana|Jasper]] Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening.
