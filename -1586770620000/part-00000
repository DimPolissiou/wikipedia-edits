{"title_page": "President's rule", "text_new": "{{redirect|Direct rule in India|direct rule over India in the colonial period|British Raj}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=November 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\nIn [[India]], '''president's rule''' is the suspension of state government and imposition of direct [[Government of India|central government]] rule in a [[States of India|state]]. Under [[Article 356]] of the [[Constitution of India]], in the event that a [[State governments of India|state government]] is unable to function according to constitutional provisions, the Central government can take direct control of the state machinery. Subsequently, executive authority is exercised through the centrally appointed [[Governors of states of India|governor]], who has the authority to appoint other administrators to assist them. The administrators are usually nonpartisan retired civil servants.\n\nWhen a state government is functioning correctly, it is run by an elected Council of Ministers responsible to the state's legislative assembly ([[Vidhan Sabha]]). The council is led by the [[Chief Minister (India)|chief minister]], who is the ''de facto'' chief executive of the state; the Governor is only a ''de jure'' constitutional head. However, during president's rule, the Council of Ministers is dissolved, vacating the office of Chief Minister. Furthermore, the Vidhan Sabha is either [[:wikt:prorogued|prorogued]] or [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolved]], necessitating a new election.\n\nPrior to 2019, the [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir|constitution]] of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] had a similar system of ''governor's rule'', under its Section 92. The state's governor issued a proclamation, after obtaining the consent of the [[President of India]]. After the [[Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status|revocation]] of [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|Article 370]], President's rule applies to Jammu and Kashmir under section 73 (Since Article 356 of Constitution of India does not apply to union territories) of [[Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019]].\n\nFollowing its landmark judgment in the 1994 [[S. R. Bommai v. Union of India|''Bommai'' case]], the [[Supreme Court of India]] has restricted arbitrary impositions of president's rule. \n\n[[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Telangana]] are the only states where the president's rule has not been imposed so far.\n\n==Imposition==\nIn practice, president's rule has been imposed under any one of the following different circumstances:\n\n*A state legislature is unable to elect a leader as chief minister for a time prescribed by the Governor of that state, at the Will of Governor.\n*Breakdown of a coalition leading to the Chief minister having minority support in the house and the Chief minister fails/will definitely fail to prove otherwise, within a time prescribed by the Governor of that state.\n*Loss of majority in the assembly due to a vote of no-confidence in the house.\n*Elections postponed for unavoidable reasons like war, epidemic or natural disasters.\n\n* Article 356 state that the president can invoke president rule in a state on the report of the governor if the state machinery/legislature fails to abide by constitutional norms.\n\nIf approved by both houses, president's rule can continue for 6 months. It can be extended for a maximum of 3 years with the approval of the Parliament done every 6 months. If the [[Lok Sabha]] is dissolved during this time, the rule is valid for 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha provided that this continuance has already been approved by [[Rajya Sabha]]. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 introduced a new provision to put a restraint on the power of the Parliament to extend the president's rule in a state. According to this provision, the president's rule can only be extended over a year every 6 months under the following conditions:\n* There is already a national emergency throughout India, or in the whole or any part of the state.\n* The [[Election Commission of India|Election Commission]] certifies that elections cannot be conducted in the concerned state.\nPresident's rule can be revoked at any time by the president and does not need the Parliament's approval.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, president's rule was often imposed in states through abusing the authority of Governors who were in collusion with the central government. The Supreme Court of India in March 1994 instituted a rule by which such abuse has been drastically reduced.\n==Imposition in Union Territories with legislative assembly==\n\nArticle 356 is not applicable to Union Territories, so there are many ways by which president's rule can be imposed in different Union Territories with legislative assembly.\n=== Jammu and Kashmir===\nUntil the [[Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir|revocation of Article 370]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019|bifurcation]]  into two Union territories, President's rule applied after the implication of Governor's rule for 6 months.\n\nAfter the revocation and bifurcation, the reorganised Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is subject to the section 73 of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019]], which is used to impose President's rule as the Article 356 is not applicable to Union Territories. The provision states:\n{{quote|'''73.''' If the President, on receipt of a report from the Lieutenant Governor of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, or otherwise, is satisfied,\u2014\n\n''(a)'' that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the Union territory\nof Jammu and Kashmir cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this\nAct, or\n\n''(b)'' that for the proper administration of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir it\nis necessary or expedient so to do,\n\nthe President may, by order, suspend the operation of all or any of the provisions of this Act\nfor such period as he thinks fit and make such incidental and consequential provisions as\nmay appear to him to be necessary or expedient for administering the Union territory of\nJammu and Kashmir in accordance with the provisions of this Act.}}\n\n=== Delhi ===\n\nIn NCT of Delhi the president's rule is applied on the basis of Article 239AB of the Constitution of India (as the Article 356 is not applicable to Union Territories) which reads as-\n\n{{quote|'''239AB.

In the 1970s and 1980s, it was common for the central government to dismiss state governments led by opposition parties.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sarkaria Commission Report \u2013 CHAPTER VI : Emergency Provisions |url=http://interstatecouncil.nic.in/Sarkaria/CHAPTERVI.pdf |accessdate=28 September 2014 }}</ref> The [[Indira Gandhi]] regime and post-emergency [[Janata government|Janata Party]] were noted for this practice. Indira Gandhi's government between 1966 and 1977 is known to have imposed president's rule 39 times in different states. Similarly, the Janata Party which came to power after the emergency issued president's rule in 9 states which were ruled by Congress.\n\nThe practice was limited only after the Supreme Court established strict guidelines for imposing president's rule in its ruling on the ''[[S. R. Bommai v. Union of India]]'' case in 1994. This landmark judgement has helped curtail the widespread misuse of Article 356. The judgement established strict guidelines for imposing president's rule. Subsequent pronouncements by the Supreme Court in Jharkhand and other states have further limited the scope for misuse of Article 356. Only since the early 2000s has the number of cases of imposition of president's rule has been drastically reduced.\n\n'''Article 356''' has always been the focal point of a wider debate of the [[Federalism in India|federal structure]] of government in Indian polity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ncrwc/finalreport/v2b2-5.htm |title=National Commission to Review the Working of the Article 356 of the constitution |year=2001 |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>  The [[Sarkaria Commission]] Report on Centre-State Relations 1983 has recommended that Article 356 must be used \"very sparingly, in extreme cases, as a measure of last resort, when all the other alternatives fail to prevent or rectify a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Sarkaria Commission Report \u2013 CHAPTER VI: Emergency Provisions |url=http://interstatecouncil.nic.in/Sarkaria/CHAPTERVI.pdf |accessdate=28 September 2014 }}</ref> Dr. Ambedkar also said that it would be like a \"dead letter\" (i.e. would be used rarely).\n\n==List of instances==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n ! width=\"100\" | State\n! width=\"100\" | Date of imposition\n!width=100| Date of revocation\n !width=100| Duration\n!Reason(s) to impose the President's rule\n|-\n |[[Andhra Pradesh]] [1]\n | 18 January 1973\n | 10 December 1973\n | {{ayd|18 January 1976|10 December 1976}}\n | Breakdown of law & order due to [[1972 Jai Andhra movement|Jai Andhra Agitation]], in [[P.

Under [[Article 356]] of the [[Constitution of India]], in the event that a [[State governments of India|state government]] is unable to function according to constitutional provisions, the Central government can take direct control of the state machinery. Subsequently, executive authority is exercised through the centrally appointed [[Governors of states of India|governor]], who has the authority to appoint other administrators to assist them. The administrators are usually nonpartisan retired civil servants.\n\nWhen a state government is functioning correctly, it is run by an elected Council of Ministers responsible to the state's legislative assembly ([[Vidhan Sabha]]). The council is led by the [[Chief Minister (India)|chief minister]], who is the ''de facto'' chief executive of the state; the Governor is only a ''de jure'' constitutional head. However, during president's rule, the Council of Ministers is dissolved, vacating the office of Chief Minister. Furthermore, the Vidhan Sabha is either [[:wikt:prorogued|prorogued]] or [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolved]], necessitating a new election.\n\nPrior to 2019, the [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir|constitution]] of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] had a similar system of ''governor's rule'', under its Section 92. The state's governor issued a proclamation, after obtaining the consent of the [[President of India]]. After the [[Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status|revocation]] of [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|Article 370]], President's rule applies to Jammu and Kashmir under section 73 (Since Article 356 of Constitution of India does not apply to union territories) of [[Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019]].\n\nFollowing its landmark judgment in the 1994 [[S. R. Bommai v. Union of India|''Bommai'' case]], the [[Supreme Court of India]] has restricted arbitrary impositions of president's rule. \n\n[[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Telangana]] are the only states where the president's rule has not been imposed so far.\n\n==Imposition==\nIn practice, president's rule has been imposed under any one of the following different circumstances:\n\n*A state legislature is unable to elect a leader as chief minister for a time prescribed by the Governor of that state, at the Will of Governor.\n*Breakdown of a coalition leading to the Chief minister having minority support in the house and the Chief minister fails/will definitely fail to prove otherwise, within a time prescribed by the Governor of that state.\n*Loss of majority in the assembly due to a vote of no-confidence in the house.\n*Elections postponed for unavoidable reasons like war, epidemic or natural disasters.\n\n* Article 356 state that the president can invoke president rule in a state on the report of the governor if the state machinery/legislature fails to abide by constitutional norms.\n\nIf approved by both houses, president's rule can continue for 6 months. It can be extended for a maximum of 3 years with the approval of the Parliament done every 6 months. If the [[Lok Sabha]] is dissolved during this time, the rule is valid for 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha provided that this continuance has already been approved by [[Rajya Sabha]]. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 introduced a new provision to put a restraint on the power of the Parliament to extend the president's rule in a state. According to this provision, the president's rule can only be extended over a year every 6 months under the following conditions:\n* There is already a national emergency throughout India, or in the whole or any part of the state.\n* The [[Election Commission of India|Election Commission]] certifies that elections cannot be conducted in the concerned state.\nPresident's rule can be revoked at any time by the president and does not need the Parliament's approval.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, president's rule was often imposed in states through abusing the authority of Governors who were in collusion with the central government. The Supreme Court of India in March 1994 instituted a rule by which such abuse has been drastically reduced.\n==Imposition in Union Territories with legislative assembly==\n\nArticle 356 is not applicable to Union Territories, so there are many ways by which president's rule can be imposed in different Union Territories with legislative assembly.\n=== Jammu and Kashmir===\nUntil the [(Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir|revocation of Article 370)] and [(Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019|bifurcation)]  into two Union territories, President's rule applied after the implication of Governor's rule for 6 months.\n\nAfter the revocation and bifurcation, the reorganised Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is subject to the section 73 of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019]], which is used to impose President's rule as the Article 356 is not applicable to Union Territories. The provision states:\n{{quote|'''73.''' If the President, on receipt of a report from the Lieutenant Governor of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, or otherwise, is satisfied,\u2014\n\n''(a)'' that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the Union territory\nof Jammu and Kashmir cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this\nAct, or\n\n''(b)'' that for the proper administration of Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir it\nis necessary or expedient so to do,\n\nthe President may, by order, suspend the operation of all or any of the provisions of this Act\nfor such period as he thinks fit and make such incidental and consequential provisions as\nmay appear to him to be necessary or expedient for administering the Union territory of\nJammu and Kashmir in accordance with the provisions of this Act.}}\n\n=== Delhi ===\n\nIn NCT of Delhi the president's rule is applied on the basis of Article 239AB of the Constitution of India (as the Article 356 is not applicable to Union Territories) which reads as-\n\n{{quote|'''239AB.

In the 1970s and 1980s, it was common for the central government to dismiss state governments led by opposition parties.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sarkaria Commission Report \u2013 CHAPTER VI : Emergency Provisions |url=http://interstatecouncil.nic.in/Sarkaria/CHAPTERVI.pdf |accessdate=28 September 2014 }}</ref> The [[Indira Gandhi]] regime and post-emergency [[Janata government|Janata Party]] were noted for this practice. Indira Gandhi's government between 1966 and 1977 is known to have imposed president's rule 39 times in different states. Similarly, the Janata Party which came to power after the emergency issued president's rule in 9 states which were ruled by Congress.\n\nThe practice was limited only after the Supreme Court established strict guidelines for imposing president's rule in its ruling on the ''[[S. R. Bommai v. Union of India]]'' case in 1994. This landmark judgement has helped curtail the widespread misuse of Article 356. The judgement established strict guidelines for imposing president's rule. Subsequent pronouncements by the Supreme Court in Jharkhand and other states have further limited the scope for misuse of Article 356.
