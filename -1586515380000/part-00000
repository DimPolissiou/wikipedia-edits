Water and other volatiles in the down-going plate cause [[flux melting]] in the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]], creating magma that rises and penetrates the overriding plate, forming a [[volcanic arc]]. The weight of the down-going slab flexes the down-going plate creating an [[oceanic trench]]. The area between the trench and the arc is the forearc region, and the area behind the arc (i.e. on the side away from the trench) is the [[back-arc region]].\n\nInitial theories proposed that the oceanic trenches and magmatic arcs were the primary suppliers of the accretionary sedimentation wedges in the forearc regions. More recent discovery suggests that some of the accreted material in the forearc region is from a mantle source along with trench turbidites derived from continental material. This theory holds due to evidence of pelagic sediments and continental crust being subducted in processes known as sediment subduction and subduction erosion respectively.<ref name=\"Kearey et al. 2006\"/>\n\nOver geological time there is constant recycling of the forearc deposits due to erosion, deformation and sedimentary subduction. The constant circulation of material in the forearc region (accretionary prism, forearc basin and trench) generates a mixture of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary sequences. In general, there is an increase in metamorphic grade from trench to arc where highest grade (blueschist to eclogite) is structurally uplifted (in the prisms) compared to the younger deposits (basins).  Forearc regions are also where ophiolites are emplaced should [[obduction]] occur, but such deposits are not continuous and can often be removed by erosion.<ref name=\"Kearey et al. 2006\"/><ref name=\"Caset and Dewey 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Casey|first=J. |last2=Dewey |first2=J. |title = Arc/Forearc Lengthening at Plate Triple junctions and the Formation of Ophiolitic Soles |journal = Geological Research Abstracts|year=2013 |volume=13 |pages=13430 |bibcode=2013EGUGA..1513430C }}</ref>\n\nAs tectonic plates converge, the closing of an ocean will result in the convergence of two landmasses, each of which is either an [[island arc]] or continental margin.

Between the break and the magmatic arc, a sedimentary basin filled with erosive material from the volcanic arc and substrate can accumulate into a forearc basin which overlays the oldest thrust slices in the wedge of the forearc region.<ref name=\"Kearey et al. 2006\"/>\n\nIn general, the forearc topography (specifically in the trench region) is trying to achieve an equilibrium between buoyancy and tectonic forces caused by subduction. Upward motion of the forearc is related to buoyancy forces and the downward motion is associated with the tectonic forcing which causes the oceanic lithosphere to descend.<ref name=\"Kearey et al. 2006\"/> The relationship between surface slope and subduction thrust also plays a huge role in the variation of forearc structure and deformation.<ref name=\"Fuller et al. 2006\"/> A subduction wedge can be classified as either stable with little deformation or unstable with pervasive internal deformation (see section on Models). Some common deformation in forearc sediments are [[Synsedimentary fold|synsedimentary deformation]] and [[olistostrome]]s, such as  that seen in the [[Magnitogorsk]] forearc region.<ref name=\"Brown and Spadea 1999\"/>\n\n==Models==\n[[File:Types of Forearcs.jpg|thumb|Types of forearcs]]\nThere are two models which characterize a forearc basin formation and deformation and are dependent on sediment deposition and subsidence (see figure). The first model is associated with a forearc basin formed with little to no sediment supply. Conversely, the second model is associated with sediment supply. Topographic depressions which are accretionary and nonaccretionary in nature will depend on the supply of oceanic plate sediments, continentally derived clastic material and orthogonal convergence rates.<ref name=\"Fuller et al. 2006\"/><ref name=\"Kearey et al. 2006\"/> The accretionary flux (sediment supply in and out) also determines the rate at which the sedimentation wedges grow within the forearc.<ref name=\"Fuller et al. 2006\"/>\n\nThe age of the oceanic crust along with the convergent velocity controls the coupling across the converging interface of the continental and oceanic crust. The strength of this coupling controls the deformation associated with the event and can be seen in the forearc region deformation signatures.<ref name=\"Kearey et al. 2006\"/>\n\n==Seismicity==\n\nThe intense interaction between the overriding and underthrusting plates in the forearc regions have shown to evolve strong coupling mechanisms which result in megathrust earthquakes such as the Tohoku-oki earthquake which occurred off the Pacific coast of Northeast Japan (Tian and Liu. 2013). These mega thrust earthquakes may be correlated with low values of heat flow generally associated with forearc regions.

He went to the United States to study at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1989. He got back to Japan in 1991 as his mother died. Preparing to return to the United States again, he suddenly had an accident with his lower back, forcing him to stay until a full recovery, which took him six years. As the backache eased by treatment and therapy, he grew determined to become an actor, at which point he entered acting school.<ref name=\"shijiemingren.com\"/><ref name=\"xc27.com\"/>\n\n==Entertainment career==\nShibuya started his acting career in 1993. Determined to become globally active, he felt the need to accumulate experiences in Japan first until an opportunity occurs. Besides acting on a daily basis, Shibuya further improved his performing skill in various ways, including method acting class taught by Yoko Narahashi who would later become a prominent figure of Japanese film industry at United Performers\u2019Studio which associated with NY Actors Studio, (Method [[Method acting]] later became Shibuya's present basic style of acting) ; film acting classes at Eizoujuku, a professional film college founded by Genji Nakamura, director of over 40 films; Japanese classical dancing class from Nishikawa\u2019 Kazuma, the master of Nishikawa school; vocal training at AK MUSIC specializing in opera, chanson and pop music. Shibuya acted in a number of independent and short films, in addition to his guest appearances for various film productions, which familiarized him with their methods and styles. Meanwhile, he had also taken part in filmmaking. He would even sing his original songs while playing guitar. Shibuya sought improvement day and night.\n \nShibuya's commercial debut was in Sadistic Song (1995), a film directed by Genji Nakamura. And in 1997 comes theatric opportunities for Shibuya. In March, he participated in Bolero, a famous ballet work. The performance was choreographed by Maurice B\u00e9jart, directed by Shiro Mizoshita of Tokyo Ballet, as one of dance ensembles presented at Tokyo culture hall. In July, he took parts in Princess Sayo, as both a character and Japanese folk dancer. In August 1997, Shibuya served as assistant director in Annie Get Your Gun, a famous Broadway musical, in Nagoya Chunichi Theater. In the next year, he had the longed opportunity to work with a famous theatric director. He passed the audition and played Capulet in Romeo and Juliet, as directed by [[Yukio Ninagawa]]. He kept at his cinematic career nonetheless. In 2001, Shibuya got a role in Agitator, a film by [[Takashi Miike]], prolific filmmaker. He played a member of the Mafia, who would support his leader played by [[Naoto Takenaka]]. Shibuya was only able to play small bits as detective, gangster, doctor, lawyer during this period. Shibuya's first experience with computer-generated animation was in ''[[Appleseed (2004 film)|Appleseed]]''. His playing of 4 characters was recorded and later processed into animation through \"motion capture\" technique. The film was directed by [[Shinji Aramaki]], and was released in 2004 globally.\n \nShibuya had made plans to start performing in China, only deterred by linguistic difficulties. After learning Mandarin in Beijing Language and Culture University for six months, he'd officially started his acting career in Chinese show business world. He starred in his first Chinese TV drama Caoyuanchunlaizao, playing an actual person on history, Shouji Kanai, in autumn 2006.  In the following year, he co-led his first movie in China, Feihuduidiezhan. Directed by Li Shu, this film was the most rebroadcast program of the year, aired by the predominant movie channel in China, CCTV-6. Although still a new face to Chinese audiences, his performances were soon recognized in the industry. Shibuya had been noticed, and would have been picked for a role in his next show by the director, Li Shu, which in turn led to more opportunities to play. Shibuya is grateful for all the support his co-workers have given.\n \nIn 2008, Shibuya played in [[Ip Man (film)]], a kung-fu movie by [[Wilson Yip]], which would win the best film award of 28th Hong Kong Film Awards. Shibuya's role, Colonel Sato, a cold-blooded and crafty villain, not only gained him reputation among professionals, but also made his impression in general public. In fact, the director, Wilson, had half-jokingly warned him to stay away from movie theaters, noticing the excitement of the audience and the success of the film.\n\nShibuya was offered an opportunity to act in his first costume TV drama, Yangguifeimishi, in 2009. Directed by You Xiaogang, starring Yin Tao, Anthony Wong, the show was set in China in the Tang dynasty. Being a foreigner, Shibuya sensed and successfully portrayed his ancient-Chinese character, fascinating thousands of viewers all over China.\n\nIn 2010, Shibuya took a main role in Shenhe, Minetsugu Yoshida, an ornithologist who came to Zhalong Lake to search two lost cranes from Japan. The entire film was shot in [[Qiqihar]], a northeastern city in China where, during the shooting of the film, would reach a temperature of -30\u02daC.  \nShibuya's next TV drama, Jieqiang, was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed. His part, Kato Keiji, an emotional and cunning antagonist, was remarked by critics as both evil and fascinating.<ref name=\"news.163.com\">http://news.163.com/11/0321/03/6VL1HUNP00014AED.html</ref> The program has broken the record of the highest revenue in the history of Chinese TV shows. Participating in such works as Yip Man and Jieqiang, Shibuya certainly became one of the most popular Japanese actors in China. As his works being broadcast in other countries, he gained popularity all over the world.\n\nIn 2011, Shibuya had a chance to play scenes with an Oscar-winner [[Christian Bale]] in [[The Flowers of War]], it was right after the successful TV drama, Jieqiang broadcast, so they gained attention of Chinese media.\n \nTV drama Daxifa\uff08Chinese Traditional Magic\uff09<ref>http://chinesemov.com/tv/2012/Chinese-Traditional-Magic.html</ref>, released in 2012, gave Shibuya a chance to play a complex and unique character. The role of Wutengzhang, Japanese Magician who came to China to steal a secret document of Chinese traditional magic, differs greatly from the soldier roles that Shibuya was used to. As the story progresses, the character adapts various identities such as honest young man, sexy female dancer of kabuki, magician playing magic on the stage, old woman, mad middle aged man. Yet another challenge to Shibuya is to speak Mandarin fluently in all 40 episodes. Overcoming all challenges, Shibuya gained praises for his acting skill and professionalism.\n\nShibuya once again impressed his fans by playing Ichiro Nakamura, the second male leading role in the film Hushed Roar in 2012. Ichiro was a simple-minded person suffered from hypoglycemia, whose marriage with his long-time lover was deterred for his fear of his illness being heredity. This film officially participated in Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival. The character, rich in emotions, was quite a new type for Shibuya to play, as he played numerous stereotypical, sometimes one-sided roles so far. Shibuya spoke only English in the film as required by the setting of the film.   Without knowing him in person, the producer said that Shibuya's playing as a comical role gave her confidence to cast him, and that she was very satisfied with Shibuya's performance.\n\nIn 2013, Shibuya participated in [[Kano (film)|KANO]] as the only Japanese cast from mainland China. The film tells a story about a high school baseball team in Taiwan. [[Umin Boya]], the director, offered the role as he was impressed by Shibuya's performance in Ip Man. Shibuya was also happy to accept his offer not only base on the strength of the script, but also the reputation of the director of being cooperative and accepting to different opinions. Breaking the box office record in Taiwan, the film was also very successful in Japan, Hong Kong and some other countries.  Shibuya appeared in Xiaobaohelaocai in 2013. It was his first opportunity for a comedic role in China which he loves to play. Being busy in Taiwan for shooting KANO at the time, he was able to join for one day shooting in Beijing. The supporting role of colonel Qingtian was a complicating one, despite appearance in few scenes. Colonel Qingtian, who stationed in China In the ending WW\u2161, got desperate as the situation of the war worsen. Knowing he would dispatch from his station the next day, he murdered another character, leading the turn of the plot. His part was insufficient to depict the character's personality, but Shibuya was able to act impromptu and even added humor to it. His performance was praised by both the crew members and the audience. Shibuya had been noted in main cast in spite of his small part.\n\nShibuya continued to expand his range of roles that he could play in China through TV dramas Fenghuoshuangxiong (2013), Youchai (2015) and Tiezaishao (2015).  In Fenghuoshuangxiong, he falls in love with a Japanese girl and losses her at the end of the story;<ref>http://ent.news.cn/2014-09/23/c_127022786.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>http://ent.qq.com/a/20140916/056812.htm</ref> in Youchai, he had a relationship with a Japanese female spy whose death causes his seek to vengeance;<ref>http://ent.163.com/16/0612/18/BPCNET59000333J5.html</ref><ref>http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2016-06/12/content_13471288.htm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> in Tiezaishao, he falls in love with a Chinese girl but is forced to kill her.<ref name=\"ent.qq.com\"/> Through his performance, viewers were able to see different emotions, and carefully shaped personalities, which is rare to see on roles such as Japanese soldiers.\n\nShibuya had more freedom on choosing his future appearance as his fame and wealth increased by 2015. He led in Wanfeng, a graduation project by a group of student in Beijing Film Academy. Shibuya found it interesting to work with students because of their passion and talent, regardless of the budget of the film. He decided to join students\u2019 graduation film; not only to be an actor but also to give advises in all aspects of filmmaking.\n\nShibuya values communication with directors and other crews, leading his repeated collaborations with many directors, including Xiao Feng. They kept in touch since they worked together in Hushed Roar in 2012, and when Xiao Feng directed Air Strike (Dahongzha)<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Strike_(2018_film)</ref> four years later, he entrusted Shibuya with the only Japanese main role. The film was co-produced by Chinese, Korean, and Hollywood teams. Its consultants include Vilmos Zsigmond, Richard Anderson, and Ronald Bass, who are Oscar winners in cinematography, sound effect, and screenplay, respectively, and Mel Gibson participated in this film as an art director.<ref>https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/mel-gibson-china-the-bombing-1201538874/</ref><ref>http://www.thewrap.com/mel-gibson-to-serve-as-art-director-on-bruce-willis-chinese-war-movie-the-bombing/</ref> Telling the story about the Japanese bombings on city of Chongqing during the WW\u2161, the film stars from four countries; Liu Ye from China, Bruce Willis,<ref>https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/bruce-willis-the-bombing-chinese-language-1201511464/</ref> Adrien Brody from the U.S,<ref>http://ent.cntv.cn/2015/11/13/ARTI1447379086038874.shtml</ref> Song Seung-heon from Korea,<ref>http://www.1905.com/news/20150604/897961.shtml?fr=wwwfilm_news_rh_1_20141027</ref> and Shibuya from Japan.<ref>http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20150723/42459337_0.shtml</ref><ref>http://ent.news.cn/2015-07/08/c_127998215.htm</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://ent.qq.com/a/20150715/052057.htm</ref><ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0708/12/AU0J2ER800032DGD.html</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqcj/xfly/2015-07-23/content_14020853.html</ref> Shibuya plays an ace pilot who flies a Zero fighter and battles against Chinese battle-planes. All of the air battle scenes Shibuya acted were taken in the studio of special effect, which would have restricted his acting. Being in the cockpit, he could only act by facial expressions. Furthermore, his acting completely depended on his imagination as there were no opponents or objects in the studio. Shibuya received praises in general despite all the obstacles.\n\nShibuya appeared quite frequently on TV in China in the autumn of 2015. Including re-aired shows, five TV series Shibuya played\uff1bTiezaishao, Ershisidaoguai, Jieqiang, Xuanya, Xuebao, was broadcast on over ten TV channels including Anhui, Beijing, Zhejiang satellite, CCTV-8, Guizhou satellite, Xizang satellite, Shanxi satellite, Anhui satellite, Tianjin satellite.  A number of Shibuya's fans commented and discussed the roles Shibuya portrayed, especially of his new drama, Tiezaishao. They were moved when his passion and sensitivity came to an end when he had to kill the love of his life. Shibuya's performance receives upmost praise for its subtle, complex transition of emotions. Audiences were impressed especially by the compassionate image Shibuya has project, opposed to the usual, monstrous Japanese characters in Chinese productions.\n\nTenma Shibuya also sometimes collaborates with enterprises as an image character or a spokesman. 2013,July, he attended  Art exhibition, \u201cAn honor to meet you.\u201d <ref>http://baike.baidu.com/view/3065850.htm</ref><ref>http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6cac56f70101i1af.html</ref><ref>http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3615019583</ref> 2014, March, he collaborated with Antique jewelry brand, \u201cHouse of Willow.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=http://she.21cn.com/tese/haixiuhui/a/2014/0530/16/27352606_1.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330003224/http://she.21cn.com/tese/haixiuhui/a/2014/0530/16/27352606_1.shtml |archivedate=2017-03-30 }}</ref><ref>http://fashion.ifeng.com/a/20140530/40014486_0.shtml</ref> 2014, May, did a spokesman for Millennium Residences Beijing at the project of \u201cTenma Shibuya\u2019s  Art Space & Art Life Style.\u201d <ref>http://fashion.ifeng.com/a/20140619/40019205_0.shtm</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/micro-reading/dzh/2014-06-19/content_11862681.html</ref> 2015, April, attended \u201cYinluchi Art District Fine Brushwork Exhibition.\u201d<ref>http://www.orgcc.com/news/2015/04/73036.html?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0</ref><ref>http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6cac56f70102vobr.html</ref> 2015, July, participated in Chao Hong's Painting Art Exhibition, \u201cCombining the East and the West,\u201d he had a speech in it.<ref>http://www.orgcc.com/news/2015/07/77140.html</ref><ref name=\"xc27.com\"/> 2015, from June to July, he did a spokesman of African art brand, \u201cAfrican Symbol.\u201d <ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0710/17/AU69C2V400034OGT.html</ref><ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0630/17/ATCHS9FA00034OGT.html</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqcj/xfly/2015-07-29/content_14050252.html</ref><ref>http://news.163.com/15/0715/17/AUJ40M1F00014AED.html</ref><ref>http://www.youngchina.cn/luxury/20150629/48402.html</ref><ref>http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3854487052][http://fun.youth.cn/2015/0715/1482311.shtml{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 2017, February, he collaborated with Fragrance Brand, RE CLASSIFIED at the project of its promotion, \u201c\u201cTenma Shibuya Comprehends Ancient Greek Philosophy through Perfume.\u201d <ref>https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5MDY3ODYwNQ==&mid=2650457471&idx=2&sn=dda86d3fb030313537fb0efc8fbe2d17&pass_ticket=7Yfkk2uKe2LNmPGCrQsiWevVRxCrkIWSw%2BPZtYZYxRU4GNiH9Mx6WAyneNrO6JFp</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e.gmw.cn/2017-02/13/content_23713106.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330011745/http://e.gmw.cn/2017-02/13/content_23713106.htm |archivedate=2017-03-30 }}][http://mini.eastday.com/a/170213182013180.html][{{cite web |url=http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2017-02/13/content_15264807.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330005106/http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2017-02/13/content_15264807.htm |archivedate=2017-03-30 }}</ref>\n\nUp to 2016, Shibuya has appeared in over 100 works including movies, TV dramas and stages in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. Today, he is recognized as one of famous Japanese actors in Chinese speaking regions, especially in mainland China.<ref name=\"xc27.com\"/>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He went to the United States to study at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1989. He got back to Japan in 1991 as his mother died. Preparing to return to the United States again, he suddenly had an accident with his lower back, forcing him to stay until a full recovery, which took him six years. As the backache eased by treatment and therapy, he grew determined to become an actor, at which point he entered acting school.<ref name=\"shijiemingren.com\"/><ref name=\"xc27.com\"/>\n\n==Entertainment career==\nShibuya started his acting career in 1993. Determined to become globally active, he felt the need to accumulate experiences in Japan first until an opportunity occurs. Besides acting on a daily basis, Shibuya further improved his performing skill in various ways, including method acting class taught by Yoko Narahashi who would later become a prominent figure of Japanese film industry at United Performers\u2019Studio which associated with NY Actors Studio, (Method [[Method acting]] later became Shibuya's present basic style of acting) ; film acting classes at Eizoujuku, a professional film college founded by Genji Nakamura, director of over 40 films; Japanese classical dancing class from Nishikawa\u2019 Kazuma, the master of Nishikawa school; vocal training at AK MUSIC specializing in opera, chanson and pop music. Shibuya acted in a number of independent and short films, in addition to his guest appearances for various film productions, which familiarized him with their methods and styles. Meanwhile, he had also taken part in filmmaking. He would even sing his original songs while playing guitar. Shibuya sought improvement day and night.\n \nShibuya's commercial debut was in Sadistic Song (1995), a film directed by Genji Nakamura. And in 1997 comes theatric opportunities for Shibuya. In March, he participated in Bolero, a famous ballet work. The performance was choreographed by Maurice B\u00e9jart, directed by Shiro Mizoshita of Tokyo Ballet, as one of dance ensembles presented at Tokyo culture hall. In July, he took parts in Princess Sayo, as both a character and Japanese folk dancer. In August 1997, Shibuya served as assistant director in Annie Get Your Gun, a famous Broadway musical, in Nagoya Chunichi Theater. In the next year, he had the longed opportunity to work with a famous theatric director. He passed the audition and played Capulet in Romeo and Juliet, as directed by [[Yukio Ninagawa]]. He kept at his cinematic career nonetheless. In 2001, Shibuya got a role in Agitator, a film by [[Takashi Miike]], prolific filmmaker. He played a member of the Mafia, who would support his leader played by [[Naoto Takenaka]]. Shibuya was only able to play small bits as detective, gangster, doctor, lawyer during this period. Shibuya's first experience with computer-generated animation was in ''[[Appleseed (2004 film)|Appleseed]]''. His playing of 4 characters was recorded and later processed into animation through \"motion capture\" technique. The film was directed by [[Shinji Aramaki]], and was released in 2004 globally.\n \nShibuya had made plans to start performing in China, only deterred by linguistic difficulties. After learning Mandarin in Beijing Language and Culture University for six months, he'd officially started his acting career in Chinese show business world. He starred in his first Chinese TV drama Caoyuanchunlaizao, playing an actual person on history, Shouji Kanai, in autumn 2006.  In the following year, he co-led his first movie in China, Feihuduidiezhan. Directed by Li Shu, this film was the most rebroadcast program of the year, aired by the predominant movie channel in China, CCTV-6. Although still a new face to Chinese audiences, his performances were soon recognized in the industry. Shibuya had been noticed, and would have been picked for a role in his next show by the director, Li Shu, which in turn led to more opportunities to play. Shibuya is grateful for all the support his co-workers have given.\n \nIn 2008, Shibuya played in [[Ip Man (film)]], a kung-fu movie by [[Wilson Yip]], which would win the best film award of 28th Hong Kong Film Awards. Shibuya's role, Colonel Sato, a cold-blooded and crafty villain, not only gained him reputation among professionals, but also made his impression in general public. In fact, the director, Wilson, had half-jokingly warned him to stay away from movie theaters, noticing the excitement of the audience and the success of the film.\n\nShibuya was offered an opportunity to act in his first costume TV drama, Yangguifeimishi, in 2009. Directed by You Xiaogang, starring Yin Tao, Anthony Wong, the show was set in China in the Tang dynasty. Being a foreigner, Shibuya sensed and successfully portrayed his ancient-Chinese character, fascinating thousands of viewers all over China.\n\nIn 2010, Shibuya took a main role in Shenhe, Minetsugu Yoshida, an ornithologist who came to Zhalong Lake to search two lost cranes from Japan. The entire film was shot in [[Qiqihar]], a northeastern city in China where, during the shooting of the film, would reach a temperature of -30\u02daC.  \nShibuya's next TV drama, Jieqiang, was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed. His part, Kato Keiji, an emotional and cunning antagonist, was remarked by critics as both evil and fascinating.<ref name=\"news.163.com\">http://news.163.com/11/0321/03/6VL1HUNP00014AED.html</ref> The program has broken the record of the highest revenue in the history of Chinese TV shows. Participating in such works as Yip Man and Jieqiang, Shibuya certainly became one of the most popular Japanese actors in China. As his works being broadcast in other countries, he gained popularity all over the world.\n\nIn 2011, Shibuya had a chance to play scenes with an Oscar-winner [[Christian Bale]] in [[The Flowers of War]], it was right after the successful TV drama, Jieqiang broadcast, so they gained attention of Chinese media.\n \nTV drama Daxifa\uff08Chinese Traditional Magic\uff09<ref>http://chinesemov.com/tv/2012/Chinese-Traditional-Magic.html</ref>, released in 2012, gave Shibuya a chance to play a complex and unique character. The role of Wutengzhang, Japanese Magician who came to China to steal a secret document of Chinese traditional magic, differs greatly from the soldier roles that Shibuya was used to. As the story progresses, the character adapts various identities such as honest young man, sexy female dancer of kabuki, magician playing magic on the stage, old woman, mad middle aged man. Yet another challenge to Shibuya is to speak Mandarin fluently in all 40 episodes. Overcoming all challenges, Shibuya gained praises for his acting skill and professionalism.\n\nShibuya once again impressed his fans by playing Ichiro Nakamura, the second male leading role in the film Hushed Roar in 2012. Ichiro was a simple-minded person suffered from hypoglycemia, whose marriage with his long-time lover was deterred for his fear of his illness being heredity. This film officially participated in Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival. The character, rich in emotions, was quite a new type for Shibuya to play, as he played numerous stereotypical, sometimes one-sided roles so far. Shibuya spoke only English in the film as required by the setting of the film.   Without knowing him in person, the producer said that Shibuya's playing as a comical role gave her confidence to cast him, and that she was very satisfied with Shibuya's performance.\n\nIn 2013, Shibuya participated in [[Kano (film)|KANO]] as the only Japanese cast from mainland China. The film tells a story about a high school baseball team in Taiwan. [[Umin Boya]], the director, offered the role as he was impressed by Shibuya's performance in Ip Man. Shibuya was also happy to accept his offer not only base on the strength of the script, but also the reputation of the director of being cooperative and accepting to different opinions. Breaking the box office record in Taiwan, the film was also very successful in Japan, Hong Kong and some other countries.  Shibuya appeared in Xiaobaohelaocai in 2013. It was his first opportunity for a comedic role in China which he loves to play. Being busy in Taiwan for shooting KANO at the time, he was able to join for one day shooting in Beijing. The supporting role of colonel Qingtian was a complicating one, despite appearance in few scenes. Colonel Qingtian, who stationed in China In the ending WW\u2161, got desperate as the situation of the war worsen. Knowing he would dispatch from his station the next day, he murdered another character, leading the turn of the plot. His part was insufficient to depict the character's personality, but Shibuya was able to act impromptu and even added humor to it. His performance was praised by both the crew members and the audience. Shibuya had been noted in main cast in spite of his small part.\n\nShibuya continued to expand his range of roles that he could play in China through TV dramas Fenghuoshuangxiong (2013), Youchai (2015) and Tiezaishao (2015).  In Fenghuoshuangxiong, he falls in love with a Japanese girl and losses her at the end of the story;<ref>http://ent.news.cn/2014-09/23/c_127022786.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>http://ent.qq.com/a/20140916/056812.htm</ref> in Youchai, he had a relationship with a Japanese female spy whose death causes his seek to vengeance;<ref>http://ent.163.com/16/0612/18/BPCNET59000333J5.html</ref><ref>http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2016-06/12/content_13471288.htm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> in Tiezaishao, he falls in love with a Chinese girl but is forced to kill her.<ref name=\"ent.qq.com\"/> Through his performance, viewers were able to see different emotions, and carefully shaped personalities, which is rare to see on roles such as Japanese soldiers.\n\nShibuya had more freedom on choosing his future appearance as his fame and wealth increased by 2015. He led in Wanfeng, a graduation project by a group of student in Beijing Film Academy. Shibuya found it interesting to work with students because of their passion and talent, regardless of the budget of the film. He decided to join students\u2019 graduation film; not only to be an actor but also to give advises in all aspects of filmmaking.\n\nShibuya values communication with directors and other crews, leading his repeated collaborations with many directors, including Xiao Feng. They kept in touch since they worked together in Hushed Roar in 2012, and when Xiao Feng directed Air Strike (Dahongzha)<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Strike_(2018_film)</ref> four years later, he entrusted Shibuya with the only Japanese main role. The film was co-produced by Chinese, Korean, and Hollywood teams. Its consultants include Vilmos Zsigmond, Richard Anderson, and Ronald Bass, who are Oscar winners in cinematography, sound effect, and screenplay, respectively, and Mel Gibson participated in this film as an art director.<ref>https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/mel-gibson-china-the-bombing-1201538874/</ref><ref>http://www.thewrap.com/mel-gibson-to-serve-as-art-director-on-bruce-willis-chinese-war-movie-the-bombing/</ref> Telling the story about the Japanese bombings on city of Chongqing during the WW\u2161, the film stars from four countries; Liu Ye from China, Bruce Willis,<ref>https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/bruce-willis-the-bombing-chinese-language-1201511464/</ref> Adrien Brody from the U.S,<ref>http://ent.cntv.cn/2015/11/13/ARTI1447379086038874.shtml</ref> Song Seung-heon from Korea,<ref>http://www.1905.com/news/20150604/897961.shtml?fr=wwwfilm_news_rh_1_20141027</ref> and Shibuya from Japan.<ref>http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20150723/42459337_0.shtml</ref><ref>http://ent.news.cn/2015-07/08/c_127998215.htm</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://ent.qq.com/a/20150715/052057.htm</ref><ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0708/12/AU0J2ER800032DGD.html</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqcj/xfly/2015-07-23/content_14020853.html</ref> Shibuya plays an ace pilot who flies a Zero fighter and battles against Chinese battle-planes. All of the air battle scenes Shibuya acted were taken in the studio of special effect, which would have restricted his acting. Being in the cockpit, he could only act by facial expressions. Furthermore, his acting completely depended on his imagination as there were no opponents or objects in the studio. Shibuya received praises in general despite all the obstacles.\n\nShibuya appeared quite frequently on TV in China in the autumn of 2015. Including re-aired shows, five TV series Shibuya played\uff1bTiezaishao, Ershisidaoguai, Jieqiang, Xuanya, Xuebao, was broadcast on over ten TV channels including Anhui, Beijing, Zhejiang satellite, CCTV-8, Guizhou satellite, Xizang satellite, Shanxi satellite, Anhui satellite, Tianjin satellite.  A number of Shibuya's fans commented and discussed the roles Shibuya portrayed, especially of his new drama, Tiezaishao. They were moved when his passion and sensitivity came to an end when he had to kill the love of his life. Shibuya's performance receives upmost praise for its subtle, complex transition of emotions.

Some cultures have been described as [[sexually repressive]]. The study of sexuality also includes [[Individual|human identity]] within social groups, [[Sexually transmitted diseases|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), and [[birth control]] methods.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Development==\n===Sexual orientation===\n{{Main|Sexual orientation}}\n\nThere is considerably more evidence supporting innate causes of sexual orientation than learned ones, especially for males. This evidence includes the cross-cultural correlation of homosexuality and childhood [[gender nonconformity]], moderate genetic influences found in [[twin studies]], evidence for prenatal hormonal effects on brain organization, the fraternal birth order effect, and the finding that in rare cases where infant males were raised as girls due to physical deformity, they nevertheless turned out attracted to females. Hypothesized social causes are supported by only weak evidence, distorted by numerous confounding factors.<ref name=Bailey16 /> Cross-cultural evidence also leans more toward non-social causes. Cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it. Homosexual behavior is relatively common among boys in British single-sex boarding schools, but adult Britons who attended such schools are no more likely to engage in homosexual behavior than those who did not. In an extreme case, the [[Sambia people]] ritually require their boys to engage in homosexual behavior during adolescence before they have any access to females, yet most of these boys become heterosexual.<ref name=LeVay/><ref name=Balthazart/>\n\nIt is not fully understood why genes causing homosexuality persist in the gene pool. One hypothesis involves [[kin selection]], suggesting that homosexuals invest heavily enough in their relatives to offset the cost of not reproducing as much directly. This has not been supported by studies in Western cultures, but several studies in [[Samoa]] have found some support for this hypothesis. Another hypothesis involves [[Sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic]] genes, which cause homosexuality when expressed in males but increase reproduction when expressed in females. Studies in both Western and non-Western cultures have found support for this hypothesis.<ref name=Bailey16/><ref name=BussCh5>{{cite book |last=Buss |first=David |date=2019 |title=Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind |chapter=Men's Long-Term Mating Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn6JDwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780429590061 }}</ref>\n\n===Gender differences===\n{{see also|Sex differences in psychology#Sexual behavior}}\n\nPsychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them (including [[neo-analytic]] theories, [[sociobiological]] theories, [[social learning theory]], [[social role theory]], and [[script theory]]) agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as [[marriage]]) and should also be more [[promiscuous]] (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States. Other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of [[oral sex]], and attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females.<ref name=\"Oliver & Hyde\">{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Mary Beth |last2=Hyde |first2=Janet S. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84169-019-3 |pages=29\u201343 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&pg=PA29 |chapter=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis}}</ref>\n\n==Biological and physiological aspects==\n{{main|Human reproductive system}}\nLike other [[mammal]]s, humans are primarily grouped into either the [[male]] or [[female]] sex,<ref name=\"Leonard2010\">{{cite book | last =Leonard | first =Janet | authorlink =Janet L.

The third, called the [[corpus spongiosum]], is a tube that lies centrally beneath the others and expands at the end to form the tip of the penis (glans).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.innerbody.com/image/repmov.html |title=Male Reproductive System \u2013 Explore Anatomy with Detailed Pictures |publisher=Innerbody.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe raised rim at the border of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra runs through the shaft, providing an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]] and the [[ischiocavernosus muscle]], which aid urination and ejaculation.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries are the female gonads; they develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[Luteinizing Hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation. On day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Sexual response cycle===\nThe sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refactory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina.  The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health \"Sexual Response\" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Koedt70\">{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |accessdate = 18 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archivedate = 19 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===\n{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}\nSexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty.

Sigmund Freud was one of the first researchers to take child sexuality seriously. His ideas, such as psychosexual development and the Oedipus conflict, have been much debated but acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was an important development.<ref name=\"Santrock, J.W. 2008\">Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Freud gave sexual drives an importance and centrality in human life, actions, and behavior; he said sexual drives exist and can be discerned in children from birth. He explains this in his theory of [[infantile sexuality]], and says sexual energy ([[libido]]) is the most important motivating force in adult life. Freud wrote about the importance of interpersonal relationships to one's sexual and emotional development. From birth, the mother's connection to the infant affects the infant's later capacity for pleasure and [[attachment theory|attachment]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bretherton | first1 = Inge | year = 1992 | title = The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth | url = http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1LQX400NM-RBVKH9-1KL6/the%20origins%20of%20attachment%20theory%20john%20bowlby%20and%20mary%20ainsworth.pdf | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| page = 759 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}</ref> Freud described two currents of emotional life; an affectionate current, including our bonds with the important people in our lives; and a sensual current, including our wish to gratify sexual impulses.

Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice the differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]], which is often mistaken for masturbation. Child sex play, also known as [[playing doctor]], includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.<ref name=\"Santrock, J.W. 2008\"/> Sex play with others usually decreases as children grow, but they may later possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, but the main surge in sexual interest occurs in adolescence.<ref name=\"Santrock, J.W. 2008\"/>\n\n===Sexuality in late adulthood===\n{{Main|Sexuality in older age}}\nAdult sexuality originates in childhood. However, like many other human capacities, sexuality is not fixed, but matures and develops. A common stereotype associated with old people is that they tend to lose interest and the ability to engage in sexual acts once they reach late adulthood. This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities. Age does not necessarily change the need or desire to be sexually expressive or active. A couple in a long-term relationship may find that the frequency of their sexual activity decreases over time and the type of sexual expression may change, but many couples experience increased intimacy and love.<ref name=jrank>[http://family.jrank.org/pages/1532/Sexuality-in-Adulthood-Aging.html Sexuality in Adulthood \u2013 Aging], JRank Marriage and Family Encyclopedia, Net Industries</ref>\n\n==Sociocultural aspects==\n[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|right|450 px|A [[Second-wave feminism|Women's Liberation]] march in the U.S. Washington, DC, August 1970.

Within these groups, some implications of male dominance existed, but there were signs that women were active participants in sexuality, with bargaining power of their own. These hunter/gatherers had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. H/G groups also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism. Two common tensions in H/G societies are expressed in their art, which emphasizes male sexuality and prowess, with equally common tendencies to blur gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] myth, the Gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOnce agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for [[bestiality]] arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nBefore the [[High Middle Ages]], homosexual acts appear to have been ignored or tolerated by the Christian church.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html |title=Homosexuality and Mental Health |publisher=Psychology.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref> During the 12th century, hostility toward homosexuality began to spread throughout religious and secular institutions.

New, dramatic, artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In Western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; Western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged. There was a new focus on the purpose of marriage; it was increasing regarded as being for love rather than only for economics and reproduction.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n[[Havelock Ellis]] and Sigmund Freud adopted more accepting stances toward homosexuality; Ellis said homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, not a disease, and that many homosexuals made significant contributions to society.<ref name=\"psychology.ucdavis.edu\"/> Freud wrote that all human beings as capable of becoming either heterosexual or homosexual; neither orientation was assumed to be innate.<ref name=\"King, B. 2009\">{{cite book | author = King, Bruce M. | year = 2009 | title = Human Sexuality Today | edition = 6th | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ| publisher = Pearson Education | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to Freud, a person's orientation depended on the resolution of the Oedipus complex.

He collected data from questionnaires given to his students at [[Indiana University]], but then switched to personal interviews about sexual behaviors. Kinsey and his colleagues sampled 5,300 men and 5,940 women. He found that most people masturbated, that many engaged in [[oral sex]], that women are capable of having multiple orgasms, and that many men had had some type of homosexual experience in their lifetimes.

Although opinions varied on when birth control should be available to women, by 1938, there were 347 birth control clinics in the United States but advertising their services remained illegal. The stigma continued to lose credibility as First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly showed her support for birth control through the four terms her husband served (1933\u20131945). However, it was not until 1966 that the Federal Government began to fund family planning and subsidized birth control services for lower-class women and families at the order of President Lyndon B.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness, and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. In addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic).

The \"black letter\" approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent, and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/> In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/>\n\nIssues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation have come to the forefront in Western law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to \"[[come out of the closet]]\" and engaging with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts.<ref name=Minnesota1>{{cite web|title=Researching Legal Issues of Sexual Orientation|url=https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|website=library.law.umn.edu|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=3 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012329/https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|archivedate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Sexual privacy====\n{{See also|Sexual and reproductive health and rights}}\nWhile the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nState intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nThe legal systems surrounding [[prostitution]] are a topic of debate. Proponents for criminalization argue that sex work is an immoral practice that should not be tolerated, while proponents for decriminalization point out how criminalization does more harm than good. Within the feminist movement, there is also a debate over whether sex work is inherently objectifying and exploitative or whether sex workers have the agency to sell sex as a service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/kate-heartfield-do-prostitutes-sell-themselves-or-a-service-1.877652|title=Kate Heartfield: Do prostitutes sell themselves or a service?|last=Heartfield|first=Kate|website=Times Colonist|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen sex work is criminalized, sex workers do not have support from law enforcement when they fall victim to violence. In a 2003 survey of street-based sex workers in NYC, 80% said they had been threatened with or experienced violence, and many said the police were no help. 27% said they had experienced violence from police officers themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoor.pdf|title=Revolving Door|last=Thukral|first=Juhu|date=2003|website=Sex Workers Project|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103043554/http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoor.pdf|archive-date=2004-01-03}}</ref> Different identities such as being black, transgender, or poor can result in a person being more likely to be criminally profiled by the police.

In others it is treated as primarily physical. Some hold that sexual behavior is only spiritual within certain kinds of relationships, when used for specific purposes, or when incorporated into religious ritual. In some religions there are no distinctions between the physical and the spiritual, whereas some religions view human sexuality as a way of completing the gap that exists between the spiritual and the physical.<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and Sexuality|url=http://www.iwgonline.org/sexuality/|publisher=Interfaith Working Group|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nMany religious conservatives, especially those of [[Abrahamic religions]] and [[Christianity]] in particular, tend to view sexuality in terms of behavior (''i.e.'' homosexuality or heterosexuality is what someone does) and certain sexualities such as [[bisexuality]] tend to be ignored as a result of this.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} These conservatives tend to promote [[celibacy]] for gay people, and may also tend to believe that sexuality can be changed through [[conversion therapy]]<ref name=Tolerance111>{{cite web | title= Two Definitions and Six Interpretations | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom6beli.htm | website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> or [[prayer]] to become an [[ex-gay]].

For this reason, all sexual activity must occur in the context of a marriage between a man and a woman, and must not be divorced from the possibility of conception.

It also views singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like. It states that people with same sex attraction are loved by God and are welcomed as full members of the [[Body of Christ]], while the Church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful including \"promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision\".

Marriage is considered to be a good deed; it does not hinder spiritual wayfaring. The term used for marriage within the [[Quran]] is ''nikah'', which literally means sexual intercourse. Although Islamic sexuality is restrained via [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]], it emphasizes sexual pleasure within marriage. It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, but he must take care of those wives physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually.<ref>{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | title = Major Patterns of Change and Continuity: World History in Brief | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} Muslims believe that sexual intercourse is an act of worship that fulfils emotional and physical needs, and that producing children is one way in which humans can contribute to God's creation, and Islam discourages celibacy once an individual is married.

This evidence includes the cross-cultural correlation of homosexuality and childhood [[gender nonconformity]], moderate genetic influences found in [[twin studies]], evidence for prenatal hormonal effects on brain organization, the fraternal birth order effect, and the finding that in rare cases where infant males were raised as girls due to physical deformity, they nevertheless turned out attracted to females. Hypothesized social causes are supported by only weak evidence, distorted by numerous confounding factors.<ref name=Bailey16 /> Cross-cultural evidence also leans more toward non-social causes. Cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it. Homosexual behavior is relatively common among boys in British single-sex boarding schools, but adult Britons who attended such schools are no more likely to engage in homosexual behavior than those who did not. In an extreme case, the [[Sambia people]] ritually require their boys to engage in homosexual behavior during adolescence before they have any access to females, yet most of these boys become heterosexual.<ref name=LeVay/><ref name=Balthazart/>\n\nIt is not fully understood why genes causing homosexuality persist in the gene pool. One hypothesis involves [[kin selection]], suggesting that homosexuals invest heavily enough in their relatives to offset the cost of not reproducing as much directly. This has not been supported by studies in Western cultures, but several studies in [[Samoa]] have found some support for this hypothesis. Another hypothesis involves [[Sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic]] genes, which cause homosexuality when expressed in males but increase reproduction when expressed in females. Studies in both Western and non-Western cultures have found support for this hypothesis.<ref name=Bailey16/><ref name=BussCh5>{{cite book |last=Buss |first=David |date=2019 |title=Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind |chapter=Men's Long-Term Mating Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn6JDwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780429590061 }}</ref>\n\n===Gender differences===\n{{see also|Sex differences in psychology#Sexual behavior}}\n\nPsychological theories exist regarding the development and expression of gender differences in human sexuality. A number of them (including [[neo-analytic]] theories, [[sociobiological]] theories, [[social learning theory]], [[social role theory]], and [[script theory]]) agree in predicting that men should be more approving of casual sex (sex happening outside a stable, committed relationship such as [[marriage]]) and should also be more [[promiscuous]] (have a higher number of sexual partners) than women. These theories are mostly consistent with observed differences in males' and females' attitudes toward casual sex before marriage in the United States. Other aspects of human sexuality, such as sexual satisfaction, incidence of [[oral sex]], and attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] and [[masturbation]], show little to no observed difference between males and females. Observed gender differences regarding the number of sexual partners are modest, with males tending to have slightly more than females.<ref name=\"Oliver & Hyde\">{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Mary Beth |last2=Hyde |first2=Janet S. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F. |title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings |date=2001 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-84169-019-3 |pages=29\u201343 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qsKNaqIsuUC&pg=PA29 |chapter=Gender Differences in Sexuality: A Meta-Analysis}}</ref>\n\n==Biological and physiological aspects==\n{{main|Human reproductive system}}\nLike other [[mammal]]s, humans are primarily grouped into either the [[male]] or [[female]] sex,<ref name=\"Leonard2010\">{{cite book | last =Leonard | first =Janet | authorlink =Janet L.

The urethra runs through the shaft, providing an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the [[bulbocavernosus muscle]] and the [[ischiocavernosus muscle]], which aid urination and ejaculation.

It is usually positioned in a 90-degree angle tilting forward, although in about 20% of women it tilts backwards.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/> The uterus has three layers; the innermost layer is the [[endometrium]], where the egg is implanted. During ovulation, this thickens for implantation. If implantation does not occur, it is sloughed off during menstruation. The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus. The broad part of the uterus is the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDuring [[ovulation]], the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. These extend about {{convert|4|inch|cm|spell=in}} from both sides of the uterus. Finger-like projections at the ends of the tubes brush the ovaries and receive the ovum once it is released. The ovum then travels for three to four days to the uterus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} After sexual intercourse, sperm swim up this funnel from the uterus. The lining of the tube and its secretions sustain the egg and the sperm, encouraging [[fertilization]] and nourishing the ovum until it reaches the uterus. If the ovum divides after fertilization, [[identical twins]] are produced. If separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm, the mother gives birth to non-identical or [[fraternal twins]].<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nThe ovaries are the female gonads; they develop from the same embryonic tissue as the [[testicles]]. The ovaries are suspended by ligaments and are the source where ova are stored and developed before ovulation. The ovaries also produce female hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]]. Within the ovaries, each ovum is surrounded by other cells and contained within a capsule called a primary follicle. At puberty, one or more of these follicles are stimulated to mature on a monthly basis. Once matured, these are called [[Graafian follicles]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}} The female reproductive system does not produce the ova; about 60,000 ova are present at birth, only 400 of which will mature during the woman's lifetime.<ref name=\"innerbody.com\"/>\n\nOvulation is based on a monthly cycle; the 14th day is the most fertile. On days one to four, menstruation and production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, and the endometrium starts thinning. The endometrium is sloughed off for the next three to six days. Once menstruation ends, the cycle begins again with an FSH surge from the pituitary gland. Days five to thirteen are known as the pre-ovulatory stage. During this stage, the pituitary gland secretes [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). A negative feedback loop is enacted when estrogen is secreted to inhibit the release of FSH. Estrogen thickens the endometrium of the uterus. A surge of [[Luteinizing Hormone]] (LH) triggers ovulation. On day 14, the LH surge causes a Graafian follicle to surface the ovary. The follicle ruptures and the ripe ovum is expelled into the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tubes pick up the ovum with the [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbria]]. The cervical mucus changes to aid the movement of sperm. On days 15 to 28\u2014the post-ovulatory stage, the Graafian follicle\u2014now called the [[corpus luteum]]\u2014secretes estrogen. Production of progesterone increases, inhibiting LH release. The endometrium thickens to prepare for implantation, and the ovum travels down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. If the ovum is not fertilized and does not implant, menstruation begins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Sexual response cycle===\nThe sexual response cycle is a model that describes the physiological responses that occur during sexual activity. This model was created by [[William Masters]] and [[Virginia E. Johnson|Virginia Johnson]]. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases; excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, also called the EPOR model. During the excitement phase of the EPOR model, one attains the intrinsic motivation to have sex. The plateau phase is the precursor to orgasm, which may be mostly biological for men and mostly psychological for women. Orgasm is the release of tension, and the resolution period is the unaroused state before the cycle begins again.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe male sexual response cycle starts in the excitement phase; two centers in the spine are responsible for erections. Vasoconstriction in the penis begins, the heart rate increases, the scrotum thickens, the spermatic cord shortens, and the testicles become engorged with blood. In the plateau phase, the penis increases in diameter, the testicles become more engorged, and the Cowper's glands secrete pre-seminal fluid. The orgasm phase, during which rhythmic contractions occur every 0.8 seconds{{Verify source|date=May 2012}}, consists of two phases; the emission phase, in which contractions of the vas deferens, prostate, and seminal vesicles encourage ejaculation, which is the second phase of orgasm. Ejaculation is called the expulsion phase; it cannot be reached without an orgasm. In the resolution phase, the male is now in an unaroused state consisting of a [[Refractory period (sex)|refactory (rest) period]] before the cycle can begin. This rest period may increase with age.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe female sexual response begins with the excitement phase, which can last from several minutes to several hours. Characteristics of this phase include increased heart and respiratory rate, and an elevation of blood pressure. Flushed skin or blotches of redness may occur on the chest and back; breasts increase slightly in size and nipples may become hardened and erect. The onset of [[vasocongestion]] results in swelling of the clitoris, labia minora, and vagina.  The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening tightens and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating liquid. The second phase, called the plateau phase, is characterized primarily by the intensification of the changes begun during the excitement phase. The plateau phase extends to the brink of orgasm, which initiates the resolution stage; the reversal of the changes begun during the excitement phase. During the orgasm stage the heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and breathing rates peak. The pelvic muscle near the vagina, the anal sphincter, and the uterus contract. Muscle contractions in the vaginal area create a high level of pleasure, though all orgasms are centered in the clitoris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Intimacy |first=Sinclair |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/sexual-response-dictionary1.htm |title=Discovery Health \"Sexual Response\" |publisher=Health.howstuffworks.com |date=25 April 2005 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proplusmedical.com/pages.html?pages_id=8 |title=Female Sexual Response Cycle |publisher=Proplusmedical.com |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Koedt70\">{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |accessdate = 18 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819232224/http://www.cwluherstory.org/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm.html |archivedate = 19 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Sexual dysfunction and sexual problems===\n{{main|Sexual dysfunction}}\nSexual disorders, according to the DSM-IV-TR, are disturbances in sexual desire and psycho-physiological changes that characterize the sexual response cycle and cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty.

Arousal disorder means lack of vaginal lubrication. In addition, blood flow problems may affect arousal disorder. Lack of orgasm, also known as, anorgasmia is another sexual dysfunction in women. The anorgasmia occurs in women with psychological disorders such as guilt and anxiety that was caused by sexual assault. The last sexual disorder is the painful intercourse. The sexual disorder can be result of pelvic mass, scar tissue, sexually transmitted disease and more.<ref>{{cite web|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction|url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/sexual-dysfunction-women?page=2|website=www.webmd.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\nThere are also three common sexual disorders for men including, sexual desire, ejaculation disorder, and erectile dysfunction.

Sigmund Freud was one of the first researchers to take child sexuality seriously. His ideas, such as psychosexual development and the Oedipus conflict, have been much debated but acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was an important development.<ref name=\"Santrock, J.W. 2008\">Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Freud gave sexual drives an importance and centrality in human life, actions, and behavior; he said sexual drives exist and can be discerned in children from birth. He explains this in his theory of [[infantile sexuality]], and says sexual energy ([[libido]]) is the most important motivating force in adult life. Freud wrote about the importance of interpersonal relationships to one's sexual and emotional development. From birth, the mother's connection to the infant affects the infant's later capacity for pleasure and [[attachment theory|attachment]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bretherton | first1 = Inge | year = 1992 | title = The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth | url = http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1LQX400NM-RBVKH9-1KL6/the%20origins%20of%20attachment%20theory%20john%20bowlby%20and%20mary%20ainsworth.pdf | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| page = 759 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}</ref> Freud described two currents of emotional life; an affectionate current, including our bonds with the important people in our lives; and a sensual current, including our wish to gratify sexual impulses.

Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice the differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]], which is often mistaken for masturbation. Child sex play, also known as [[playing doctor]], includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.<ref name=\"Santrock, J.W. 2008\"/> Sex play with others usually decreases as children grow, but they may later possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, but the main surge in sexual interest occurs in adolescence.<ref name=\"Santrock, J.W. 2008\"/>\n\n===Sexuality in late adulthood===\n{{Main|Sexuality in older age}}\nAdult sexuality originates in childhood. However, like many other human capacities, sexuality is not fixed, but matures and develops. A common stereotype associated with old people is that they tend to lose interest and the ability to engage in sexual acts once they reach late adulthood. This misconception is reinforced by Western popular culture, which often ridicules older adults who try to engage in sexual activities. Age does not necessarily change the need or desire to be sexually expressive or active. A couple in a long-term relationship may find that the frequency of their sexual activity decreases over time and the type of sexual expression may change, but many couples experience increased intimacy and love.<ref name=jrank>[http://family.jrank.org/pages/1532/Sexuality-in-Adulthood-Aging.html Sexuality in Adulthood \u2013 Aging], JRank Marriage and Family Encyclopedia, Net Industries</ref>\n\n==Sociocultural aspects==\n[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|right|450 px|A [[Second-wave feminism|Women's Liberation]] march in the U.S. Washington, DC, August 1970.

Within these groups, some implications of male dominance existed, but there were signs that women were active participants in sexuality, with bargaining power of their own. These hunter/gatherers had less restrictive sexual standards that emphasized sexual pleasure and enjoyment, but with definite rules and constraints. Some underlying continuities or key regulatory standards contended with the tension between recognition of pleasure, interest, and the need to procreate for the sake of social order and economic survival. H/G groups also placed high value on certain types of sexual symbolism. Two common tensions in H/G societies are expressed in their art, which emphasizes male sexuality and prowess, with equally common tendencies to blur gender lines in sexual matters. One example of these male-dominated portrayals is the [[Egyptian creation myth]], in which the sun god [[Atum]] masturbates in the water, creating the [[Nile River]]. In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] myth, the Gods' semen filled the [[Tigris]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOnce agricultural societies emerged, the sexual framework shifted in ways that persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, determination of children's paternity became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for [[bestiality]] arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality.

New, dramatic, artificial birth control devices such as the [[condom]] and [[diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] were introduced. Doctors started claiming a new role in sexual matters, urging that their advice was crucial to sexual morality and health. New pornographic industries grew and Japan adopted its first laws against homosexuality. In Western societies, the definition of homosexuality was constantly changing; Western influence on other cultures became more prevalent. New contacts created serious issues around sexuality and sexual traditions. There were also major shifts in sexual behavior. During this period, puberty began occurring at younger ages, so a new focus on adolescence as a time of sexual confusion and danger emerged.

This may be for companionship, procreation, or an intimate relationship. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting one or more partners and maintaining sexual interest, can include:\n* [[Flirting]], the attraction of the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations. It can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.<ref>[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting.

The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context in which they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume, [[long hair|hair length]] and [[hair style|style]], and anything else which can attract the sexual interest of another person. It can also be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities of the person. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and also on the criteria of the person who is attracted.\n\nThough attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness, and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. In addition, there are [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, who usually do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic). [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].<ref>Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S.

The \"black letter\" approach to law focuses on the study of pre-existing legal precedent, and attempts to offer a clear framework of rules within which lawyers and others can work.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/> In contrast, the socio-legal approach focuses more broadly on the relationship between the law and society, and offers a more contextualized view of the relationship between legal and social change.<ref name=SexualityLaw1/>\n\nIssues regarding human sexuality and human sexual orientation have come to the forefront in Western law in the latter half of the twentieth century, as part of the [[gay liberation]] movement's encouragement of LGBT individuals to \"[[come out of the closet]]\" and engaging with the legal system, primarily through courts. Therefore, many issues regarding human sexuality and the law are found in the opinions of the courts.<ref name=Minnesota1>{{cite web|title=Researching Legal Issues of Sexual Orientation|url=https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|website=library.law.umn.edu|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=3 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012329/https://library.law.umn.edu/researchguides/sexual-orientation.html|archivedate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Sexual privacy====\n{{See also|Sexual and reproductive health and rights}}\nWhile the issue of privacy has been useful to sexual rights claims, some scholars have criticized its usefulness, saying that this perspective is too narrow and restrictive. The law is often slow to intervene in certain forms of coercive behavior that can limit individuals' control over their own sexuality (such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriages]] or lack of access to reproductive health care). Many of these injustices are often perpetuated wholly or in part by private individuals rather than state agents, and as a result, there is an ongoing debate about the extent of state responsibility to prevent harmful practices and to investigate such practices when they do occur.<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nState intervention with regards to sexuality also occurs, and is considered acceptable by some, in certain instances (e.g. same-sex sexual activity or [[prostitution]]).<ref name=SexualityLaw1 />\n\nThe legal systems surrounding [[prostitution]] are a topic of debate. Proponents for criminalization argue that sex work is an immoral practice that should not be tolerated, while proponents for decriminalization point out how criminalization does more harm than good. Within the feminist movement, there is also a debate over whether sex work is inherently objectifying and exploitative or whether sex workers have the agency to sell sex as a service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/kate-heartfield-do-prostitutes-sell-themselves-or-a-service-1.877652|title=Kate Heartfield: Do prostitutes sell themselves or a service?|last=Heartfield|first=Kate|website=Times Colonist|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen sex work is criminalized, sex workers do not have support from law enforcement when they fall victim to violence. In a 2003 survey of street-based sex workers in NYC, 80% said they had been threatened with or experienced violence, and many said the police were no help. 27% said they had experienced violence from police officers themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoor.pdf|title=Revolving Door|last=Thukral|first=Juhu|date=2003|website=Sex Workers Project|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103043554/http://sexworkersproject.org/downloads/RevolvingDoor.pdf|archive-date=2004-01-03}}</ref> Different identities such as being black, transgender, or poor can result in a person being more likely to be criminally profiled by the police. For example, in New York, there is a law against \"loitering for the purpose of engaging in prostitution\", which has been nicknamed the \"walking while trans\" law because of how often transgender women are assumed to be sex workers and arrested for simply walking out in public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2019/8/2/20692327/sex-work-decriminalization-prostitution-new-york-dc|title=Sex workers' fight for decriminalization, explained|last=North|first=Anna|date=2 August 2019|website=Vox|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Religious sexual morality==\n{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}\nIn some religions, sexual behavior is regarded as primarily spiritual. In others it is treated as primarily physical. Some hold that sexual behavior is only spiritual within certain kinds of relationships, when used for specific purposes, or when incorporated into religious ritual. In some religions there are no distinctions between the physical and the spiritual, whereas some religions view human sexuality as a way of completing the gap that exists between the spiritual and the physical.<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and Sexuality|url=http://www.iwgonline.org/sexuality/|publisher=Interfaith Working Group|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nMany religious conservatives, especially those of [[Abrahamic religions]] and [[Christianity]] in particular, tend to view sexuality in terms of behavior (''i.e.'' homosexuality or heterosexuality is what someone does) and certain sexualities such as [[bisexuality]] tend to be ignored as a result of this.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} These conservatives tend to promote [[celibacy]] for gay people, and may also tend to believe that sexuality can be changed through [[conversion therapy]]<ref name=Tolerance111>{{cite web | title= Two Definitions and Six Interpretations | url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom6beli.htm | website=religioustolerance.org | accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> or [[prayer]] to become an [[ex-gay]].

They also tend to be more in favor of same-sex marriage.<ref name=Tolerance222 />\n\n===Judaism===\nAccording to [[Judaism]], sex between man and woman within marriage is sacred and should be enjoyed; celibacy is considered sinful.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\n====Roman Catholic Church====\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that sexuality is \"noble and worthy\"<ref>Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today, no. 49: AAS 58 (1966), 1070</ref> but that it must be used in accordance with natural law. For this reason, all sexual activity must occur in the context of a marriage between a man and a woman, and must not be divorced from the possibility of conception. Most forms of sex without the possibility of conception are considered intrinsically disordered and sinful, such as the use of contraceptives, [[masturbation]], and homosexual acts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: The Sixth Commandment|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm|website=vatican.va|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Anglicanism====\nThe [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] teaches that human sexuality is a gift from a loving God designed to be between a man and a woman in a monogamous lifetime union of marriage. It also views singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like. It states that people with same sex attraction are loved by God and are welcomed as full members of the [[Body of Christ]], while the Church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful including \"promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision\".

Marriage is considered to be a good deed; it does not hinder spiritual wayfaring. The term used for marriage within the [[Quran]] is ''nikah'', which literally means sexual intercourse. Although Islamic sexuality is restrained via [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]], it emphasizes sexual pleasure within marriage. It is acceptable for a man to have more than one wife, but he must take care of those wives physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually.<ref>{{cite book | author = Stearns, Peter N. | title = Major Patterns of Change and Continuity: World History in Brief | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} Muslims believe that sexual intercourse is an act of worship that fulfils emotional and physical needs, and that producing children is one way in which humans can contribute to God's creation, and Islam discourages celibacy once an individual is married.

Many scholars wrote ''[[tafsir]]'' (literary critiques) or ''shar\u1e25             '' (commentaries), and it was incorporated in many grammars. Nevertheless, its opacity challenged the best language scholars.

Although he experienced poverty there he attended lectures on syntactic grammar of [[Ibn Barri|Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Abd All\u0101h b. Barr\u012b]] in [[Cairo]] and studied the ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari|\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25]]'' of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b]] with Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u2018Ubayd All\u0101h. In the late 1140s he left Egypt on the [[hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], before returning to the [[Maghreb]].  At [[B\u00e9ja\u00efa]] he lectured on philology, then moved on to [[Algiers]] and taught his ''Q\u0101n\u016bn'' to the grammarian Ab\u016b b. Q\u0101sim b. Mand\u0101s al-[[Ashir|\u0100sh\u012br\u012b]]. He then travelled to [[Almer\u00eda]], in [[Al-Andalus]] (present-day [[Spain]]), to teach for a period.  The ascetic [[Ab\u016b 'l-\u2018Abb\u0101s al-Maghrib\u012b]], made representations to the [[Almohad]] sultan who entrusted al-Jaz\u016bl\u012b with the [[Khutbah|khu\u1e6dba]] at the great mosque at Marrakesh.   As his ''Q\u0101n\u016bn'' became famous and his reputation grew, so students from far and wide came to hear him lecture.  When the mosque where he taught became full to capacity he moved to the Mosque of Ibn al-Abakm, north of Mahallat al-Sharqiyyin, under the passage of the Great Bab Aghmat to the side of Al Awadin.\n\nAl-Jaz\u016bl\u012b died at [[Azemmour]], [[Algeria]], ca. 1211 AD (between 606 and 616 AH).{{sfn|Ibn Qunfudh|1983|p=}}\n\n==His Professors==\n*[[Ibn Barr\u012b]]; who lectured on ''Al-Jumal'' by [[al-Zajj\u0101j\u012b]], ''Al-Kit\u0101b'' by [[Sibawayh|S\u012bbawayh]] and ''Al-U\u1e63\u016bl'' by [[Ibn al-Sarraj]].

The ascetic [[Ab\u016b 'l-\u2018Abb\u0101s al-Maghrib\u012b]], made representations to the [[Almohad]] sultan who entrusted al-Jaz\u016bl\u012b with the [[Khutbah|khu\u1e6dba]] at the great mosque at Marrakesh.   As his ''Q\u0101n\u016bn'' became famous and his reputation grew, so students from far and wide came to hear him lecture.
