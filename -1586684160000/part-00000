It started as a rock opera [[Jesus Christ Superstar (album)|album musical]] before its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on-stage debut in 1971. The musical is [[sung-through]], with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Gospels' accounts]] of the last week of [[Jesus]]' life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his [[Apostle|disciples]]  in Jerusalem and ending with the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between [[Judas Iscariot]] and Jesus that are not present in the [[Bible]].\n\nThe work's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples.\n\nContemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional [[anachronism]]s.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Act I===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT. PLEASE HELP TRIM IT INSTEAD TO MAKE IT MORE CONCISE.-->\n[[Judas Iscariot]], one of the [[12 apostles|Twelve Apostles]], worries that the followers of Jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the [[Roman Empire]], who might harshly suppress them (\"[[Heaven on Their Minds]]\"). The other apostles anticipate going to [[Jerusalem]] with Jesus and ask him about his plans, but Jesus tells them not to worry about the future (\"[[What's the Buzz]]\"). [[Mary Magdalene]] tries to help Jesus relax. Judas tells Jesus that he should not associate with Mary, because a relationship with a prostitute could be seen as inconsistent with his own teachings and be used against him (\"[[Strange Thing Mystifying]]\"). Jesus tells Judas that he should not judge others unless he is without sin. Jesus then reproaches the apostles and complains that none of them truly cares about him. Mary Magdalene tries to reassure Jesus while anointing him with oil (\"[[Everything's Alright (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Everything's Alright]]\"). Judas angrily says that the money spent on oil should have been used to help the poor. Jesus answers that they do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should be glad for what comforts they have.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Caiaphas]], the [[High Priest of Israel]], assembles the [[Pharisees]] and priests. Like Judas they fear that Jesus's followers will be seen as a threat by the Romans, and that many Jews might suffer the consequences. Caiaphas concludes that for the greater good, Jesus must be killed (\"[[This Jesus Must Die]]\"). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus disperse the crowd. Jesus instead greets the happy crowd (\"Hosanna\"). Then [[Simon the Zealot]] suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power. Jesus rejects this, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is (\"[[Simon Zealotes/Poor Jerusalem]]\").\n\n[[Pontius Pilate]], the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets a Galilean and then receives the blame for the man's violent death at the hands of a mob (\"[[Pilate's Dream]]\"). Jesus arrives at the Temple and finds that it is being used as a marketplace; angered by this, he [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives everyone out]] (\"The Temple\"). A group of [[leprosy|lepers]] ask Jesus to heal them. Their number increases, and overwhelmed, Jesus rejects them. Mary Magdalene sings him to sleep. While he sleeps, Mary acknowledges that she is in love with him, and it frightens her (\"[[I Don't Know How to Love Him]]\").\n\nConflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and proposes helping them arrest Jesus, believing that Jesus is out of control and that Jesus himself would approve of his action. In exchange for his help, Judas is offered [[thirty pieces of silver]]. Judas initially refuses, then accepts when Caiaphas suggests that he can use the money to help the poor (\"[[Damned for All Time/Blood Money]]\").\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT. PLEASE HELP TRIM IT INSTEAD TO MAKE IT MORE CONCISE.-->\n\n===Act II===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT. PLEASE HELP TRIM IT INSTEAD TO MAKE IT MORE CONCISE.-->\nAt the [[Last Supper]], Jesus is stung when the others get drunk and pay little attention to him. He remarks that \"for all you care\" the wine they are drinking could be his blood and the bread his body. He asks them to remember him, then frustrated by their lack of understanding, he predicts that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] will [[Denial of Peter|deny him three times]] that night, and that another one of them will betray him. Judas admits that he is the one who will betray Jesus and, saying that he does not understand why Jesus did not plan things better, he leaves (\"The Last Supper\").\n\nThe remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (\"[[Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)]]\"). He tells God his doubts about whether his mission has had any success, and angrily demands to know why he should continue and suffer the horrible death that awaits him. Receiving no answer, he realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God.\n\nJudas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by [[Kiss of Judas|kissing him on the cheek]] (\"The Arrest\"). When Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|brought to trial before the Sanhedrin]], Caiaphas demands to know if he calls himself the Son of God, and Jesus responds merely \"That's what you say\". Caiaphas says that this is sufficient evidence and sends him to Pilate. Meanwhile, Peter is confronted by three people, to whom he denies that he knows Jesus (\"[[Peter's Denial (song)|Peter's Denial]]\"). Mary observes that Jesus had predicted this.\n\nPilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus again answers \"That's what you say\". Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]] (\"[[Pilate and Christ]]\"). The flamboyant King Herod asks Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles (\"[[King Herod's Song]]\"), but Jesus ignores him. Herod angrily sends him back to Pilate. Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace (\"Could We Start Again, Please?\").\n\nJudas is horrified at Jesus's harsh treatment. He expresses regret to the Pharisees, fearing that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that he has done the right thing. Judas throws down the money he was given and storms out. He curses God for manipulating him, and commits suicide (\"Judas's Death\").\n\nAt Jesus's trial, Pilate attempts to interrogate Jesus, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus be [[crucifixion|crucified]].<ref>In the Broadway production, a stanza is added where Pilate admonishes the crowd for their sudden respect for Caesar, as well as for how they \"produce Messiahs by the sackful\"; this was kept for the film and subsequent productions.</ref> He tells the mob that Jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob he will have Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] (\"[[Trial Before Pilate]]\"). Pilate pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God. The crowd still calls for Jesus's death and finally Pilate reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus.\n\nAs Jesus awaits crucifixion, he is haunted by the ghost of Judas, who asks why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan (\"[[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Superstar]]\"). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words and dies (\"The Crucifixion\"). \n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT.

It started as a rock opera [[Jesus Christ Superstar (album)|album musical]] before its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on-stage debut in 1971. The musical is [[sung-through]], with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Gospels' accounts]] of the last week of [[Jesus]]' life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his [[Apostle|disciples]]  in Jerusalem and ending with the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between [[Judas Iscariot]] and Jesus that are not present in the [[Bible]].\n\nThe work's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples.\n\nContemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional [[anachronism]]s.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Act I===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT. PLEASE HELP TRIM IT INSTEAD TO MAKE IT MORE CONCISE.-->\n[[Judas Iscariot]], one of the [[12 apostles|Twelve Apostles]], worries that the followers of Jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the [[Roman Empire]], who might harshly suppress them (\"[[Heaven on Their Minds]]\"). The other apostles anticipate going to [[Jerusalem]] with Jesus and ask him about his plans, but Jesus tells them not to worry about the future (\"[[What's the Buzz]]\"). [[Mary Magdalene]] tries to help Jesus relax. Judas tells Jesus that he should not associate with Mary, because a relationship with a prostitute could be seen as inconsistent with his own teachings and be used against him (\"[[Strange Thing Mystifying]]\"). Jesus tells Judas that he should not judge others unless he is without sin. Jesus then reproaches the apostles and complains that none of them truly cares about him. Mary Magdalene tries to reassure Jesus while anointing him with oil (\"[[Everything's Alright (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Everything's Alright]]\"). Judas angrily says that the money spent on oil should have been used to help the poor. Jesus answers that they do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should be glad for what comforts they have.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Caiaphas]], the [[High Priest of Israel]], assembles the [[Pharisees]] and priests. Like Judas they fear that Jesus's followers will be seen as a threat by the Romans, and that many Jews might suffer the consequences. Caiaphas concludes that for the greater good, Jesus must be killed (\"[[This Jesus Must Die]]\"). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus disperse the crowd. Jesus instead greets the happy crowd (\"Hosanna\"). Then [[Simon the Zealot]] suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power. Jesus rejects this, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is (\"[[Simon Zealotes/Poor Jerusalem]]\").\n\n[[Pontius Pilate]], the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets a Galilean and then receives the blame for the man's violent death at the hands of a mob (\"[[Pilate's Dream]]\"). Jesus arrives at the Temple and finds that it is being used as a marketplace; angered by this, he [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives everyone out]] (\"The Temple\"). A group of [[leprosy|lepers]] ask Jesus to heal them. Their number increases, and overwhelmed, Jesus rejects them. Mary Magdalene sings him to sleep. While he sleeps, Mary acknowledges that she is in love with him, and it frightens her (\"[[I Don't Know How to Love Him]]\").\n\nConflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and proposes helping them arrest Jesus, believing that Jesus is out of control and that Jesus himself would approve of his action. In exchange for his help, Judas is offered [[thirty pieces of silver]]. Judas initially refuses, then accepts when Caiaphas suggests that he can use the money to help the poor (\"[[Damned for All Time/Blood Money]]\").\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT. PLEASE HELP TRIM IT INSTEAD TO MAKE IT MORE CONCISE.-->\n\n===Act II===\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT. PLEASE HELP TRIM IT INSTEAD TO MAKE IT MORE CONCISE.-->\nAt the [[Last Supper]], Jesus is stung when the others get drunk and pay little attention to him. He remarks that \"for all you care\" the wine they are drinking could be his blood and the bread his body. He asks them to remember him, then frustrated by their lack of understanding, he predicts that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] will [[Denial of Peter|deny him three times]] that night, and that another one of them will betray him. Judas admits that he is the one who will betray Jesus and, saying that he does not understand why Jesus did not plan things better, he leaves (\"The Last Supper\").\n\nThe remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (\"[[Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)]]\"). He tells God his doubts about whether his mission has had any success, and angrily demands to know why he should continue and suffer the horrible death that awaits him. Receiving no answer, he realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God.\n\nJudas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by [[Kiss of Judas|kissing him on the cheek]] (\"The Arrest\"). When Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|brought to trial before the Sanhedrin]], Caiaphas demands to know if he calls himself the Son of God, and Jesus responds merely \"That's what you say\". Caiaphas says that this is sufficient evidence and sends him to Pilate. Meanwhile, Peter is confronted by three people, to whom he denies that he knows Jesus (\"[[Peter's Denial (song)|Peter's Denial]]\"). Mary observes that Jesus had predicted this.\n\nPilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus again answers \"That's what you say\". Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]] (\"[[Pilate and Christ]]\"). The flamboyant King Herod asks Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles (\"[[King Herod's Song]]\"), but Jesus ignores him. Herod angrily sends him back to Pilate. Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace (\"[[Could We Start Again, Please?\"]]).\n\nJudas is horrified at Jesus's harsh treatment. He expresses regret to the Pharisees, fearing that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that he has done the right thing. Judas throws down the money he was given and storms out. He curses God for manipulating him, and commits suicide (\"Judas's Death\").\n\nAt Jesus's trial, Pilate attempts to interrogate Jesus, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus be [[crucifixion|crucified]].<ref>In the Broadway production, a stanza is added where Pilate admonishes the crowd for their sudden respect for Caesar, as well as for how they \"produce Messiahs by the sackful\"; this was kept for the film and subsequent productions.</ref> He tells the mob that Jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob he will have Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] (\"[[Trial Before Pilate]]\"). Pilate pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God. The crowd still calls for Jesus's death and finally Pilate reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus.\n\nAs Jesus awaits crucifixion, he is haunted by the ghost of Judas, who asks why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan (\"[[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Superstar]]\"). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words and dies (\"The Crucifixion\"). \n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THE PLOT.

It is used to treat [[community acquired pneumonia]] of mild to moderate severity. After significant safety concerns, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] sharply curtailed the approved uses of the drug in early 2007.\n\nTelithromycin is a semi-synthetic [[erythromycin]] derivative. It is created by substituting a ketogroup for the [[cladinose]] sugar and adding a [[carbamate]] ring in the [[lactone]] ring. An alkyl-aryl moiety is attached to this carbamate ring. Furthermore, the carbon at position 6 has been methylated, as is the case in [[clarithromycin]], to achieve better acid-stability.\n\n<!-- Society and culture -->\nIt was patented in 1994 and approved for medical use in 2001.<ref name=Fis2006>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=Jnos |last2=Ganellin |first2=C.

Headache and disturbances in taste also occur. Less common side-effects include palpitations, blurred vision, and rashes.

The study showed that a pyridine moiety that is part of the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the ciliary ganglion of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver.  Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin and the fluoroketolide, [[solithromycin]], do not contain the pyridine  moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bertrand | first1 = D | last2 = Bertrand | first2 = S | last3 = Neveu | first3 = E | last4 = Fernandes | first4 = P | year = 2010 | title = Molecular Characterization of Off-Target Activities of Telithromycin: a Potential Role for Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors | url = | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 54 | issue = 12| pages = 5399\u20135402 | doi=10.1128/aac.00840-10| pmid = 20855733 | pmc = 2981250 }}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nTelithromycin prevents [[Bacterium|bacteria]] from growing, by interfering with their [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]].

Telithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin. In addition, telithromycin strongly bind simultaneously to two domains of  23S RNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, where older macrolides bind strongly only to one domain and weakly to the second domain. Like many other protein synthesis inhibitors, telithromycin can also inhibit the formation of ribosomal subunits 50S and [[30S]].\n\n== Pharmacokinetics ==\nUnlike erythromycin, telithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally while being protected from gastric acids. It is fairly rapidly absorbed, and diffused into most tissues and [[phagocyte]]s. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, telithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of telithromycin is released. The concentration of telithromycin in the tissues is much higher than in plasma. Telithromycin fulfills a role that has arisen due to the rise of microbial resistance to existing macrolides and appears to be effective against macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The defining differentiating characteristic of the ketolides as opposed to other macrolides is the removal of the neutral sugar, L-cladinose from the 3 position of the macrolide ring and the subsequent oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl to a 3-keto functional group.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scheinfeld | first1 = N | year = 2004 | title = Telithromycin: A brief review of a new ketolide antibiotic | url = | journal = J Drug Dermat | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 409\u201313 | pmid = 15303785 }}</ref>\n\n== Metabolism ==\nTelithromycin is metabolized mainly in the liver, the main elimination route being the bile, a small portion is also excreted into the urine. About one third is excreted unchanged in bile and urine, the biliary route being favoured. Telithromycin's half-life is approximately ten hours.\n\n== History ==\n\nFrench [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]] (later [[Sanofi-Aventis]]) began phase II/III [[clinical trial]]s of telithromycin (HMR-3647) in 1998. Telithromycin was approved by the [[European Commission]] in July 2001 and subsequently went on sale in October 2001. In the US, telithromycin received U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval on April 1, 2004.\n\n===Safety controversies and fraud===\nFDA staffers publicly complained that safety problems and some data integrity issues were ignored prior to approval, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings to examine these complaints. One doctor went to prison because she falsified data in her portion of the clinical trials (about 400 patients out of 24,000). Further, Ketek seemed to cause liver problems, including \"liver failure\", to a greater extent than would be expected of a common-use antibiotic.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last= Splete\n|first= Heidi\n|author2=Kerri Wachter\n |date=March 2006\n|title= Liver toxicity reported with Ketek\n|journal= Internal Medicine News\n }}\n</ref> The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-oi_hrg.021307.FDA_drug_supply.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426053105/http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-oi_hrg.021307.FDA_drug_supply.shtml |archivedate=2007-04-26 }} House of Representatives, The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Honorable John D.

The doctor who treated the most patients in Study 3014 (about 400), Maria \"Anne\" Kirkman Campbell, served a 57-month sentence in federal prison after pleading guilty to mail fraud, by defrauding Aventis and others.

''The Times'' said that the FDA was embroiled in a \"fierce battle\" over the approval, fueled by exposure in the press.  Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman, Senate Finance Committee), Representatives Edward J. Markey (D-Mass) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif) held hearings.\n\n===FDA Warning===\nOn February 12, 2007, after an advisory committee discussion and vote in December 2006, the FDA announced a revision to the labeling of Ketek. The changes included the removal of two of the three previously approved indications: acute bacterial sinusitis and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The agency determined that the balance of benefits and risks no longer supported approval of the drug for these indications. Ketek remained on the market for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia of mild to moderate severity (acquired outside of hospitals or long-term care facilities). In addition, the FDA worked with the manufacturer to update the product labeling with a \"[[black box warning]],\" their strongest form of warning. Ketek's warning states that it should not be used in patients with [[myasthenia gravis]], a disease that causes muscle weakness.<ref>https://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01561.html</ref> Following this decision, Sanofi-Aventis withdrew the drug from active sales in the United States.\n\n== Available forms ==\nTelithromycin is administered as tablets.

It is used to treat [[community acquired pneumonia]] of mild to moderate severity. After significant safety concerns, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] sharply curtailed the approved uses of the drug in early 2007.\n\nTelithromycin is a semi-synthetic [[erythromycin]] derivative. It is created by substituting a ketogroup for the [[cladinose]] sugar and adding a [[carbamate]] ring in the [[lactone]] ring. An alkyl-aryl moiety is attached to this carbamate ring. Furthermore, the carbon at position 6 has been methylated, as is the case in [[clarithromycin]], to achieve better acid-stability.\n\n<!-- Society and culture -->\nIt was patented in 1994 and approved for medical use in 2001.<ref name=Fis2006>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=Jnos |last2=Ganellin |first2=C.

The study showed that a pyridine moiety that is part of the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the ciliary ganglion of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver.  Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin and the fluoroketolide, [[solithromycin]], do not contain the pyridine  moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bertrand | first1 = D | last2 = Bertrand | first2 = S | last3 = Neveu | first3 = E | last4 = Fernandes | first4 = P | year = 2010 | title = Molecular Characterization of Off-Target Activities of Telithromycin: a Potential Role for Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors | url = | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 54 | issue = 12| pages = 5399\u20135402 | doi=10.1128/aac.00840-10| pmid = 20855733 | pmc = 2981250 }}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\nTelithromycin prevents [[Bacterium|bacteria]] from growing, by interfering with their [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]].

Telithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin. In addition, telithromycin strongly bind simultaneously to two domains of  23S RNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, where older macrolides bind strongly only to one domain and weakly to the second domain. Like many other protein synthesis inhibitors, telithromycin can also inhibit the formation of ribosomal subunits 50S and [[30S]].\n\n== Pharmacokinetics ==\nUnlike erythromycin, telithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally while being protected from gastric acids. It is fairly rapidly absorbed, and diffused into most tissues and [[phagocyte]]s. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, telithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of telithromycin is released. The concentration of telithromycin in the tissues is much higher than in plasma. Telithromycin fulfills a role that has arisen due to the rise of microbial resistance to existing macrolides and appears to be effective against macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The defining differentiating characteristic of the ketolides as opposed to other macrolides is the removal of the neutral sugar, L-cladinose from the 3 position of the macrolide ring and the subsequent oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl to a 3-keto functional group.<ref>Scheinfeld N. Telithromycin: A brief review of a new ketolide antibiotic. J Drug Dermat 2004;3:409-13. {{PMID|15303785}}</ref>\n\n== Metabolism ==\nTelithromycin is metabolized mainly in the liver, the main elimination route being the bile, a small portion is also excreted into the urine. About one third is excreted unchanged in bile and urine, the biliary route being favoured. Telithromycin's half-life is approximately ten hours.\n\n== History ==\n\nFrench [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]] (later [[Sanofi-Aventis]]) began phase II/III [[clinical trial]]s of telithromycin (HMR-3647) in 1998. Telithromycin was approved by the [[European Commission]] in July 2001 and subsequently went on sale in October 2001. In the US, telithromycin received U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval on April 1, 2004.\n\n===Safety controversies and fraud===\nFDA staffers publicly complained that safety problems and some data integrity issues were ignored prior to approval, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings to examine these complaints. One doctor went to prison because she falsified data in her portion of the clinical trials (about 400 patients out of 24,000). Further, Ketek seemed to cause liver problems, including \"liver failure\", to a greater extent than would be expected of a common-use antibiotic.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last= Splete\n|first= Heidi\n|author2=Kerri Wachter\n |date=March 2006\n|title= Liver toxicity reported with Ketek\n|journal= Internal Medicine News\n }}\n</ref> The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-oi_hrg.021307.FDA_drug_supply.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426053105/http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-oi_hrg.021307.FDA_drug_supply.shtml |archivedate=2007-04-26 }} House of Representatives, The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Honorable John D.

If you have a question about a particular one, or want to know about additional sources, please help find some, and add them to this article, or put them on the talk page for this article. -->\nAn '''overworld''' is, in a broad sense, commonly  an area within a [[video game]] (though it can be in other things, too) that interconnects all its [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] or locations. They are mostly common in [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], though this does not exclude other [[video game genres]], such as some [[platformers]] and [[strategy game]]s.\n\nOverworlds generally feature a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] view or a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] of the [[Imaginary world|fictional world]] within the game. It often contains varied terrain (including caves, mountains, forests, and bodies of water) and a collection of towns and other locations (most commonly [[Dungeon crawl|dungeons]] or [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]). When the party enters one of these locations the world map display may remain on the screen, be replaced by the local geography, or be hidden until the party exits the location. In many games, the player is able to travel on the world map; in other games, the player uses the world map to select their next location. Typically, a dungeon houses a host of enemies, while a town usually is safe. In some games, there are a series of world maps.{{efn|In some ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, for example, the player can travel between the earth and the moon, each of which has its own world map. Additionally, in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', once the player obtains an airship, they may leave their current world to find themselves in a larger world map with a selection representing the first world.}} Some games allow the player to view only a portion of the world map at the beginning of the game, with new locations becoming visible as the game progresses, whereas other games show the entire world map from the beginning. The opposite term \"underworld\" refers to the world underneath the ground.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Role-playing video games===\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth httt world map.png|thumb|right|Overworld map from the video game ''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]''.]]\nThe [[Ultima (series)|Ultima series]] of [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] marks one of the first uses of an overworld. Many games have emulated ''Ultima''{{'}}s overworlds, especially fantasy-based ones. The most prominent example in this category is the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]]. In each of this type of overworld game, most of the action (or at least most of the plot-advancing action) takes place in towns, forests, dungeons, caves, castles (and the surrounding area), camps, fortresses, mass transportation systems, celestial bodies (e.g. the moon), and other locations. In the ''Dragon Quest'' series, the overworld is used as a \"travel map\", and changes to a closer perspective for direct gameplay or confrontation. The overworlds featured in most of the 2D adventures of this genre commonly depict the character(s)' proportions as larger than they actually would be in the world being travelled, thus lending necessary visibility to the player. The characters' animation in this type of overworld is often simpler than that found in the game's menus and other areas, while more complicated movement such as combat, climbing or visibly handling objects sometimes happens at closer perspectives, and often involves [[cutscene]]s.\n\n===''The Legend of Zelda'' series===\nWhile previous games have featured overworlds, one of the earliest console games to feature an overworld is the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. Gameplay in ''Zelda''{{'}}s overworld was virtually identical to that of its nine underground dungeon levels, offering a [[top-down perspective]] and including access to caves, bridges, mazes, shops and waterfalls as well as lurking dangers that range from enemies to tumbling rocks. Much of the immediate gameplay takes place in the overworld, and the diversity of terrain (as well as the sheer size of the overworld itself) ensures that the player will spend as much time exploring and searching above ground as they will below (or in any of the areas listed above). The concept of an overworld also offered a [[non-linear gameplay]] experience;<ref name=\"rpgamer review\">{{cite web | author=Long, Andrew | year= | title=Oldest School | publisher=RPGamer | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/zelda/z1/reviews/z1strev1.html | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> some believed this would cause the player to become confused and not know where to go, a sentiment which has endured as overworlds have become larger and more complex.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe ''Zelda'' series is well known for these large overworld areas, such as [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule Field|Hyrule Field]]. Many enemies inhabit the various overworlds. The player can see most of these without any special tools, and most are easily defeated or avoided. The game [[Minecraft]] is another popular example of a platform game with an Overworld.\n\nThere are special items available in most of the overworld areas in the series, but these are often non-essential to completing the overall objective; the main purpose served by an overworld is to connect more important places.\n\n===Platform games===\nAlthough large-scale overworlds were popularized by ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in 1986, the genre of [[platform game]]s did not have overworlds (in the main sense) until [[Platform game#Reshaping the genre|3D platformers]] appeared in the mid-1990s. The concept of an overworld in platform gaming prior to that time was limited to a \"level select\" style, which first was featured in the multi-genre [[Arcade game|arcade]] title ''[[Dragon Buster]]'',<ref>{{allgame|id=9953|Dragon Buster}}</ref> and popularized by other games such as ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.{{efn|In these and similar games, the character doesn't actually travel on a world map (viz. freedom to move is strictly limited to linear direction); rather, the player only repositions the character on an adjacent location (a dot or icon that represents a level) that is connected by a rail (which may not be visible) to other adjacent locations. The ''[[Wild Arms (series)|Wild Arms]]'' series and the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular examples.}}\nIn ''[[Spyro]]'' the first 3 games had a place called a \"home world\" that was like an over world. It contained portals to other levels of the game.\n\nPrevious titles like ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Castlevania#Film|Castlevania]]'' revolved around the player completing levels in a linear order, with no option to return to completed levels. It is likely that the overworlds developed for [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games, such as some of those listed above, evolved from the level-select type overworlds featured in prior 2D platform games, such as those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/product/specs/prtprdid,16515230/specs.html PC World \u2013 Super Mario Advance 4 (GBA) Test Report]</ref> Beginning with ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', every [[Super Mario|''Mario'' platformer]] has featured either a level-select type overworld (e.g. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'') or a hub-type overworld (e.g. Peach's Castle in ''[[Super Mario 64#Setting|Super Mario 64]]'' and the Comet Observatory in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'') \u2013 a central, usually enemy-free area \u2013 that connects to levels and other important places. As the genre evolved and became more popular, the overworld concept expanded into other platformers \u2013 from ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'' to the [[Donkey Kong (series)#Successors|''Donkey Kong'' series]] \u2013 becoming a staple of the genre that endures as a prominent feature.\n\n===''Minecraft''===\n[[Minecraft]] is an extremely popular platform and sandbox video game, available on nearly every platform, excluding [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. This game's overworld is a default, meaning the player is situated in the overworld by default,  unless the game is modified. Minecraft's overworld is one of the most popular overworld maps.\n\n===Home level===\n[[File:Angband.png|thumb|The town level in the roguelike game ''Angband''.]]\nA '''home level''' is an area found within a [[roguelike]] [[video game]]. It is usually a haven for the hero characters, where enemy hostility is minimal. In most cases, the home level features shops in which the player can purchase items, and is often the initial site of the story or game, although in some games it is a location discovered later. In some games, such as ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'', as the story progresses, the location of the home level may change, or there may be other such places that serve a similar purpose. ''[[Larn (video game)|Larn]]'', a 1980s roguelike game, was among the earliest to feature a home level.\n\nSome games feature a home level that contains many different points of interest. The home level in ''[[Angband (video game)|Angband]]'', for instance, consists of seven shops, the player's home (where characters may store unneeded items), and a staircase to the first dungeon [[Level (video games)|level]]. Some variants of the home level add specialty shops, quest locations, or a wilderness through which additional towns can be discovered.\n\n==Navigation==\nMany of the games that have an overworld feature a world map of some sort; these range from very basic \u2013 such as a gray rectangle with a dot indicating the position of the character in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' \u2013 to an overworld map that can be toggled on and off, but shows only rough outlines of various locations, as well as the character's ever-changing location, such as in later installments in the ''Zelda'' series, or many ''Final Fantasy'' games.\n\nOther games, including several installments in the ''Ultima'' and ''Wasteland'' series, include detailed, often colorful maps on cloth or paper that came bundled with the game and is meant to be used to navigate while playing the game. Games like ''Miracle Warriors'' even came with a little action figure in metal meant to be placed on your position.\n\nWhatever the map style employed (if any), varied world map terrain such as mountains, rivers and deserts may prevent the character(s) from visiting an area until they have completed a certain task or acquired a special skill, vehicle or other key item.{{efn|For example, in many [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''Zelda'']] games, [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must obtain an item hidden in one dungeon that will allow him to progress to the next dungeon. Often, these items can be obtained only after completing a side quest or reaching a certain point in the game.}} Many [[Role-playing video game|CRPGs]] eventually allow the player rapid movement around the overworld, using such methods as flying,{{efn|Many games, most notably those of the [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy'' series]], provide [[airship]]s for flying. Other games will feature flying animals such as large birds, [[Chocobo]]s or [[dragon]]s.}} sailing, or [[Teleportation|teleporting]] to various locations. The map icon is often represented as a rectangle. Usually, flying or sailing across one edge of the map will bring the character(s) to the edge of the opposite side.\n\nIn some games, certain areas of the overworld map are hidden from the player, or at least difficult to reach; these \"secret\" areas often contain difficult-to-obtain items, or they might simply hold [[Easter egg (virtual)|\"Easter Egg\"]]-style novelties or other such diversions. In some games, especially those that have a \"level select\" style of overworld (e.g. a lot of old-school [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[platform game]]s), portions of the overworld become available for play as certain tasks are completed (e.g. beating a particular level or discovering a secret hidden within a level).\n\n==Audio design==\nIn terms of [[video game music]], overworld themes are often orchestral in nature, and of greater length and complexity than other pieces in the same game, due to the amount of time spent traveling the overworld map.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Because players will usually visit a single level or area a few times in a given play session, the music for any such section of the game will typically be shorter and/or less complex,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89565567 \"The Evolution of Video Game Music\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', July 28, 2008.</ref> and thus less time-consuming for the designers to produce.

If you have a question about a particular one, or want to know about additional sources, please help find some, and add them to this article, or put them on the talk page for this article. -->\nAn '''overworld''' is, in a broad sense, commonly  an area within a [[video game]] (though it can be in other things, too) that interconnects all its [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] or locations. They are mostly common in [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], though this does not exclude other [[video game genres]], such as some [[platformers]] and [[strategy game]]s.\n\nOverworlds generally feature a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] view or a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] of the [[Imaginary world|fictional world]] within the game. It often contains varied terrain (including caves, mountains, forests, and bodies of water) and a collection of towns and other locations (most commonly [[Dungeon crawl|dungeons]] or [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]). When the party enters one of these locations the world map display may remain on the screen, be replaced by the local geography, or be hidden until the party exits the location. In many games, the player is able to travel on the world map; in other games, the player uses the world map to select their next location. Typically, a dungeon houses a host of enemies, while a town usually is safe. In some games, there are a series of world maps.{{efn|In some ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, for example, the player can travel between the earth and the moon, each of which has its own world map. Additionally, in ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', once the player obtains an airship, they may leave their current world to find themselves in a larger world map with a selection representing the first world.}} Some games allow the player to view only a portion of the world map at the beginning of the game, with new locations becoming visible as the game progresses, whereas other games show the entire world map from the beginning. The opposite term \"underworld\" refers to the world underneath the ground.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Role-playing video games===\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth httt world map.png|thumb|right|Overworld map from the video game ''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]''.]]\nThe [[Ultima (series)|Ultima series]] of [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] marks one of the first uses of an overworld. Many games have emulated ''Ultima''{{'}}s overworlds, especially fantasy-based ones. The most prominent example in this category is the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]]. In each of this type of overworld game, most of the action (or at least most of the plot-advancing action) takes place in towns, forests, dungeons, caves, castles (and the surrounding area), camps, fortresses, mass transportation systems, celestial bodies (e.g. the moon), and other locations. In the ''Dragon Quest'' series, the overworld is used as a \"travel map\", and changes to a closer perspective for direct gameplay or confrontation. The overworlds featured in most of the 2D adventures of this genre commonly depict the character(s)' proportions as larger than they actually would be in the world being travelled, thus lending necessary visibility to the player. The characters' animation in this type of overworld is often simpler than that found in the game's menus and other areas, while more complicated movement such as combat, climbing or visibly handling objects sometimes happens at closer perspectives, and often involves [[cutscene]]s.\n\n===''The Legend of Zelda'' series===\nWhile previous games have featured overworlds, one of the earliest console games to feature an overworld is the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. Gameplay in ''Zelda''{{'}}s overworld was virtually identical to that of its nine underground dungeon levels, offering a [[top-down perspective]] and including access to caves, bridges, mazes, shops and waterfalls as well as lurking dangers that range from enemies to tumbling rocks. Much of the immediate gameplay takes place in the overworld, and the diversity of terrain (as well as the sheer size of the overworld itself) ensures that the player will spend as much time exploring and searching above ground as they will below (or in any of the areas listed above). The concept of an overworld also offered a [[non-linear gameplay]] experience;<ref name=\"rpgamer review\">{{cite web | author=Long, Andrew | year= | title=Oldest School | publisher=RPGamer | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/zelda/z1/reviews/z1strev1.html | accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> some believed this would cause the player to become confused and not know where to go, a sentiment which has endured as overworlds have become larger and more complex.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe ''Zelda'' series is well known for these large overworld areas, such as [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule Field|Hyrule Field]]. Many enemies inhabit the various overworlds. The player can see most of these without any special tools, and most are easily defeated or avoided. The game [[Minecraft]] is another popular example of a platform game with an Overworld.\n\nThere are special items available in most of the overworld areas in the series, but these are often non-essential to completing the overall objective; the main purpose served by an overworld is to connect more important places.\n\n===Platform games===\nAlthough large-scale overworlds were popularized by ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in 1986, the genre of [[platform game]]s did not have overworlds (in the main sense) until [[Platform game#Reshaping the genre|3D platformers]] appeared in the mid-1990s. The concept of an overworld in platform gaming prior to that time was limited to a \"level select\" style, which first was first featured in the multi-genre [[Arcade game|arcade]] title ''[[Dragon Buster]]'',<ref>{{allgame|id=9953|Dragon Buster}}</ref> and popularized by other games such as ''[[Bionic Commando (Nintendo Entertainment System)|Bionic Commando]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''.{{efn|In these and similar games, the character doesn't actually travel on a world map (viz. freedom to move is strictly limited to linear direction); rather, the player only repositions the character on an adjacent location (a dot or icon that represents a level) that is connected by a rail (which may not be visible) to other adjacent locations. The ''[[Wild Arms (series)|Wild Arms]]'' series and the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular examples.}}\nIn ''[[Spyro]]'' the first 3 games had a place called a \"home world\" that was like an over world. It contained portals to other levels of the game.\n\nPrevious titles like ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Castlevania#Film|Castlevania]]'' revolved around the player completing levels in a linear order, with no option to return to completed levels. It is likely that the overworlds developed for [[3D computer graphics|3D]] games, such as some of those listed above, evolved from the level-select type overworlds featured in prior 2D platform games, such as those seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/product/specs/prtprdid,16515230/specs.html PC World \u2013 Super Mario Advance 4 (GBA) Test Report]</ref> Beginning with ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', every [[Super Mario|''Mario'' platformer]] has featured either a level-select type overworld (e.g. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'') or a hub-type overworld (e.g. Peach's Castle in ''[[Super Mario 64#Setting|Super Mario 64]]'' and the Comet Observatory in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'') \u2013 a central, usually enemy-free area \u2013 that connects to levels and other important places. As the genre evolved and became more popular, the overworld concept expanded into other platformers \u2013 from ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'' to the [[Donkey Kong (series)#Successors|''Donkey Kong'' series]] \u2013 becoming a staple of the genre that endures as a prominent feature.\n\n===''Minecraft''===\n[[Minecraft]] is an extremely popular platform and sandbox video game, available on nearly every platform, excluding [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 1]] and [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. This game's overworld is a default, meaning the player is situated in the overworld by default,  unless the game is modified. Minecraft's overworld is one of the most popular overworld maps.\n\n===Home level===\n[[File:Angband.png|thumb|The town level in the roguelike game ''Angband''.]]\nA '''home level''' is an area found within a [[roguelike]] [[video game]]. It is usually a haven for the hero characters, where enemy hostility is minimal. In most cases, the home level features shops in which the player can purchase items, and is often the initial site of the story or game, although in some games it is a location discovered later. In some games, such as ''[[Destiny of an Emperor]]'', as the story progresses, the location of the home level may change, or there may be other such places that serve a similar purpose. ''[[Larn (video game)|Larn]]'', a 1980s roguelike game, was among the earliest to feature a home level.\n\nSome games feature a home level that contains many different points of interest.

The church is dedicated to the [[Annunciation]], and was probably an early Christian [[basilica]], of which only the [[synthronon]] and the episcopal throne in the semi-circular sanctuary conch survive. In middle [[Byzantine]] times the building was converted into a transitional [[cross-in-square]] church. A domed [[narthex]] was later added, flanked by the chapel of [[Saint Akindynos]] to the north and a vaulted rectangular room to the south.\n\nAccording to an architrave inscription probably from the [[templon]], the church was renovated in 1052. The inscription also mentions the names of Bishop Leo, Niketas, \"''[[protospatharios]]'' and ''[[tourmarches]]'' of Naxia\" and Count Stephen Kamilaris. Other 16th and 17th-century inscriptions refer to subsequent repairs. The church interior is decorated in five successive layers dating to the [[Early Christian art and architecture|early Christian]] period; the 9th century (non-figurative decoration); and the 10th, 11th, and 13th centuries. Some of these were detached and then repositioned once the earliest layer had been removed, so [[Fresco|frescoes]] from different periods are now visible.\n\nThe first layer of frescoes dates to the 7th century - apostles adorn the bottom of the conch, while the side of the window has a depiction of St. Isidore. The second layer painted over the Apostles in the conch consisted of non-figurative decoration, with crosses in the arcades, and dates to the Iconoclast period in the 9th century. \n\nThe two superimposed layers uncovered in the [[dome]] have been dated to 1052 and 1056 respectively, as they have been linked to the architrave inscription and a further inscription in the north chapel, commemorating the Assumption of the Servant of God Anna in 1056. All the same, it is also believed that the first layer detached from the dome, along with other wall paintings in the south antenna, date to a slightly earlier period, in the 10th and 11th century. The depictions of Saints George, Nicholas, Dimitrios and Theodore incorporated in the eastern section of the second layer date to 1052.\n\nAccording to another view, the depiction of the Annunciation on the south wall of the sanctuary is later, dating to the 11th or 12th-13th century. In the late 13th century the lower part of the sanctuary conch was re-decorated with co-officiating bishops, only one of whom has survived in detached form.
