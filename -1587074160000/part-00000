Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1), the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s); and (2), the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present-day challenger tournaments. Sutter's book probably is the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]] are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the period of 1946 through April 27, 2003.\n*John Barrett, editor, ''World of Tennis Yearbooks'',

Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1), the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s); and (2), the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present-day challenger tournaments. Sutter's book probably is the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]] are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the period of 1946 through April 27, 2003.\n*John Barrett, editor, ''World of Tennis Yearbooks'',

Cody Sun and Rikara opted to leave the team at this point and they were replaced by players Huhi and Bang. Having many internal issues, Huhi moved to the 100 Thieves Academy roster, replacing Soligo, even though the team placed last in the spring regular season. Before the summer season started, Huhi left the team. A new addition, Amazing, joined the team to replace AnDa who reluctantly joins the Academy roster, while Ryu is moved to the Academy roster as the mid-laner. A month into the summer season, the team replaced Ssumday and Soligo with FakeGod and Ryu from the Academy roster. They ultimately finished the summer season in 8th place.\n\n====2020 Season====\nThe team started the season with PapaSmithy, joining the team as the new general manager. Zikz was the next addition to the roster, replacing Prolly as head coach. Meteos and Cody Sun rejoined the team for the second time, alongside additions Stunt and Ryoma. Ryu, Amazing, Bang and Aphromoo all left the team, with FakeGod rejoining Academy and Ssumday rejoining the main roster.\n\n===Counter-Strike: Global Offensive===\n====2017/2018 Season====\nIn December 2017, 100 Thieves announced that they signed the former roster of [[Immortals_(esports)|Immortals]]. The organization had issues with visas and a particular player, resulting in the team being disbanded.\n====2019/2020 Season====\nIn late October 2019, 100 Thieves announced the signing of the former [[Renegades (esports)|Renegades]] roster. At IEM Beijing 2019, the team placed second in the tournament, losing to [[Astralis]]. The team placed 7th-8th at the ESL Season 10 Pro League Finals, losing to [[Fnatic]].\n\n===Call of Duty===\nThe team started the season off signing the team of Kenny, Fero, Octane, Slasher, and Enable. They placed 9th-12th at CWL Las Vegas 2019, qualifying for the Pro League Qualifiers and the team qualified easily for the Pro League. After this, they had to re-evaluate the roster, and loan Priestahh and head coach Crowder from FaZe Clan, with Fero getting benched. At CWL Fort Worth 2019, the team was very close to winning the tournament, but because of a health issue involving Priestahh, he was sent to the hospital and replaced by Fero and the team ultimately finished 4th, losing to Team Reciprocity. At CWL London 2019, the team won the organization's first trophy. At CWL Anaheim 2019, the team won the organization's second trophy. After a long season of the Pro League, 100 Thieves finished second in Division B, qualifying for Pro League playoffs. At the Pro League Playoffs, the team placed 5th-6th, losing to [[Gen.G esports]]. In the 2019 Call of Duty World Championship, 100 Thieves finished second, with a very close loss to eUnited. 100 Thieves decided not to participate in the Call of Duty League and the players and coach left.\n\n==Cash App Compound==\nThe 100 Thieves [[Cash App]] Compound is a 15,000 square foot esports, entertainment, and apparel hub, located in [[Culver City, California]]. There are four different sports training rooms: first is the [[Rocket Mortgage]] League of Legends training room, second the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive training room, third is the [[Totino's]] Fortnite training room, lastly is the League of Legends Academy training room. They also have a content studio, which is worth around half a million dollars.<ref>https://twitter.com/TravisGafford/status/1220058648329646080</ref> Other areas include the Cash App Lounge, the [[Totino's]] basketball court, many business operation areas and four states of the art streaming pods.

Jones was replaced by [[Geddy Lee]] a month later, and Rutsey was replaced by [[Neil Peart]] in 1974, making Lifeson the only constant member. \n\nWith Rush, Lifeson plays electric and acoustic guitars, as well as other [[string instrument]]s such as [[mandola]], [[mandolin]], and [[bouzouki]]. He also performs backing vocals in live performances, and occasionally plays keyboards and bass pedal synthesizers. Like the other members of Rush, Lifeson performs real-time on-stage triggering of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampled]] instruments, concurrently with his guitar playing.<ref name=\"onstagemag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |title=Onstagemag.com |publisher=Onstagemag.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archivedate=18 October 2002  }}</ref>\n\nThe bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although Lifeson has contributed to a body of work outside the band as well.

Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.\n\nLifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:\n\n{{quote|My brother-in-law played flamenco guitar.

''Vapor Trails'' is the first Rush album since the 1970s to lack keyboards\u2014as such, Lifeson used over 50 different guitars in what [[Shawn Hammond]] of ''Guitar Player'' called \"his most rabid and experimental playing ever.\" Geddy Lee was amenable to leaving keyboards off the album due in part to Lifeson's ongoing concern about their use. Lifeson's approach to the guitar tracks for the album eschewed traditional riffs and solos in favour of \"tonality and harmonic quality.\"<ref name=Hammond/>\n\nDuring live performances, he used foot pedals to cue various synthesizer, guitar, and backing vocal effects as he played.\n\n===''Victor''===\nWhile the bulk of&nbsp;Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, his first major outside work was his solo project, ''[[Victor (album)|Victor]]'', released in 1996. ''Victor'' was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. ''Victor'' is attributed as the ''artist'' as well as the ''album title''). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the [[W.&nbsp;H. Auden]] poem, also entitled \"Victor\". Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album. A follow-up album, possibly including vocals by [[Sarah McLachlan]], was rumoured in the late 1990s, but was apparently shelved due to Atlantic Records' lack of support for the first album.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eric Hansen |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |title=Alex Lifeson's \"Victor\" linernotes and lyrics from Power Windows |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702083720/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Side projects===\n{{main article|List of songs recorded by Rush#Alex Lifeson}}\nLifeson has also contributed to a body of work outside his involvement with the band in the form of instrumental contributions to other musical outfits.

(Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound \"events\" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<ref name=\"onstagemag.com\" />\n\n==Influence==\nSome artists have cited Lifeson as an influence, including [[Paul Gilbert]] of [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 28 February 2017 | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/paulgilbert-May2004.htm | title = Interview With Paul Gilbert | first = Keith | last = McDonald | quote = ''Q'': Who were your guitar influences?<br />''Paul Gilbert'': Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson [...] | date = May 2004 | website = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 4 April 2017 | quote = [...] When they played the song \u2018La Villa Strangiato,\u2019 the solo that Alex [Lifeson] played really had a huge influence on me.

This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the [[W.&nbsp;H. Auden]] poem, also entitled \"Victor\". Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album.

(Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound \"events\" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).<ref name=\"onstagemag.com\" />\n\n==Influence==\nSome artists have cited Lifeson as an influence, including [[Paul Gilbert]] of [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 28 February 2017 | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/paulgilbert-May2004.htm | title = Interview With Paul Gilbert | first = Keith | last = McDonald | quote = ''Q'': Who were your guitar influences?<br />''Paul Gilbert'': Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Lifeson [...] | date = May 2004 | website = [[Metal Rules]]}}</ref> [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]],<ref>{{ cite web | accessdate = 4 April 2017 | quote = [...] When they played the song \u2018La Villa Strangiato,\u2019 the solo that Alex [Lifeson] played really had a huge influence on me.

His artworks often derive from in-depth research into narratives from the fields of architecture, design and popular culture and are characterized by his usage of diverse media, including installation, photography, video, writing, sculpture, and drawing. Beck also works collaboratively and has, since the late 1990s, co-authored various exhibitions, publications, and exhibit design projects with artist [[Julie Ault]].\n\n== Education and teaching ==\nMartin Beck studied at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna|University of Applied Arts]] as well as at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]], both in Vienna, Austria, where he graduated in 1988. Beck has been a visiting artist in the art and design programs at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], Valencia, California (1999\u20132000); he has held a guest professorship in the CCCS program at the [[\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieur des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]], Geneva (2001\u20132005).

He adapts many mediums and strategies in order to \u201c...problematize the exhibition form, along with the social and aesthetic implications it wields on our perceptions.\u201d<ref>James Voorhies, \u201cInstitution Building,\u201d in Martin Beck: An Organized System of Instructions. Sternberg Press. 2017.</ref> His exhibitions investigate the boundaries between artworks, exhibit and support structure, as well as the relationship between art and social conditions or popular culture. Artist and critic Yuki Higashino writes in the Avery Review: \u201c[Beck\u2019s] true medium is exhibition making. It is the totality, the configuration of artifacts, the social context, the supplementary materials like a press release, and the architecture of the venue that together constitute the art exhibition and the work of art that Beck produces.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://averyreview.com/issues/26/the-how-of-an-exhibition|title=The How of an Exhibition|first=Yuki|last=Higashino|date=October 2017|publisher=The Avery Review}}</ref> Frequently Beck\u2019s projects and shows include artifacts or works by other artists, architects, designers, and historical objects. His practice elaborates and expands the conceptual tradition of redefining the role of the artist and of what constitutes an artistic practice.\n\n== Bodies of work ==\nHis main bodies of works from the 2000s investigated how the modern conception of display developed in the mid-20th century. For his solo exhibition ''an Exhibit viewed played populated'' at Grazer Kunstverein, Beck presented works that emerged out of his research on [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]\u2019s 1957 ''an Exhibit'' in which colored acrylic panels, suspended from the gallery ceiling, created an environment that turned the gallery space itself into an artwork. For ''Installation'', his collaborative exhibition with Julie Ault at Secession in Vienna, he reconstructed a modular exhibit system called Struc-Tube, designed by [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]] in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.secession.at/en/exhibition/ault-beck-2/|title=Julie Ault / Martin Beck \u00ab secession|website=www.secession.at|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> The system was presented both as a sculpture and a functional structure to display other works by Beck and Ault.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secession.at/en/exhibition/ault-beck-2/|title=Installation|date=2006|publisher=seccession}}</ref> Subsequently, he used the same tubular system as a protagonist for a video-work titled ''About the Relative Size of Things in the Universe'' (2007), first presented as part of his exhibition ''The details are not the details'' at the artist-run gallery [[Orchard (artist-run space)|Orchard]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/reviews/200707/martin-beck-42145|title=Martin Beck|last=Burton|first=Johanna|date=September 2007|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Beck frequently designed exhibitions for art institutions, mostly in collaboration with Ault. These include over two dozen shows for the [[International Center of Photography]] in New York between 2001 and 2004; ''X-Screen: Film Installations and Actions of the 1960s and 1970s'' (2003) and ''Changing Channels: Art and Television 1963\u20131987'' (2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mumok.at/en/events/changing-channels|title=Changing Channels|date=2010|publisher=mumok}}</ref> for [[Mumok]] \u2013 Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna; ''Projekt Migration'' (2005) at K\u00f6lnischer Kunstverein, Cologne; ''Journeys: How Travelling Fruit, Ideas and Buildings Rearrange Our Environment'' (2010) at [[Canadian Centre for Architecture|Canadian Center for Architecture]], Montreal, and ''Jim Hodges: Give More Than You Take'' (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcritical.com/2014/10/31/maddie-phinney-on-jim-hodges/|title=Give You So Much More: Jim Hodges at the Hammer Museum|first=Maddie|last=Phinney|date=October 2014|publisher=artcritical}}</ref> at the [[Hammer Museum]], Los Angeles. In 2011, in collaboration with architect Ken Saylor, Beck designed the gallery architecture of Ludlow 38 in New York.\n\nIn more recent years, Beck\u2019s practice has expanded to address the cross-section of design, social history, and pop culture. For his project ''Panel 2\u2014\u201cNothing better than a touch of ecology and catastrophe to unite the social classes...'',\" he drew on the events of the 1970 [[International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA)|International Design Conference in Aspen]] (IDCA) and the development of the [[Aspen Movie Map]]. The 1970 conference, themed \u201cEnvironment by Design,\u201d marked a turning point in design history wherein the vanguard of 1950s modernism such as George Nelson and [[Herbert Bayer]] confronted younger, hippie culture-influenced environmental activists and designers. Beck combined the narrative of this event with his research on the predecessor of today\u2019s navigation systems and developed an exhibition consisting of videos, photography, prints, sculpture, and artifacts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/201307/jeannine-tang-on-martin-beck-s-the-environmental-witch-hunt-2008-42644|title=Unsustainable Design: Jeannine Tang on Martin Beck\u2019s The Environmental Witch-Hunt, 2008|last=Tang|first=Jeannine|date=September 2013|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afterall.org/online/contentious-utopias-martin-beck-s-avant-garde-art-and-design#|title=Contentious Utopias: Martin Beck\u2019s Avant-Garde Art and Design|first=David Everitt|last=Howe|date=January 2012|publisher=Afterall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/martin-beck|title=Martin Beck|first=Ian|last=Hunt|date=November 2008|publisher=Frieze}}</ref>\n\nBeck\u2019s interests have progressed to the formation and functioning of temporary communities. Through a series of loosely connected works, he has been exploring the history of American countercultural communes of the 1960s and early 1970s. His video ''Turn Take Merge'' uses GPS directions leading from Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, the epicenter of 1960s hippie culture, to [[Drop City]], a countercultural community established in southern Colorado in 1965 and abandoned by the early 1970s that became known as the first rural hippie commune. For the work titled ''rumors and murmurs'' (2012/17), Beck used an illustration from the 1968 ''Dome Cookbook'' by [[Steve Baer]], a manual for dome building, to create a freestanding wall covered in fabric sewn together from irregular polygons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/martin-beck-47-canal/|title=Long Way Home: Martin Beck at 47 Canal|first=Aimee|last=Walleston|date=November 2012|publisher=Art in America}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, Beck worked on ''Last Night'', a series of works centered around a sequence of records [[David Mancuso]] played on June 2, 1984 during one of the last dance parties of the Prince Street iteration of [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], an underground dance party begun by Mancuso in 1970. Beck researched all the records played that night and published their production information as an artist book in 2013 (a revised second edition was published in 2019). The culmination of his project was a thirteen-and-half hour video work, first presented as an installation at [[The Kitchen]] in New York (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filthydreams.org/2017/03/26/lost-in-music-reclaiming-past-disco-days-at-martin-becks-last-night/|title=Lost In Music: Reclaiming Past Disco Days At Martin Beck\u2019s \u2018Last Night\u2019|first=Emily|last=Colucci|date=March 2017|publisher=filthy dreams}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thekitchen.org/event/martin-beck-last-night|title=Martin Beck: Last Night|date=March 2017|publisher=The Kitchen}}</ref> The video shows each record played in its entirety on a vintage turntable.\n\nBoth projects explore the notion of community, however temporal, and the social and physical structures that are required for its formation. Art historian Branden W. Joseph wrote: \u201cThe question \u2018Is there a form to shared togetherness?\u2019 guided Beck\u2019s investigation into both the communes of the 1960s... and the disco of the \u201970s and early \u201980s, two cultural poles most often perceived as in stark opposition to each other. (This dichotomy is similar to that between the counterculture of the \u201960s and the management culture of the following decades, which Beck\u2019s work also deconstructs.)\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/201710/branden-w-joseph-72458|title=Best of 2017: Martin Beck|last1=Joseph|first1=Brandon|date=|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Beck was commissioned to develop a project to go along with the re-branding, initiated by then-director James Voorhies, of the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] at Harvard University.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://carpenter.center/program/martin-beck-program|title=Martin Beck: Program|date= October 2016|publisher=Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts}}</ref> The commission resulted in a two-year exhibition titled ''Program'' that consisted of ten episodic interventions, each addressing one of the institution\u2019s channels of communication.

His artworks often derive from in-depth research into narratives from the fields of architecture, design and popular culture and are characterized by his usage of diverse media, including installation, photography, video, writing, sculpture, and drawing. Beck also works collaboratively and has, since the late 1990s, co-authored various exhibitions, publications, and exhibit design projects with artist [[Julie Ault]].\n\n== Education and teaching ==\nMartin Beck studied at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna|University of Applied Arts]] as well as at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]], both in Vienna, Austria, where he graduated in 1988. Beck has been a visiting artist in the art and design programs at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], Valencia, California (1999\u20132000); he has held a guest professorship in the CCCS program at the [[\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieur des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]], Geneva (2001\u20132005). Since 2004, he has worked as a professor at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/1811196/Nachbesetzungen-an-der-Akademie|title=Nachbesetzungen an der Akademie|last=|first=|date=October 2004|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> where he teaches courses on exhibition and display issues as well as artistic and design methodology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.akbild.ac.at/portal_akbild_cardbox/9D50A9EBAD167F75/?searchterm=martin+beck&set_language=de|title=Beck, Univ.-Prof. Mag.

He adapts many mediums and strategies in order to \u201c...problematize the exhibition form, along with the social and aesthetic implications it wields on our perceptions.\u201d<ref>James Voorhies, \u201cInstitution Building,\u201d in Martin Beck: An Organized System of Instructions. Sternberg Press. 2017.</ref> His exhibitions investigate the boundaries between artworks, exhibit and support structure, as well as the relationship between art and social conditions or popular culture. Artist and critic Yuki Higashino writes in the Avery Review: \u201c[Beck\u2019s] true medium is exhibition making. It is the totality, the configuration of artifacts, the social context, the supplementary materials like a press release, and the architecture of the venue that together constitute the art exhibition and the work of art that Beck produces.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://averyreview.com/issues/26/the-how-of-an-exhibition|title=The How of an Exhibition|first=Yuki|last=Higashino|date=October 2017|publisher=The Avery Review}}</ref> Frequently Beck\u2019s projects and shows include artifacts or works by other artists, architects, designers, and historical objects. His practice elaborates and expands the conceptual tradition of redefining the role of the artist and of what constitutes an artistic practice.\n\n== Bodies of work ==\nHis main bodies of works from the 2000s investigated how the modern conception of display developed in the mid-20th century. For his solo exhibition ''an Exhibit viewed played populated'' at Grazer Kunstverein, Beck presented works that emerged out of his research on [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]\u2019s 1957 ''an Exhibit'' in which colored acrylic panels, suspended from the gallery ceiling, created an environment that turned the gallery space itself into an artwork. For ''Installation'', his collaborative exhibition with Julie Ault at Secession in Vienna, he reconstructed a modular exhibit system called Struc-Tube, designed by [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]] in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.secession.at/en/exhibition/ault-beck-2/|title=Julie Ault / Martin Beck \u00ab secession|website=www.secession.at|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> The system was presented both as a sculpture and a functional structure to display other works by Beck and Ault.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secession.at/en/exhibition/ault-beck-2/|title=Installation|date=2006|publisher=seccession}}</ref> Subsequently, he used the same tubular system as a protagonist for a video-work titled ''About the Relative Size of Things in the Universe'' (2007), first presented as part of his exhibition ''The details are not the details'' at the artist-run gallery [[Orchard (artist-run space)|Orchard]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/reviews/200707/martin-beck-42145|title=Martin Beck|last=Burton|first=Johanna|date=September 2007|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Beck frequently designed exhibitions for art institutions, mostly in collaboration with Ault. These include over two dozen shows for the [[International Center of Photography]] in New York between 2001 and 2004; ''X-Screen: Film Installations and Actions of the 1960s and 1970s'' (2003) and ''Changing Channels: Art and Television 1963\u20131987'' (2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mumok.at/en/events/changing-channels|title=Changing Channels|date=2010|publisher=mumok}}</ref> for [[Mumok]] \u2013 Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna; ''Projekt Migration'' (2005) at K\u00f6lnischer Kunstverein, Cologne; ''Journeys: How Travelling Fruit, Ideas and Buildings Rearrange Our Environment'' (2010) at [[Canadian Centre for Architecture|Canadian Center for Architecture]], Montreal, and ''Jim Hodges: Give More Than You Take'' (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcritical.com/2014/10/31/maddie-phinney-on-jim-hodges/|title=Give You So Much More: Jim Hodges at the Hammer Museum|first=Maddie|last=Phinney|date=October 2014|publisher=artcritical}}</ref> at the [[Hammer Museum]], Los Angeles. In 2011, in collaboration with architect Ken Saylor, Beck designed the gallery architecture of Ludlow 38 in New York.\n\nIn more recent years, Beck\u2019s practice has expanded to address the cross-section of design, social history, and pop culture. For his project ''Panel 2\u2014\u201cNothing better than a touch of ecology and catastrophe to unite the social classes...'',\" he drew on the events of the 1970 [[International Design Conference in Aspen (IDCA)|International Design Conference in Aspen]] (IDCA) and the development of the [[Aspen Movie Map]]. The 1970 conference, themed \u201cEnvironment by Design,\u201d marked a turning point in design history wherein the vanguard of 1950s modernism such as George Nelson and [[Herbert Bayer]] confronted younger, hippie culture-influenced environmental activists and designers. Beck combined the narrative of this event with his research on the predecessor of today\u2019s navigation systems and developed an exhibition consisting of videos, photography, prints, sculpture, and artifacts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/201307/jeannine-tang-on-martin-beck-s-the-environmental-witch-hunt-2008-42644|title=Unsustainable Design: Jeannine Tang on Martin Beck\u2019s The Environmental Witch-Hunt, 2008|last=Tang|first=Jeannine|date=September 2013|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afterall.org/online/contentious-utopias-martin-beck-s-avant-garde-art-and-design#|title=Contentious Utopias: Martin Beck\u2019s Avant-Garde Art and Design|first=David Everitt|last=Howe|date=January 2012|publisher=Afterall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/martin-beck|title=Martin Beck|first=Ian|last=Hunt|date=November 2008|publisher=Frieze}}</ref>\n\nBeck\u2019s interests have progressed to the formation and functioning of temporary communities. Through a series of loosely connected works, he has been exploring the history of American countercultural communes of the 1960s and early 1970s. His video ''Turn Take Merge'' uses GPS directions leading from Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, the epicenter of 1960s hippie culture, to [[Drop City]], a countercultural community established in southern Colorado in 1965 and abandoned by the early 1970s that became known as the first rural hippie commune. For the work titled ''rumors and murmurs'' (2012/17), Beck used an illustration from the 1968 ''Dome Cookbook'' by [[Steve Baer]], a manual for dome building, to create a freestanding wall covered in fabric sewn together from irregular polygons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/martin-beck-47-canal/|title=Long Way Home: Martin Beck at 47 Canal|first=Aimee|last=Walleston|date=November 2012|publisher=Art in America}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, Beck worked on ''Last Night'', a series of works centered around a sequence of records [[David Mancuso]] played on June 2, 1984 during one of the last dance parties of the Prince Street iteration of [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], an underground dance party begun by Mancuso in 1970. Beck researched all the records played that night and published their production information as an artist book in 2013 (a revised second edition was published in 2019). The culmination of his project was a thirteen-and-half hour video work, first presented as an installation at [[The Kitchen]] in New York (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filthydreams.org/2017/03/26/lost-in-music-reclaiming-past-disco-days-at-martin-becks-last-night/|title=Lost In Music: Reclaiming Past Disco Days At Martin Beck\u2019s \u2018Last Night\u2019|first=Emily|last=Colucci|date=March 2017|publisher=filthy dreams}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thekitchen.org/event/martin-beck-last-night|title=Martin Beck: Last Night|date=March 2017|publisher=The Kitchen}}</ref> The video shows each record played in its entirety on a vintage turntable.\n\nBoth projects explore the notion of community, however temporal, and the social and physical structures that are required for its formation. Art historian Branden W. Joseph wrote: \u201cThe question \u2018Is there a form to shared togetherness?\u2019 guided Beck\u2019s investigation into both the communes of the 1960s... and the disco of the \u201970s and early \u201980s, two cultural poles most often perceived as in stark opposition to each other. (This dichotomy is similar to that between the counterculture of the \u201960s and the management culture of the following decades, which Beck\u2019s work also deconstructs.)\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/201710/branden-w-joseph-72458|title=Best of 2017: Martin Beck|last1=Joseph|first1=Brandon|date=|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Beck was commissioned to develop a project to go along with the re-branding, initiated by then-director James Voorhies, of the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] at Harvard University.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://carpenter.center/program/martin-beck-program|title=Martin Beck: Program|date= October 2016|publisher=Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts}}</ref> The commission resulted in a two-year exhibition titled ''Program'' that consisted of ten episodic interventions, each addressing one of the institution\u2019s channels of communication.

The painting contains vivid suggestions of martyrdom, and broke a standard rule of historical portraiture by featuring individuals who had not been present at the scene, dressed in modern instead of classical costumes. The painting has become one of the best-known images in English art.\n\n== Historical context ==\n''The Death of General Wolfe'' depicts the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle of Quebec]], also known as the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], on September 13, 1759. This was a pivotal event in the [[Seven Years' War]] and decided the fate of [[New France|France's colonies in North America]].\n\nThe [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|battle]] was fought between the British Army and the French Army; the pitched fighting lasted only fifteen minutes.  The British Army was commanded by [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]]. Although successful in holding the British line against the French and winning the battle, General Wolfe was mortally wounded by several gunshots.\n\nIn death, General Wolfe gained fame as a [[Britishness|national hero]].

Wolfe went into battle armed as his men were, although his musket was of higher quality. His dress is also of note. He is wearing a red coat, a red waistcoat, red breeches, and a white shirt. Such dress was rather simple, especially for a commanding officer.\n\nNext to Wolfe, in the blue jacket, is Dr [[Thomas Hinde]], who is attempting to stem the bleeding from Wolfe's wounds. The general later died in the doctor's hands.\n\nIn the background, and to the left of the men surrounding Wolfe, an approaching runner is depicted. He is waving his hat in one hand to attract their attention, and with the other hand carries a captured flag with the [[Fleur-de-lis]] (a symbol of France)\u2014symbolic of the news relayed to the dying Wolfe that the French were being defeated.\n\nThe inclusion of [[General Simon Fraser of Lovat|Simon Fraser]], Lieutenant Colonel of the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]] (behind the man in green uniform, identified in the painting as [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]]) is interesting, as General Wolfe reportedly spoke highly of Fraser's regiment, yet Fraser was not at the battle, as he was recovering from wounds received earlier.  In the painting, Fraser wears the Fraser tartan, which was probably worn by officers in that regiment. All in all only four of the fourteen men depicted were actually at the battleground.\n\nWest's choice to depict his subjects in contemporary clothing was highly controversial at the time. Although the depicted events had taken place only eleven years prior, the prevailing convention of West's time would have been to convey such subject matter in a [[history painting]]; an artistic tradition in which the portrayal of contemporary dress was considered unsuitable. During the painting process, Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] instructed West to clothe the subjects in classical attire, to which West declined. After completion of the painting, [[George III]] refused to purchase it, believing that West's choice of clothing compromised the dignity of the image. However, subsequent years brought a shift in opinion and artistic convention, and the painting was largely redeemed, overcoming earlier objections and inaugurating a practice of greater contemporary accuracy in history painting.<ref name=smart/>\n[[File:DeathofWolfe.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[William Woollett]]'s engraving was the best-known copy of West's original and became popular around the world <ref>[http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html New Brunswick Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619055946/http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html |date=2009-06-19 }}</ref>]]\n\nThe painting was originally exhibited at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in [[London|London, England]].

The painting has become one of the best-known images in English art.\n\n== Historical context ==\n''The Death of General Wolfe'' depicts the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle of Quebec]], also known as the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], on September 13, 1759. This was a pivotal event in the [[Seven Years' War]] and decided the fate of [[New France|France's colonies in North America]].\n\nThe [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|battle]] was fought between the British Army and the French Army; the pitched fighting lasted only fifteen minutes.  The British Army was commanded by [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]]. Although successful in holding the British line against the French and winning the battle, General Wolfe was mortally wounded by several gunshots.\n\nIn death, General Wolfe gained fame as a [[Britishness|national hero]].  He became an icon of the [[Seven Years' War]] and of British dominance in late eighteenth century [[British North America|North America]].<ref name=\"tfaoi.com\">http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa128.htm</ref>\n\n== Details ==\nWest depicts General Wolfe as a [[Christ]]-like figure.

{"title_page": "History of Ireland (800\u20131169)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{History of Ireland}}\nThe '''history of Ireland 800\u20131169''' covers the period in the [[history of Ireland]] from the first [[Viking]] raids to the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]]. The first two centuries of this period are characterised by Viking raids and the subsequent [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements along the coast. Viking ports were established at [[Dublin]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Limerick]], which became the first large towns in [[Ireland]].\n\nIreland consisted of many semi-independent [[t\u00faatha]], and during the entire period, attempts were made by various factions to gain political control over the whole of the island. For the first two centuries of this period, this was mainly a rivalry between putative [[High Kings of Ireland]] from the northern and southern branches of the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. The one who came closest to being de facto king over the whole of Ireland, however, was [[Brian Boru]], the first high king in this period not belonging to the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.\n\nFollowing Brian's death at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, the political situation became more complex with rivalry for high kingship from several clans and dynasties. Brian's descendants failed to maintain a unified throne, and regional squabbling over territory led indirectly to the invasion of the [[Normans]] under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]] in [[1169 in Ireland|1169]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Eoin MacNeill.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Eoin MacNeill]], one of the pioneers in modern studies of Irish medieval history]]\nDue to the rich amount of written sources, the study of Irish history 800\u20131169 has, to a large extent, focused on gathering, interpretation and [[textual criticism]] of these. Only recently have other sources of historical knowledge received more attention, particularly [[archaeology]]. Since the modern excavations of [[Dublin]] started in 1961, followed by similar efforts in [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]] and [[Limerick]], great advances have been made in the understanding of the physical character of the towns established during this period.<ref>[[#WallaceRIA|Wallace, The archaeology...]], pp. 814\u201315.</ref>\n\nThe first part of the period from 800 to 1014 is well-studied; the \"Viking age\" has attracted the interest of historians for quite some time. The period between 1014 and 1169 has received less attention. In the words of Sean Duffy, this period\n<blockquote>has \u2013 historiographically speaking \u2013 fallen between two stools. Historians of early medieval Ireland, seeking to conclude their narratives on a high note, have traditionally done so after recounting the death of the famous high-king Brian B\u00f3rama (Boru) at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. On the other hand, historians of later medieval Ireland generally choose to begin proceedings with the English invasion of the 1160s. Eleventh- and early twelfth-century Ireland has, therefore, often assumed the character of a snappy epilogue or a lengthy prologue.<ref>[[#Duffy09|Duffy, Ireland, c. 1000 \u2013 c. 1100]], p. 285.</ref><ref group=\"note\">See also [[#McNeill|McNeill, \"Archaeology\"]], \"The 150 years before 1200 have been lost, between the assumptions that life was a continuation of the fifth through eighth-century world and that the incursion of English lords marked a fundamental change throughout Ireland.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn trying to interpret the history of early Ireland, one of the most frequently asked questions addressed by historians is how early it is possible to speak of an Irish nation encompassing the whole island of Ireland. Early poet-historians like [[Flann Mainistrech]] constructed a history of a monarchy of all Ireland going back to and beyond St Patrick. Only a hundred years after Mainistrech, [[Gerald of Wales]] described the Irish society in his [[Topographia Hibernica]] as utterly primitive and savage. At the beginning of modern scholarly interpretation of Irish history, [[Eoin MacNeill]] and [[G.H. Orpen]] came to opposite conclusions analyzing the same period. Orpen saw an anarchic country still in 'a tribal state'; he could see no ''natio'', no wider community in Ireland than the tribe. MacNeill stressed the reality of the high-kingship of Ireland and the existence of many of those institutions of government which Orpen found wanting, and claimed that Irish law had a national character.<ref>[[#OCorNation|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Nationality and Kingship...\"]]</ref>\n\n==Nature of the written sources==\n[[File:Book of Leinster, folio 53.jpg|thumb|right|Folio 53 from the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'']]\n\nA large body of contemporary and near-contemporary material on early medieval Ireland has survived. From the titles of works mentioned in these sources, it is clear that a great deal of additional material has now been lost. The surviving materials usually exist in the form of much later copies, and it is only from comparison of the various texts that the original documents can be reconstructed.<ref>[[#Hughes72|Hughes, ''Early Christian Ireland'']], is a general survey of the subject.</ref>\n\nExtant [[Irish annals]] are ultimately derived from the now-lost [[Chronicle of Ireland]] which was probably being compiled in the midlands of Ireland by around 800. All include material derived from other sources, or added at a later date. The ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'' cover most of this period, but have a gap between 1132 and 1155. The ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'' survive only in an eccentric 17th-century English translation, and the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' for this period are lost with [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]]'s abbreviated copy known as the ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' supplying only part of the missing material. The ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' are late, and include some material of doubtful origin. While the annals provide a considerable amount of information, they are generally terse, and most focus their attention on the doings of the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] and of churchmen.<ref>[[#Hughes72|Hughes, ''Early Christian Ireland'']], chapter 4, especially pp. 135\u201337.; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. xix.; [[#OCroRIAvii|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, \"Ireland 400\u2013800\"]], ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the annals, a large number of genealogies survive, along with geographical and legal texts, poetry, sagas and hagiography.\n\nIn the 12th century, propaganda text like [[Caithr\u00e9im Chellach\u00e1in Chaisil]] and [[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]] were composed.

People lived in rural communities, and the only larger settlements were monastic towns of varying sizes. The monasteries played an important part in society, not just with regards to religious and cultural life, but also to economy and politics. [[Christianization]] had begun in the 5th century, and by the early 9th century the island was almost entirely Christian. However, the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]'' (written sometime in the 8th or 9th century) hints that [[Celtic paganism|paganism]] had not yet been fully uprooted.\n\n[[File:Ireland early peoples and politics.gif|thumb|300px|Peoples and subdivisions of early Ireland]]\n[[Eoin MacNeill]] identified the \"oldest certain fact in the political history of Ireland\" as the existence in late prehistory of a pentarchy, probably consisting of the ''c\u00f3iceda'' or \"fifths\" of the [[Ulaid]] (Ulster), the [[Connachta]] (Connacht), the [[Laigin]] (Leinster), Mumu ([[Munster]]) and [[Kingdom of Mide|Mide]] (Meath), although some accounts discount Mide and split Mumu in two.<ref>Eoin MacNeill, ''Phases of Irish History'', Dublin, 1920, pp. 98\u2013132.</ref> This is not an accurate description of the political landscape c. 800,<ref>[[#OCroRIAvii|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, D\u00e1ibhi (2005) Ireland, 400\u2013800]] pp. 187\u201388.</ref><ref group=\"note\">\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn also points out the irony of \"at no time in the historical period did the political division represented by the word ''c\u00f3iced''... ...have a tangible existence\"</ref> but when discussing the political subdivisions of Ireland at this time, it is still useful to refer to this system; if Laigin and Mide are combined as Leinster, it roughly corresponds with the modern [[Provinces of Ireland|four provinces of Ireland]].\n\nThe [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], divided in two main branches known as \"Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\" and \"Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\", was the leading dynasty in Ireland.<ref name=\"OCorV&I_p2\">[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings & Ireland\"]], p. 2.</ref><ref group=\"note\">They may not have been as dominant in earlier history as medieval sources tend to claim, according to [[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings & Ireland\"]] they :\"paraded illustrious ancestors and their claim to precedence was expressed in an elaborate mythography that passed for history.\"</ref> The Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill controlled the north-western part of Ireland, and was divided into two leading branches, the [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]] in the west and [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]], also known as the kingdom of [[Ailech]]. Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain had become the more powerful of the two in 789,<ref name=\"OCorV&I_p2\"/> and had expanded east and southwards, gaining control over the important monastic centre [[Armagh]] and the large sub-kingdom of [[Airg\u00edalla]]. The traditional kingdom of Ulaid, dominated by [[D\u00e1l Fiatach]] and [[D\u00e1l nAraidi]], was now more or less confined to the area east of the [[river Bann]].\n\nThe central region of Mide had been dominated by what became known as the \"southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\" since the 7th century. Until the 8th century, the [[S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine]] (also known as the kingdom of Brega) was pre-eminent, but from 728 the western dynasty of [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] was dominant.\n\nIn Laigin, [[U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge]] was the dominant dynasty c. 800. They were closely associated with the large monastery of [[Kildare]]. Their main rival for dominance in Leinster, the [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] had not been able to claim the title [[List of Kings of Leinster|king of Leinster]] since 728. The U\u00ed Cheinnselaig now controlled a territory in the south-eastern part of Leinster, and had close links to the monastery of [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]].\n\nThe [[kingdom of Osraige]], occupying roughly the same area as the present [[County Kilkenny]] and western [[County Laois]], was considered part of Munster until the late ninth century, when it received an independent status under king [[Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge]]. Munster was dominated by the [[E\u00f3ganachta]], centred around [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] and with [[Emly]] as ecclesiastical centre. The [[D\u00e1l gCais]] (not yet known under this name) had defeated the [[Corcu Modruad]] in 744 and taken control over the area in present [[County Clare]] from which they would later rise to dominance, but were not yet a significant power in Munster. The E\u00f3ganachta rivalled the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill in power and influence, and claimed suzerainty over the southern part of Ireland. This claim was in part anchored within the legendary ancient division of the island in [[Leath Cuinn|Leath Cuinn and Leath Moga]], \"[[Conn of the Hundred Battles|Conn]]'s half\" (north) and \"[[Mug Nuadat|Mug]]'s half\" (south).\n\nDuring the 7th century the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain]] had emerged in Connacht, and since the first half of the 8th century been the dominant dynasty. U\u00ed Bri\u00fain also influenced the [[kingdom of Breifne]] on the southern borders of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.\n\n==First Viking age (795\u2013902)==\n\n===Early Viking raids===\n{{See also|Early Scandinavian Dublin#Early Viking raids}}\nThe early Vikings were a group of people who originated in modern-day Denmark and Norway. In the 700s, pressure on land in Scandinavia had forced many nobles and warriors to seek land elsewhere. Some of these were younger sons, who stood to inherit nothing of their father's estate. Noblemen with little to lose began to gather together groups of warriors and go down the coast pillaging settlements.\n{{Rquote|right|''The wind is fierce tonight<br />it tosses the sea's white mane<br />I do not fear the coursing of a quiet sea<br />by the fierce warriors of Lothlend|Anonymous poem ''[[Is acher in ga\u00edth in-nocht...]]''}}\nThe first recorded [[Viking]] raid in Irish history occurred in AD [[795 in Ireland|795]] when Vikings, possibly from [[Norway]]<ref name=\"Woolfp47\">[[#Woolf07|Woolf, Alex ''From Pictland to Alba'', p. 47.]] Woolf \"constructs a plausible narrative\" based on an entry in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' where these early raiders can be identified as originating on the west-coast of Norway.</ref> looted the island of [[Lambay Island|Lambay]].<ref group=\"note\">[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, ''The Vikings & Ireland'', p. 9.]] The annals name the site of this attack as ''Rechru'', a name that could mean either modern Lambay Island or [[Rathlin Island|Rathlin]].</ref> This was followed by a raid on the coast of [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] in 798, and raids on the coast of [[Connacht]] in 807.<ref>[[#ByrneRIAxvi|Byrne, F.J.

The Vikings would have then sailed down the Atlantic coast of [[Scotland]], and then over to Ireland.<ref name=\"Woolfp47\"/> During these early raids the Vikings also travelled to the west coast of Ireland to the [[Skellig Islands]] located off the coast of [[County Kerry]].

The Vikings were beginning to establish fortified encampments, ''[[longports]]'', along the Irish coast and overwintering in Ireland instead of retreating to [[Scandinavia]] or [[Great Britain|British]] bases. The first known longports were at ''Linn D\u00faachaill'' ([[Annagassan]]) and ''Duiblinn'' (on the [[River Liffey]], at or near present [[Dublin]]).<ref>[[#OCor2001|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings in Ireland\"]], p. 19.</ref><ref group=\"note\">The first report of Vikings spending the winter in Ireland is from [[Lough Neagh]] 840\u201341, the first overwintered in Dublin 841\u201342.</ref> They were also moving further inland to attack, often using rivers such as the Shannon, and then retreating to their coastal bases. The raiding parties also increased in size, becoming regular armies\u2014in 837 the annals report a fleet of sixty [[longship]]s on the Liffey, carrying 1,500 men, and another one of a similar size sailing up the river Boyne, making their way into the inland territories and launching attacks on the lands of Brega in the south of County Meath.<ref>[[#AU|AU 873.3]], [[#OCor2001|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings in Ireland\"]], p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"ancient.eu\">https://www.ancient.eu/article/1162/the-vikings-in-ireland/</ref> In general, from 837 onward larger Viking forces hit larger targets \u2013 such as the greater monastic towns of Armagh, Glendalough, Kildare, Slane, Clonard, Clonmacnoise, and Lismore \u2013 while smaller targets such as local churches with less material to be plundered may have escaped the Vikings' attention.<ref name=\"ancient.eu\"/>\n\n[[File:Vidfamne-01.jpg|thumb|Modern replica of a Viking [[Knarr]].]]\nOne of the first named Viking leaders was [[Thorgest]] (in Latin ''Turgesius''). The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] connect him with attacks on [[Connacht]], [[Mide]] and the church at [[Clonmacnoise]] in 844.<ref>[[#AFM|AFM 843.13]]</ref> He was captured and drowned in [[Lough Owel]] by [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Ma\u00edl Ruanaid]], [[Kings of Mide|King of Mide]].<ref>[[#AU|AU 845.8]]</ref> However the existence of [[Thorgest]] is uncertain as he was recorded in books written over 200 years after his death in a period of strong anti-Viking sentiment. He was often depicted as a villain and his wife was said to be a witch that would perform pagan rituals on altars. It is highly likely that this was war propaganda as we have very little evidence of his existence from his own period, and it is unlikely those close to him would record this themselves.\n\nIn [[848 in Ireland|848]] a Norse army was defeated at Sciath Nechtain by [[\u00d3lchobar mac Cin\u00e1eda]] of Munster and [[Lorc\u00e1n mac Cellaig]] of Leinster. For the first time the leader of the Vikings is described as royalty from [[Lochlann]].<ref>[[#AU|AU 848.5]]</ref> M\u00e1el Sechnaill, now High King, defeated another army at ''Forrach'' the same year.<ref>[[#AU|AU 848.4]]</ref> These victories form the background of an embassy sent to the Frankish emperor [[Charles the Bald]], reported in the [[Annales Bertiniani]].<ref>[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Vikings & Ireland\"]], p. 16.</ref>\n\nIn 853 [[Olaf the White|Olaf]], identified as a \"son of the king of Lochlann\",<ref>[[#AU|AU 853.2]], \"Amhlaim m. righ Laithlinde...\"</ref> came to Ireland.

Olaf and Ivar remained active in Ireland and around the [[Irish Sea]] for the next two decades. The descendants of Ivar, the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]], would be an important political factor for the next two centuries.\n\n===Shifting alliances and struggle for power===\nA significant new trait from the middle of the 9th century was that the Norse now also entered alliances with various Irish rulers. [[Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge]] had become king of Osraige in 842. Cerball had defeated Viking raiders in 846 and 847, but from 858 he is allied with Olaf and Ivar against M\u00e1el Sechnaill, campaigning in Leinster and Munster, and in 859 also raiding M\u00e1el Sechnaill's heartlands in Mide, though Cerball had to submit to M\u00e1el Sechnaill later the same year. These alliances were by no means permanent. In 860 Cerball was allied ''with'' M\u00e1el Sechnaill in a campaign against [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, while Olaf and Ivar has allied themselves with \u00c1ed. In 870, however, Cerball and \u00c1ed appeared as allies in Leinster.\n\nM\u00e1el Sechnaill had more success as high king than his predecessors Niall Caille and Conchobar Donnchada (Duncan) in dealing with the south, and forced Munster into submission in 858 and as noted above, Osraige in 859. He also asserted control over Ulaid, Leinster and Connacht, and was in his obituary in the Annals of Ulster described as ''ri h-Erenn uile'', king of all Ireland. The last years of his reign he had however experienced serious opposition from his U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kinsmen of Ailech and Brega, allied with the Norse of Dublin. [[Francis John Byrne|Byrne]] notes: \"M\u00e1el Sechnaill's unprecedented success in achieving the high-kingship of all Ireland was marred by the chronic complaint of Irish politics: having united the Ulaid, Munster, Osraige, Connacht and Leinster, he was attacked at the end of his reign by a combination of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kings.\"<ref>[[#ByrneRIAxvi|Byrne, \"The Viking Age\"]], p. 617.</ref>\n\n\u00c1ed Findliath was king of Ailech and the leading king within the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. After the death of M\u00e1el Sechnaill he is counted in the regal lists as high king, following the established scheme where this alternated between Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain in the north and Clann Cholm\u00e1in of Mide. His kingship was disputed though, and he did not come close to being an actual king over Ireland. He could count some successes against the Norse, however, most notably burning all the Norse longports in the north in 866.<ref>[[#AU|AU 866.8]]</ref> \u00c1ed seems to have used the opportunity while Olaf was involved in warfare in [[Pictland]], presumably bringing a large contingent of the Norse forces in Ireland with him. The Vikings never managed to establish permanent settlements in the north. [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] observes: \"Ironically, [\u00c1ed Findliath's] success may have held back the economic development of the north and ultimately prevented the growth of port towns like those on the east and south coasts, on which the Leinster and Munster kings subsequently depended for much of their wealth.\"<ref>[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Vikings & Ireland\"]], p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe last report of Olaf is when he and Ivar returned to Dublin in 871 from [[Alba]].<ref>[[#AU|AU 871.2]]</ref> Ivar died in 873.

Flandacain co feraibh Bregh  & o Cerball m. Muiricain co Laignibh...\", that is \"longport\", not \"fortress\".</ref>\n\nA group of Vikings led by Hingamund who were forced out of Ireland were given permission by the Saxons to settle in [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], in the north west of England. \"The Three Fragments\" refers to a distinct group of settlers living among these Vikings as \"Irishmen\": \"Then the King, who was on the point of death, and the Queen sent messengers to the Irishmen who were among the pagans, for there were many Irish among the pagans, to say to the Irishmen, life and health to you from the King of the Saxons, who is in disease, and from his Queen, who has all authority over the Saxons, and they are certain that you are true and trusty friends to them. Therefore you should take their side; for they did not bestow any greater honour to a Saxon warror or cleric than to each warrior and cleric who came to them from Ireland, because this inimical race of pagans is equally hostile to you also.\" Further evidence of an Irish presence in Wirral comes from the name of the village of [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]] in Wirral, which means \"farmstead of the Irishmen\", and [[St Bridget's Church, West Kirby]] which is known to have been founded by \"Christian Vikings from Ireland\".<ref>[http://saintpatrickscrossliverpool.webs.com/ Irish Migration to Merseyside]</ref><ref>[http://www.stbridgetschurch.org.uk/ St Bridget's Church West Kirby]</ref>\n\n=== Failed Conquest ===\nThe Vikings were able to exploit internal divisions in order to invade England and France. As Ireland was one of the most politically fractured countries at the time, it was a prime target for Viking conquest. Furthermore, Irish Kings often made alliances with foreign invaders in an attempt to weaken their domestic rivals. The Vikings were able to defeat the centralized Kingdoms of Europe, since the small ruling class was easily removed. However, Ireland was composed of more than 150 different Kingdoms ruling over small territories. This decentralized system of governance made it almost impossible to gain control of a territory, since defeated Kings were easily replaced.\n\n===Impact on cultural activity and formation of Irish scholarly diaspora===\nHistorians debate the consequences that the initial phases of Viking settlement had on scholarship and literary output.<ref>[[#FlechnerMeeder2016Conclusion|Flechner and Meeder (2016), ''The Irish in Early Medieval Europe'']], pp. 231\u201341.</ref> Scholarly activity, for which the Irish are famous in the early Medieval period, consisted of the writing of poetry, the production of Christian devotional texts, the development of the science of [[computus]], and the compilation of elaborate law tracts.<ref>[[#Johnston2013|Johnston (2013), ''Literacy and Identity in Early Medieval Ireland'']], pp. 27\u201358.</ref> Patronage for scholars and scholarship came largely from Irish kings who regarded the presence of court scholars as part and parcel of the trappings of kingship, but also as a means of bolstering their own image through praise poetry that such scholars composed and performed. With the advent of the Vikings, patronage ties have been argued to have been loosened, thereby affecting directly the livelihood of Irish scholars. In addition, some kings would have turned their attention to more pressing (but also more profitable) pursuits, such as engaging in warfare or alliances with Vikings or other Irish kings, as well as tapping the economic benefits that Viking trade would have brought. While this was happening in Ireland, we observe a more pronounced presence of Irish scholars in Frankish Europe, and especially in circles associated with the [[Carolingian]] court. Commonly known as [[Irish Diaspora|''peregrini'']], Irish scholars such as [[John Scottus Eriugena]] and [[Sedulius Scottus]] became among the most prominent and influential in ninth-century continental Europe, studying and teaching a range of subjects, from theology to political philosophy. It is tempting to link their presence on the Continent as well as the presence of scores of other Irish learned people with the impact of the Vikings on Ireland, which may have driven such people to seek employment elsewhere.

Norse influence shows in the Norse-derived names of many contemporary Irish kings (e.g. Magnus, Lochlann or Sitric), and in DNA evidence in some residents of these coastal cities to this day. A genetics paper in 2006 by Dr Brian McEvoy found that most men with Irish-Viking surnames carried typically Irish genes. This suggests that Viking settlements may have had a Scandinavian elite but with most of the inhabitants being indigenous Irish.<ref>[[#EJHG|McEvoy&al., EJHG article]]</ref>\n\nNiall Gl\u00fandub marched on Dublin in September 919, but Sihtric met his forces at the [[battle of Islandbridge]] or ''\u00c1th Cliath'' and inflicted on him a decisive defeat, with Niall and numerous other Irish leaders among the casualties. Dublin was secured for the Norse, and in 920 Sitric left for York and following Ragnall's death succeeded him as ruler there in 921. Their kinsman [[Gofraid ua \u00cdmair|Gofraid]] assumed control of Dublin. Gofraid was active as a Viking raider and slaver, but there were signs during his reign that the Norse were not just mere Vikings any more.

He was driven out by [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], and returned to Dublin half a year later. The Vikings of Limerick had taken Dublin in his absence. Gofraid retook the city, but the struggle between Limerick continued well after Gofraid's death in 934. He was succeeded by his son, [[Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Amla\u00edb]], who inflicted a decisive defeat on Limerick in 937. The same year Amla\u00edb went to Northumbria and allied himself with [[Constantine II of Scotland]] and [[Owen I of Strathclyde]]. Athelstan defeated this coalition at [[Battle of Brunanburh|Brunanburh]] (937), but after Athelstan's death in 939 Amla\u00edb became king of York. He was joined by a kinsman with the same name, [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n|Amla\u00edb]] son of Sihtric, known as ''Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n''.\n\n[[Congalach mac M\u00e1el Mithig]], known as ''Cnogba'', succeeded (Duncan) Donnchad Donn as U\u00ed N\u00e9ill overking in 944 (Muirchertag, who otherwise might have been the obvious successor, had been killed in 943). Congalach was king of Brega and a member of [[S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine]], and the first of this dynasty called \"High King\" since [[Cin\u00e1ed mac \u00cdrgalaig]] in the early 8th century. In 944 he sacked Dublin, now ruled by [[Bl\u00e1caire mac Gofrith]]. When Amla\u00edb Cuaran returned to Ireland the next year, he became ruler of Dublin and acted as an ally of Congalach in the struggle against [[Ruaidr\u00ed ua Canann\u00e1in]], a rival U\u00ed N\u00e9ill claimant for High Kingship from [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]]. This alliance did not last long after Ruaidr\u00ed's death in 950, however, and Congalach was killed in 956 in a battle against an alliance of Dublin and Leinster. He was succeeded by [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]], and in the following decades alliances shifted constantly between the different branches of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, Leinster and Dublin.\n\nIn 980 [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] succeeded Domnall, and the same year he defeated the forces of Dublin at the [[Battle of Tara (Ireland)|battle of Tara]]. Following this victory M\u00e1el Sechnaill forced Dublin into submission, and his half-brother, Amla\u00edbs son [[Gl\u00faniairn]], became ruler in Dublin.\n\n==M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill and Brian Boru (980\u20131022)==\n[[File:Brian Boru, King of Munster.jpg|thumb|18th-century [[engraving]] of [[Brian Boru]].]]\nIn Munster, the influence of the [[Dal gCais]] had grown under [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in]], and his son [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]] was the first non-[[E\u00f3ganachta]] ruler to be named by the annals as king of Cashel (i.e. king of Munster) in historical times.<ref name=\"ODNBBrian\">[[#ODNBBrian|Duffy, ''Brian B\u00f3ruma'']]</ref> He was killed in 976, and succeeded by his brother [[Brian Boru|Brian]], later famously known as ''Brian Boru''.\n\nBrian quickly established himself as the most powerful ruler in Munster, defeating the Norse of Limerick in 977 and the E\u00f3ganachta the following year. Having gained control over Munster, he tried to extend his authority by raiding Osraige in 982 and 983, and also, according to the [[annals of Innisfallen]], entering an alliance with the Norse of [[Waterford]], with the intention of attacking Dublin.<ref name=\"ODNBBrian\"/> There was such an attack, but Brian does not seem to have been involved \u2013 instead it was [[Domnall Claen]] of Leinster who was allied with [[Ivar of Waterford]], and they were defeated by Gl\u00faniairn and M\u00e1el Sechnaill.\n\nM\u00e1el Sechnaill obviously perceived Brian as a threat, and as early as 982 raided Munster and the territory of the Dal gCais. The next two decades saw more or less constant warfare between them, mostly with Leinster as their battleground. Even if Brian never defeated M\u00e1el Sechnaill in battle, Brian's and Munster's influence was growing at the expense of M\u00e1el Sechnaill and the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. In 997 M\u00e1el Sechnaill was forced to acknowledge Brian's authority over the south of Ireland, and they formally divided Ireland according to the traditional scheme of [[Leath Cuinn|Leath Cuinn and Leath Moga]]. In the years that followed, the two of them acted as allies in accordance with this agreement. In 999 Brian quelled a revolt against him by the men of Leinster and Dublin at the [[battle of Glen Mama]], and only restored [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]] as ruler of Dublin after he had formally submitted to Brian by handing over hostages.<ref name=\"ODNBBrian\"/>\n\nIn 1000, Brian turned against M\u00e1el Sechnaill, and by 1002 he had forced M\u00e1el Sechnaill to submit to him, and now claimed kingship over the whole of Ireland. In the following decade, there were several campaigns in the north to force the Ulaid and the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill into submission as well. Even if faced with multiple rebellions, both in the north and in Leinster, by 1011 he had received submission from every major regional king in Ireland, and thus earned the recognition by historians as the first real ''king of Ireland''.<ref name=\"Jaski05Brian\">[[#Jaski05Brian|Jaski, Brian Boru]]</ref> During his visit to Armagh in 1005, he had his secretary add a note to the [[Book of Armagh]] where he is proclaimed as ''Imperator Scottorum'' (emperor of the Irish). According to Bart Jaski, \"This can be regarded as a claim that he ruled both the Irish and the Norse in Ireland, and may even imply suzerainty over the Gaels of Scotland\".<ref name=\"Jaski05Brian\"/> In his obituary in the Annals of Ulster he is styled as \"over-king of the Irish of Ireland, and of the foreigners and of the Britons, the Augustus of the whole of north-west Europe\".<ref>[[#AU|AU 1014.2]], \"ardr\u00ed Gaidhel Erenn & Gall & Bretan, August iartair tuaiscirt Eorpa uile\"</ref>\n\nIn 1012, [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]] revolted against Brian, and the following year [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada|M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda]] of Leinster and Sigtrygg of Dublin did too. The latter led to the famous [[battle of Clontarf]], where Brian was killed, even if his army was victorious over M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda, Sigtrygg and their allies. [[Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Earl of Orkney]] as well as forces from [[Isle of Man|Man]] participated on the Dublin/ Leinster side, and this may, in conjunction with the propagandistic account of the battle given in the Cogad, have created the still popular myth that what took place at Clontarf [[Good Friday]] 1014 was a decisive battle where the Irish defeated Viking invaders and were liberated from oppression (Duncan) [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] was one of the first to publicly debunk this national myth, in his groundbreaking ''Ireland before the Normans'' from 1972:\n{{quote|The battle of Clontarf was not a struggle between the Irish and the Norse for the sovereignty of Ireland; neither was it a great national victory which broke the power of the Norse forever (long before Clontarf the Norse had become a minor political force in Irish affairs).

Though Donnchad (Duncan) eventually was victorious, the descendants of Brian would not be able to make a real claim to kingship over Ireland again until [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]]. In Leinster, the defeat at Clontarf and death of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda seriously weakened the [[U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge]], and opened the way for a new [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] dominance in the region.

When he wrote in 1056 he evidently did not know any high king of Ireland, and instead lists a number of kings of the day: (Duncan) Conchobar, \u00c1ed, Garbith, Diarmait, Donnchad (Duncan) and two Nialls. According to Byrne, these are Conchobar Ua Ma\u00edl Schechnaill of Mide, [[\u00c1ed in Gai Bernaig|\u00c1ed Ua Conchobair]] of Connacht, Garb\u00edth Ua Cathassaig of Brega, [[Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3]] of Leinster, Donnchad (Duncan) Mac Briain of Munster, Niall mac M\u00e1el Sechnaill of Ailech and [[Niall mac Eochada]] of Ulaid.<ref name=Byrnep866/>\n\nThe term ''r\u00ed \u00c9renn co fressarba'' (\"High kings with opposition\") was used from the 12th century.

Niall and Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3 became allies, and effectively controlled the whole east coast of Ireland. This alliance helped to make it possible for Diarmait to take direct control of Dublin in 1052. Unlike M\u00e1el Sechnaill in 980 or Brian in 999, he wasn't content with just looting the city and expelling the Hiberno-Norse ruler ([[Echmarcach mac Ragnaill]]); in an unprecedented move he assumed the kingship \"of the foreigners\" (''r\u00edge Gall'') himself.<ref>[[#Duffy92|Duffy, Irishmen and Islesmen]], p. 94.</ref>\n{{expand section|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Reform of the Irish Church==\n[[File:St. Malachy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Malachy]] was an influential 12th-century reformist ecclesiastic in Ireland.]]\n{{See also|Synod of Rathbreasail|Synod of Kells-Mellifont}}\nThere were major reforms in the Irish church during the 12th century. These reforms have been generally interpreted as a reaction to previous secularisation, but could also be seen as a continuous development.<ref>[[#HughesRIAxvii|Hughes, The Irish Church, 800 \u2013 c. 1050]], p. 655, note 70.</ref> The reforms had consequences for, and were influenced by, relations within the church as well as secular politics.\n\nBefore the 11th century the church in Ireland was [[monastic]], with bishops residing at monasteries and without a permanent [[diocese|diocesan]] structure. The circumstances surrounding the foundation of the diocese of Dublin early in the century are obscure, but at some point during the reign of Sithric Silkbeard [[Donat, Bishop of Dublin|D\u00fan\u00e1n]] became [[Bishop of Dublin]], thus establishing the first proper diocese in Ireland. His successor [[Gilla P\u00e1traic]] was consecrated by [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and on that occasion Lanfranc sent letters to Toirdelbach Ua Briain and [[Gofraid mac Amlaib mac Ragnaill|Gofraid]] urging reforms, in particular regarding the consecration of bishops and the abolition of [[simony]]. There is no evidence of Canterbury claiming primacy over the church in Ireland prior to this, and neither Lanfranc nor [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] ever made direct primatial claims for Canterbury in relation to the Irish church.<ref>[[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan]], p. 913.</ref>\n\nToirdelbach appears to have responded favourably to this, and convened a synod in Dublin in 1080<ref>[[#Holland05reform|Holland, Church reforms]]</ref> \u2013 the outcome of this synod is not known. Toirdelbach may have seen cooperation with Canterbury as a way to reduce the influence from Armagh, traditionally dominated by Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain, within the church in Ireland. Gilla P\u00e1traic's successors [[Donngus Ua hAingliu]] and [[Samuel Ua h\u00c1ingliu]] were also consecrated in Canterbury, and so was the first bishop of Waterford, [[M\u00e1el \u00cdsu Ua hAinmire]] in 1096. The written request for M\u00e1el \u00cdsu's consecration, as preserved in [[Eadmer]]'s ''Historia Novorum'', is subscribed by bishops from Munster, Mide, Dublin and Leinster.<ref>[[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan]], pp. 911\u201312</ref> [[Gilla Espaic]], the first bishop of Limerick, was however not consecrated in Canterbury, but probably by [[Ceallach of Armagh|Cellach]] of Armagh.<ref group=\"note\">Gilla received a letter from Anselm congratulating him on his elevation to the see of Limerick, and there was no suggestion that Anselm felt Canterbury had been slighted or ought to have been involved.

How many who actually attended this synod is not known, but some of its decrees have been preserved. There is a decree on simony, on prohibition for laymen to become ''airchinnig'' (heads of ecclesiastical establishments) and finally a decree that defines what relationships are considered to be incestuous. None of these decrees are radical, but they are generally interpreted to be in line with the [[Gregorian reform]].<ref>[[#Holland05Cashel1|Holland, Cashel, synod of I (1101)]]</ref>\n\nThe second synod was the [[Synod of Rathbreasail]]. This synod, presided by Gilla Espaic<ref>[[#Holland05Gille|Holland, Gille (Gilbert) of Limerick]]</ref> as [[papal legate]] and attended by fifty bishops, three hundred priests and over three thousand laymen, marked the transition of the Irish church from a monastic to a diocesan and parish-based church. It established two provinces, with archbishoprics at Armagh and Cashel, and prominence given to Armagh, making Cellach the primate of the church in Ireland. Each province consisted of twelve territorial dioceses. The see of Dublin was not included, as this was under primacy from Canterbury,<ref group=\"note\">The see of Waterford however, where the incumbent bishop M\u00e1el \u00cdsu Ua hAinmire also had been consecrated in, and taken vows of obedience to, Canterbury, was moved to Lismore, and M\u00e1el \u00cdsu chosen as the first archbishop of Cashel.</ref> but a place was left open for it, in the sense that only eleven dioceses were declared under Cashel.\n\nGilla, Cellach and Cellach's successor M\u00e1el M\u00e1ed\u00f3c Ua Morgair, better known as [[St. Malachy]], drove the reform process onwards. Malachy, in close cooperation with (Duncan) [[Donnchad Ua Cerbaill]], king of Fernmag/Airgialla, established the first Irish [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] house at [[Mellifont]] in 1142, and also facilitated the first [[Augustinian]] community of the [[Arrouaise|Arrouaisian]] observance. Malachy used these as agencies of monastic reform within the Irish church.<ref>[[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan]], p. 923.</ref> Malachy resigned as archbishop of Armagh in 1136, but was appointed native papal legate to Ireland by [[Pope Innocent II|Innocent II]] in 1139.\n\n[[File:Dioceses of Medieval Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Maps of dioceses in Ireland as defined by the synod of Kells.

This first bid was unsuccessful, but Malachy was told to reapply after he had gained the agreement of all Ireland.<ref>[[#Holland05reform|Holland, Church reform]]</ref> Before undertaking his second trip to the Continent in 1148, Malachy convened a synod at [[St Patrick's Island]]. The main challenge must have been to reach an accommodation with Dublin, and [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]], presently the most powerful king in Ireland, was eager to increase Connacht influence on the church. The solution reached was to extend the number of metropolitan sees from two to four, with [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Tuam]] and Dublin included alongside Cashel and Armagh. Malachy died on his way to meet the pope, but the message was transmitted by other means and papal approval was granted. [[Pope Eugene III]] appointed cardinal [[Giovanni Paparoni|John Paparo]] as papal legate, and sent him to Ireland with pallia for the four archbishops.\n\nCardinal Paparo's first attempt to reach Ireland was stalled when king [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] refused him safe conduct through England unless he pledged himself to do nothing in Ireland that would injure England's interests there. This was not acceptable for Paparo, who returned to Rome. It seems likely that this was an attempt by Stephen to prevent Paparo from bringing papal confirmation for an arrangement in Ireland that would finally extinguish Canterbury's claims in Ireland.<ref>[[#Holland05Kells|Holland, Synod of Kells]], p. 247.</ref> In 1151 he returned and this time reached Ireland, his journey being facilitated by [[David I of Scotland]]. The [[Synod of Kells-Mellifont]] was convened in 1152, with Paparo presiding as papal legate.

The first two centuries of this period are characterised by Viking raids and the subsequent [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements along the coast. Viking ports were established at [[Dublin]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Limerick]], which became the first large towns in [[Ireland]].\n\nIreland consisted of many semi-independent [[t\u00faatha]], and during the entire period, attempts were made by various factions to gain political control over the whole of the island. For the first two centuries of this period, this was mainly a rivalry between putative [[High Kings of Ireland]] from the northern and southern branches of the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. The one who came closest to being de facto king over the whole of Ireland, however, was [[Brian Boru]], the first high king in this period not belonging to the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.\n\nFollowing Brian's death at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, the political situation became more complex with rivalry for high kingship from several clans and dynasties. Brian's descendants failed to maintain a unified throne, and regional squabbling over territory led indirectly to the invasion of the [[Normans]] under [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]] in [[1169 in Ireland|1169]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Eoin MacNeill.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Eoin MacNeill]], one of the pioneers in modern studies of Irish medieval history]]\nDue to the rich amount of written sources, the study of Irish history 800\u20131169 has, to a large extent, focused on gathering, interpretation and [[textual criticism]] of these. Only recently have other sources of historical knowledge received more attention, particularly [[archaeology]]. Since the modern excavations of [[Dublin]] started in 1961, followed by similar efforts in [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]] and [[Limerick]], great advances have been made in the understanding of the physical character of the towns established during this period.<ref>[[#WallaceRIA|Wallace, The archaeology...]], pp. 814\u201315.</ref>\n\nThe first part of the period from 800 to 1014 is well-studied; the \"Viking age\" has attracted the interest of historians for quite some time. The period between 1014 and 1169 has received less attention. In the words of Sean Duffy, this period\n<blockquote>has \u2013 historiographically speaking \u2013 fallen between two stools. Historians of early medieval Ireland, seeking to conclude their narratives on a high note, have traditionally done so after recounting the death of the famous high-king Brian B\u00f3rama (Boru) at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. On the other hand, historians of later medieval Ireland generally choose to begin proceedings with the English invasion of the 1160s. Eleventh- and early twelfth-century Ireland has, therefore, often assumed the character of a snappy epilogue or a lengthy prologue.<ref>[[#Duffy09|Duffy, Ireland, c. 1000 \u2013 c. 1100]], p. 285.</ref><ref group=\"note\">See also [[#McNeill|McNeill, \"Archaeology\"]], \"The 150 years before 1200 have been lost, between the assumptions that life was a continuation of the fifth through eighth-century world and that the incursion of English lords marked a fundamental change throughout Ireland.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn trying to interpret the history of early Ireland, one of the most frequently asked questions addressed by historians is how early it is possible to speak of an Irish nation, a ''natio'' encompassing the whole island of Ireland. Early poet-historians like [[Flann Mainistrech]] constructed a history of a monarchy of all Ireland going back to and beyond St Patrick. Only a hundred years after Mainistrech, [[Gerald of Wales]] described the Irish society in his [[Topographia Hibernica]] as utterly primitive and savage. At the beginning of modern scholarly interpretation of Irish history, [[Eoin MacNeill]] and [[G.H. Orpen]] came to opposite conclusions analyzing the same period. Orpen saw an anarchic country still in 'a tribal state'; he could see no ''natio'', no wider community in Ireland than the tribe. MacNeill stressed the reality of the high-kingship of Ireland and the existence of many of those institutions of government which Orpen found wanting, and claimed that Irish law had a national character.<ref>[[#OCorNation|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Nationality and Kingship...\"]]</ref>\n\n==Nature of the written sources==\n[[File:Book of Leinster, folio 53.jpg|thumb|right|Folio 53 from the ''[[Book of Leinster]]'']]\n\nA large body of contemporary and near-contemporary material on early medieval Ireland has survived. From the titles of works mentioned in these sources, it is clear that a great deal of additional material has now been lost. The surviving materials usually exist in the form of much later copies, and it is only from comparison of the various texts that the original documents can be reconstructed.<ref>[[#Hughes72|Hughes, ''Early Christian Ireland'']], is a general survey of the subject.</ref>\n\nExtant [[Irish annals]] are ultimately derived from the now-lost [[Chronicle of Ireland]] which was probably being compiled in the midlands of Ireland by around 800. All include material derived from other sources, or added at a later date. The ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'' cover most of this period, but have a gap between 1132 and 1155. The ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'' survive only in an eccentric 17th-century English translation, and the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' for this period are lost with [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]]'s abbreviated copy known as the ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' supplying only part of the missing material. The ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' are late, and include some material of doubtful origin. While the annals provide a considerable amount of information, they are generally terse, and most focus their attention on the doings of the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] and of churchmen.<ref>[[#Hughes72|Hughes, ''Early Christian Ireland'']], chapter 4, especially pp. 135\u201337.; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. xix.; [[#OCroRIAvii|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, \"Ireland 400\u2013800\"]], ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the annals, a large number of genealogies survive, along with geographical and legal texts, poetry, sagas and hagiography.\n\nIn the 12th century, propaganda text like [[Caithr\u00e9im Chellach\u00e1in Chaisil]] and [[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]] were composed. Even though the historical accuracy of these accounts is dubious, the Cogad especially has had a great impact on the interpretation of Irish medieval history until recently.<ref>[[#Breatnach2005|Breatnach, \"Historical tales\"]]</ref>\n\n==Political landscape c. 800==\n{{further|Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland}}\n\nAt the end of the 8th century, Ireland was homogeneously [[Gaels|Gaelic]] in terms of society, culture and language. People lived in rural communities, and the only larger settlements were monastic towns of varying sizes. The monasteries played an important part in society, not just with regards to religious and cultural life, but also to economy and politics. [[Christianization]] had begun in the 5th century, and by the early 9th century the island was almost entirely Christian. However, the ''[[Martyrology of Tallaght]]'' (written sometime in the 8th or 9th century) hints that [[Celtic paganism|paganism]] had not yet been fully uprooted.\n\n[[File:Ireland early peoples and politics.gif|thumb|300px|Peoples and subdivisions of early Ireland]]\n[[Eoin MacNeill]] identified the \"oldest certain fact in the political history of Ireland\" as the existence in late prehistory of a pentarchy, probably consisting of the ''c\u00f3iceda'' or \"fifths\" of the [[Ulaid]] (Ulster), the [[Connachta]] (Connacht), the [[Laigin]] (Leinster), Mumu ([[Munster]]) and [[Kingdom of Mide|Mide]] (Meath), although some accounts discount Mide and split Mumu in two.<ref>Eoin MacNeill, ''Phases of Irish History'', Dublin, 1920, pp. 98\u2013132.</ref> This is not an accurate description of the political landscape c. 800,<ref>[[#OCroRIAvii|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, D\u00e1ibhi (2005) Ireland, 400\u2013800]] pp. 187\u201388.</ref><ref group=\"note\">\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn also points out the irony of \"at no time in the historical period did the political division represented by the word ''c\u00f3iced''... ...have a tangible existence\"</ref> but when discussing the political subdivisions of Ireland at this time, it is still useful to refer to this system; if Laigin and Mide are combined as Leinster, it roughly corresponds with the modern [[Provinces of Ireland|four provinces of Ireland]].\n\nThe [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], divided in two main branches known as \"Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\" and \"Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\", was the leading dynasty in Ireland.<ref name=\"OCorV&I_p2\">[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings & Ireland\"]], p. 2.</ref><ref group=\"note\">They may not have been as dominant in earlier history as medieval sources tend to claim, according to [[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings & Ireland\"]] they :\"paraded illustrious ancestors and their claim to precedence was expressed in an elaborate mythography that passed for history.\"</ref> The Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill controlled the north-western part of Ireland, and was divided into two leading branches, the [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]] in the west and [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]], also known as the kingdom of [[Ailech]]. Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain had become the more powerful of the two in 789,<ref name=\"OCorV&I_p2\"/> and had expanded east and southwards, gaining control over the important monastic centre [[Armagh]] and the large sub-kingdom of [[Airg\u00edalla]]. The traditional kingdom of Ulaid, dominated by [[D\u00e1l Fiatach]] and [[D\u00e1l nAraidi]], was now more or less confined to the area east of the [[river Bann]].\n\nThe central region of Mide had been dominated by what became known as the \"southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\" since the 7th century. Until the 8th century, the [[S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine]] (also known as the kingdom of Brega) was pre-eminent, but from 728 the western dynasty of [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] was dominant.\n\nIn Laigin, [[U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge]] was the dominant dynasty c. 800. They were closely associated with the large monastery of [[Kildare]]. Their main rival for dominance in Leinster, the [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] had not been able to claim the title [[List of Kings of Leinster|king of Leinster]] since 728. The U\u00ed Cheinnselaig now controlled a territory in the south-eastern part of Leinster, and had close links to the monastery of [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]].\n\nThe [[kingdom of Osraige]], occupying roughly the same area as the present [[County Kilkenny]] and western [[County Laois]], was considered part of Munster until the late ninth century, when it received an independent status under king [[Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge]]. Munster was dominated by the [[E\u00f3ganachta]], centred around [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]] and with [[Emly]] as ecclesiastical centre. The [[D\u00e1l gCais]] (not yet known under this name) had defeated the [[Corcu Modruad]] in 744 and taken control over the area in present [[County Clare]] from which they would later rise to dominance, but were not yet a significant power in Munster. The E\u00f3ganachta rivalled the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill in power and influence, and claimed suzerainty over the southern part of Ireland. This claim was in part anchored within the legendary ancient division of the island in [[Leath Cuinn|Leath Cuinn and Leath Moga]], \"[[Conn of the Hundred Battles|Conn]]'s half\" (north) and \"[[Mug Nuadat|Mug]]'s half\" (south).\n\nDuring the 7th century the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain]] had emerged in Connacht, and since the first half of the 8th century been the dominant dynasty. U\u00ed Bri\u00fain also influenced the [[kingdom of Breifne]] on the southern borders of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.\n\n==First Viking age (795\u2013902)==\n\n===Early Viking raids===\n{{See also|Early Scandinavian Dublin#Early Viking raids}}\nThe early Vikings were a group of people who originated in modern-day Denmark and Norway. In the 700s, pressure on land in Scandinavia had forced many nobles and warriors to seek land elsewhere. Some of these were younger sons, who stood to inherit nothing of their father's estate. Noblemen with little to lose began to gather together groups of warriors and go down the coast pillaging settlements.\n{{Rquote|right|''The wind is fierce tonight<br />it tosses the sea's white mane<br />I do not fear the coursing of a quiet sea<br />by the fierce warriors of Lothlend|Anonymous poem ''[[Is acher in ga\u00edth in-nocht...]]''}}\nThe first recorded [[Viking]] raid in Irish history occurred in AD [[795 in Ireland|795]] when Vikings, possibly from [[Norway]]<ref name=\"Woolfp47\">[[#Woolf07|Woolf, Alex ''From Pictland to Alba'', p. 47.]] Woolf \"constructs a plausible narrative\" based on an entry in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' where these early raiders can be identified as originating on the west-coast of Norway.</ref> looted the island of [[Lambay Island|Lambay]].<ref group=\"note\">[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, ''The Vikings & Ireland'', p. 9.]] The annals name the site of this attack as ''Rechru'', a name that could mean either modern Lambay Island or [[Rathlin Island|Rathlin]].</ref> This was followed by a raid on the coast of [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] in 798, and raids on the coast of [[Connacht]] in 807.<ref>[[#ByrneRIAxvi|Byrne, F.J.

In 841, however, Feidlimid was routed in battle by Niall in Leinster. His successors in the south would not be able to challenge the north again to this extent until some 150 years later.\n\n===Intensified raiding and the first Viking settlements in Ireland===\n{{See also|Early Scandinavian Dublin#The first Norse settlements in Dublin}}\nThe Viking raids on Ireland resumed in 821, and intensified during the following decades. The Vikings were beginning to establish fortified encampments, ''[[longports]]'', along the Irish coast and overwintering in Ireland instead of retreating to [[Scandinavia]] or [[Great Britain|British]] bases. The first known longports were at ''Linn D\u00faachaill'' ([[Annagassan]]) and ''Duiblinn'' (on the [[River Liffey]], at or near present [[Dublin]]).<ref>[[#OCor2001|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings in Ireland\"]], p. 19.</ref><ref group=\"note\">The first report of Vikings spending the winter in Ireland is from [[Lough Neagh]] 840\u201341, the first overwintered in Dublin 841\u201342.</ref> They were also moving further inland to attack, often using rivers such as the Shannon, and then retreating to their coastal bases. The raiding parties also increased in size, becoming regular armies\u2014in 837 the annals report a fleet of sixty [[longship]]s on the Liffey, carrying 1,500 men, and another one of a similar size sailing up the river Boyne, making their way into the inland territories and launching attacks on the lands of Brega in the south of County Meath.<ref>[[#AU|AU 873.3]], [[#OCor2001|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings in Ireland\"]], p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"ancient.eu\">https://www.ancient.eu/article/1162/the-vikings-in-ireland/</ref> In general, from 837 onward larger Viking forces hit larger targets \u2013 such as the greater monastic towns of Armagh, Glendalough, Kildare, Slane, Clonard, Clonmacnoise, and Lismore \u2013 while smaller targets such as local churches with less material to be plundered may have escaped the Vikings' attention.<ref name=\"ancient.eu\"/>\n\n[[File:Vidfamne-01.jpg|thumb|Modern replica of a Viking [[Knarr]].]]\nOne of the first named Viking leaders was [[Thorgest]] (in Latin ''Turgesius''). The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] connect him with attacks on [[Connacht]], [[Mide]] and the church at [[Clonmacnoise]] in 844.<ref>[[#AFM|AFM 843.13]]</ref> He was captured and drowned in [[Lough Owel]] by [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Ma\u00edl Ruanaid]], [[Kings of Mide|King of Mide]].<ref>[[#AU|AU 845.8]]</ref> However the existence of [[Thorgest]] is uncertain as he was recorded in books written over 200 years after his death in a period of strong anti-Viking sentiment. He was often depicted as a villain and his wife was said to be a witch that would perform pagan rituals on altars. It is highly likely that this was war propaganda as we have very little evidence of his existence from his own period, and it is unlikely those close to him would record this themselves.\n\nIn [[848 in Ireland|848]] a Norse army was defeated at Sciath Nechtain by [[\u00d3lchobar mac Cin\u00e1eda]] of Munster and [[Lorc\u00e1n mac Cellaig]] of Leinster. For the first time the leader of the Vikings is described as royalty from [[Lochlann]].<ref>[[#AU|AU 848.5]]</ref> M\u00e1el Sechnaill, now High King, defeated another army at ''Forrach'' the same year.<ref>[[#AU|AU 848.4]]</ref> These victories form the background of an embassy sent to the Frankish emperor [[Charles the Bald]], reported in the [[Annales Bertiniani]].<ref>[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Vikings & Ireland\"]], p. 16.</ref>\n\nIn 853 [[Olaf the White|Olaf]], identified as a \"son of the king of Lochlann\",<ref>[[#AU|AU 853.2]], \"Amhlaim m. righ Laithlinde...\"</ref> came to Ireland. ''Lochlann'' has been understood as (a district of) present [[Norway]]; it is now considered more plausible that it refers to a Scandinavian colony in the [[Hebrides|Western Isles]] of Scotland.<ref>[[#Hadley09|Hadley, Viking Raids and Conquest]], p. 201.</ref><ref group=\"note\">For a longer discussion on the location on Lochlann, see [[#OCor98|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"The Vikings in Scotland and Ireland in the Ninth Century\"]]</ref> Olaf assumed leadership of the Vikings in Ireland, probably in some way shared with his kinsman [[Ivar the Boneless|Ivar]], first mentioned in the Irish Annals in 857. Olaf and Ivar remained active in Ireland and around the [[Irish Sea]] for the next two decades. The descendants of Ivar, the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]], would be an important political factor for the next two centuries.\n\n===Shifting alliances and struggle for power===\nA significant new trait from the middle of the 9th century was that the Norse now also entered alliances with various Irish rulers. [[Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge]] had become king of Osraige in 842. Cerball had defeated Viking raiders in 846 and 847, but from 858 he is allied with Olaf and Ivar against M\u00e1el Sechnaill, campaigning in Leinster and Munster, and in 859 also raiding M\u00e1el Sechnaill's heartlands in Mide, though Cerball had to submit to M\u00e1el Sechnaill later the same year. These alliances were by no means permanent. In 860 Cerball was allied ''with'' M\u00e1el Sechnaill in a campaign against [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, while Olaf and Ivar has allied themselves with \u00c1ed. In 870, however, Cerball and \u00c1ed appeared as allies in Leinster.\n\nM\u00e1el Sechnaill had more success as high king than his predecessors Niall Caille and Conchobar Donnchada (Duncan) in dealing with the south, and forced Munster into submission in 858 and as noted above, Osraige in 859. He also asserted control over Ulaid, Leinster and Connacht, and was in his obituary in the Annals of Ulster described as ''ri h-Erenn uile'', king of all Ireland. The last years of his reign he had however experienced serious opposition from his U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kinsmen of Ailech and Brega, allied with the Norse of Dublin. [[Francis John Byrne|Byrne]] notes: \"M\u00e1el Sechnaill's unprecedented success in achieving the high-kingship of all Ireland was marred by the chronic complaint of Irish politics: having united the Ulaid, Munster, Osraige, Connacht and Leinster, he was attacked at the end of his reign by a combination of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kings.\"<ref>[[#ByrneRIAxvi|Byrne, \"The Viking Age\"]], p. 617.</ref>\n\n\u00c1ed Findliath was king of Ailech and the leading king within the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. After the death of M\u00e1el Sechnaill he is counted in the regal lists as high king, following the established scheme where this alternated between Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain in the north and Clann Cholm\u00e1in of Mide. His kingship was disputed though, and he did not come close to being an actual king over Ireland. He could count some successes against the Norse, however, most notably burning all the Norse longports in the north in 866.<ref>[[#AU|AU 866.8]]</ref> \u00c1ed seems to have used the opportunity while Olaf was involved in warfare in [[Pictland]], presumably bringing a large contingent of the Norse forces in Ireland with him. The Vikings never managed to establish permanent settlements in the north. [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] observes: \"Ironically, [\u00c1ed Findliath's] success may have held back the economic development of the north and ultimately prevented the growth of port towns like those on the east and south coasts, on which the Leinster and Munster kings subsequently depended for much of their wealth.\"<ref>[[#OCorV&I|\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Vikings & Ireland\"]], p. 20.</ref>\n\nThe last report of Olaf is when he and Ivar returned to Dublin in 871 from [[Alba]].<ref>[[#AU|AU 871.2]]</ref> Ivar died in 873.

Flandacain co feraibh Bregh  & o Cerball m. Muiricain co Laignibh...\", that is \"longport\", not \"fortress\".</ref>\n\nA group of Vikings led by Hingamund who were forced out of Ireland were given permission by the Saxons to settle in [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], in the north west of England. \"The Three Fragments\" refers to a distinct group of settlers living among these Vikings as \"Irishmen\": \"Then the King, who was on the point of death, and the Queen sent messengers to the Irishmen who were among the pagans, for there were many Irish among the pagans, to say to the Irishmen, life and health to you from the King of the Saxons, who is in disease, and from his Queen, who has all authority over the Saxons, and they are certain that you are true and trusty friends to them. Therefore you should take their side; for they did not bestow any greater honour to a Saxon warror or cleric than to each warrior and cleric who came to them from Ireland, because this inimical race of pagans is equally hostile to you also.\" Further evidence of an Irish presence in Wirral comes from the name of the village of [[Irby, Merseyside|Irby]] in Wirral, which means \"farmstead of the Irishmen\", and [[St Bridget's Church, West Kirby]] which is known to have been founded by \"Christian Vikings from Ireland\".<ref>[http://saintpatrickscrossliverpool.webs.com/ Irish Migration to Merseyside]</ref><ref>[http://www.stbridgetschurch.org.uk/ St Bridget's Church West Kirby]</ref>\n\n=== Failed Conquest ===\nThe Vikings were able to exploit internal divisions in order to invade England and France. As Ireland was one of the most politically fractured countries at the time, it was a prime target for Viking conquest. Furthermore, Irish Kings often made alliances with foreign invaders in an attempt to weaken their domestic rivals. The Vikings were able to defeat the centralized Kingdoms of Europe, since the small ruling class was easily removed. However, Ireland was composed of more than 150 different Kingdoms ruling over small territories. This decentralized system of governance made it almost impossible to gain control of a territory, since defeated Kings were easily replaced.\n\n===Impact on cultural activity and formation of Irish scholarly diaspora===\nHistorians debate the consequences that the initial phases of Viking settlement had on scholarship and literary output.<ref>[[#FlechnerMeeder2016Conclusion|Flechner and Meeder (2016), ''The Irish in Early Medieval Europe'']], pp. 231\u201341.</ref> Scholarly activity, for which the Irish are famous in the early Medieval period, consisted of the writing of poetry, the production of Christian devotional texts, the development of the science of [[computus]], and the compilation of elaborate law tracts.<ref>[[#Johnston2013|Johnston (2013), ''Literacy and Identity in Early Medieval Ireland'']], pp. 27\u201358.</ref> Patronage for scholars and scholarship came largely from Irish kings who regarded the presence of court scholars as part and parcel of the trappings of kingship, but also as a means of bolstering their own image through praise poetry that such scholars composed and performed. With the advent of the Vikings, patronage ties have been argued to have been loosened, thereby affecting directly the livelihood of Irish scholars. In addition, some kings would have turned their attention to more pressing (but also more profitable) pursuits, such as engaging in warfare or alliances with Vikings or other Irish kings, as well as tapping the economic benefits that Viking trade would have brought. While this was happening in Ireland, we observe a more pronounced presence of Irish scholars in Frankish Europe, and especially in circles associated with the [[Carolingian]] court. Commonly known as [[Irish Diaspora|''peregrini'']], Irish scholars such as [[John Scottus Eriugena]] and [[Sedulius Scottus]] became among the most prominent and influential in ninth-century continental Europe, studying and teaching a range of subjects, from theology to political philosophy. It is tempting to link their presence on the Continent as well as the presence of scores of other Irish learned people with the impact of the Vikings on Ireland, which may have driven such people to seek employment elsewhere. If one accepts this version of events, then the Vikings can be said to have inadvertently been one of the principal catalysts for the spread of Irish culture abroad and the subsequent foundation of Irish centres on the Continent which remained influential for centuries to come.<ref>[[#FlechnerMeeder2016Conclusion|Flechner and Meeder (2016), ''The Irish in Early Medieval Europe'']], pp. 179\u201394, 231\u201341.</ref>\n\n==Second Viking age (914\u2013980)==\n{{see also|Norse-Gaels}}\n{{Campaignbox Viking wars in Ireland|state=open}}\nAfter having been forced to leave Dublin in 902, the descendants of Ivar, now described generically in the annals as the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]],<ref group=\"note\">Grandsons or great grandsons of Ivar, no other patronym was given for these, which makes it difficult trace their lineage.

In 914 a new Viking fleet appeared in [[Waterford Harbour]], and soon the U\u00ed \u00cdmair followed, again taking control over Viking activities in Ireland. [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|Ragnall]] arrived with a fleet in Waterford, while [[Sihtric C\u00e1ech|Sitric]] landed at ''Cenn Fuait'' (possibly near [[Leixlip]]) in Leinster. [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] had followed Flann Sinna as U\u00ed N\u00e9ill overking in 916, and he marched into Munster against Ragnall, but no decisive engagement followed. The men of Leinster under [[Augaire mac Ailella]] attacked Sithric but suffered a heavy defeat in the [[Battle of Confey]] or ''Cenn Fuait'' (917). This victory allowed Sithric to re-establish Norse control over Dublin.

Apart from his victories over the Norse, Muirchertach led campaigns forcing other provincial kingdoms into submission, most notably taking the king of Munster [[Cellach\u00e1n Caisil]] captive in 941.

He was driven out by [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], and returned to Dublin half a year later. The Vikings of Limerick had taken Dublin in his absence. Gofraid retook the city, but the struggle between Limerick continued well after Gofraid's death in 934. He was succeeded by his son, [[Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid (died 941)|Amla\u00edb]], who inflicted a decisive defeat on Limerick in 937. The same year Amla\u00edb went to Northumbria and allied himself with [[Constantine II of Scotland]] and [[Owen I of Strathclyde]]. Athelstan defeated this coalition at [[Battle of Brunanburh|Brunanburh]] (937), but after Athelstan's death in 939 Amla\u00edb became king of York. He was joined by a kinsman with the same name, [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n|Amla\u00edb]] son of Sihtric, known as ''Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n''.\n\n[[Congalach mac M\u00e1el Mithig]], known as ''Cnogba'', succeeded (Duncan) Donnchad Donn as U\u00ed N\u00e9ill overking in 944 (Muirchertag, who otherwise might have been the obvious successor, had been killed in 943). Congalach was king of Brega and a member of [[S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine]], and the first of this dynasty called \"High King\" since [[Cin\u00e1ed mac \u00cdrgalaig]] in the early 8th century. In 944 he sacked Dublin, now ruled by [[Bl\u00e1caire mac Gofrith]]. When Amla\u00edb Cuaran returned to Ireland the next year, he became ruler of Dublin and acted as an ally of Congalach in the struggle against [[Ruaidr\u00ed ua Canann\u00e1in]], a rival U\u00ed N\u00e9ill claimant for High Kingship from [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]]. This alliance did not last long after Ruaidr\u00ed's death in 950, however, and Congalach was killed in 956 in a battle against an alliance of Dublin and Leinster. He was succeeded by [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]], and in the following decades alliances shifted constantly between the different branches of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, Leinster and Dublin.\n\nIn 980 [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] succeeded Domnall, and the same year he defeated the forces of Dublin at the [[Battle of Tara (Ireland)|battle of Tara]]. Following this victory M\u00e1el Sechnaill forced Dublin into submission, and his half-brother, Amla\u00edbs son [[Gl\u00faniairn]], became ruler in Dublin.\n\n==M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill and Brian Boru (980\u20131022)==\n[[File:Brian Boru, King of Munster.jpg|thumb|18th-century [[engraving]] of [[Brian Boru]].]]\nIn Munster, the influence of the [[Dal gCais]] had grown under [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in]], and his son [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]] was the first non-[[E\u00f3ganachta]] ruler to be named by the annals as king of Cashel (i.e. king of Munster) in historical times.<ref name=\"ODNBBrian\">[[#ODNBBrian|Duffy, ''Brian B\u00f3ruma'']]</ref> He was killed in 976, and succeeded by his brother [[Brian Boru|Brian]], later famously known as ''Brian Boru''.\n\nBrian quickly established himself as the most powerful ruler in Munster, defeating the Norse of Limerick in 977 and the E\u00f3ganachta the following year. Having gained control over Munster, he tried to extend his authority by raiding Osraige in 982 and 983, and also, according to the [[annals of Innisfallen]], entering an alliance with the Norse of [[Waterford]], with the intention of attacking Dublin.<ref name=\"ODNBBrian\"/> There was such an attack, but Brian does not seem to have been involved \u2013 instead it was [[Domnall Claen]] of Leinster who was allied with [[Ivar of Waterford]], and they were defeated by Gl\u00faniairn and M\u00e1el Sechnaill.\n\nM\u00e1el Sechnaill obviously perceived Brian as a threat, and as early as 982 raided Munster and the territory of the Dal gCais. The next two decades saw more or less constant warfare between them, mostly with Leinster as their battleground. Even if Brian never defeated M\u00e1el Sechnaill in battle, Brian's and Munster's influence was growing at the expense of M\u00e1el Sechnaill and the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. In 997 M\u00e1el Sechnaill was forced to acknowledge Brian's authority over the south of Ireland, and they formally divided Ireland according to the traditional scheme of [[Leath Cuinn|Leath Cuinn and Leath Moga]]. In the years that followed, the two of them acted as allies in accordance with this agreement. In 999 Brian quelled a revolt against him by the men of Leinster and Dublin at the [[battle of Glen Mama]], and only restored [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]] as ruler of Dublin after he had formally submitted to Brian by handing over hostages.<ref name=\"ODNBBrian\"/>\n\nIn 1000, Brian turned against M\u00e1el Sechnaill, and by 1002 he had forced M\u00e1el Sechnaill to submit to him, and now claimed kingship over the whole of Ireland. In the following decade, there were several campaigns in the north to force the Ulaid and the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill into submission as well. Even if faced with multiple rebellions, both in the north and in Leinster, by 1011 he had received submission from every major regional king in Ireland, and thus earned the recognition by historians as the first real ''king of Ireland''.<ref name=\"Jaski05Brian\">[[#Jaski05Brian|Jaski, Brian Boru]]</ref> During his visit to Armagh in 1005, he had his secretary add a note to the [[Book of Armagh]] where he is proclaimed as ''Imperator Scottorum'' (emperor of the Irish). According to Bart Jaski, \"This can be regarded as a claim that he ruled both the Irish and the Norse in Ireland, and may even imply suzerainty over the Gaels of Scotland\".<ref name=\"Jaski05Brian\"/> In his obituary in the Annals of Ulster he is styled as \"over-king of the Irish of Ireland, and of the foreigners and of the Britons, the Augustus of the whole of north-west Europe\".<ref>[[#AU|AU 1014.2]], \"ardr\u00ed Gaidhel Erenn & Gall & Bretan, August iartair tuaiscirt Eorpa uile\"</ref>\n\nIn 1012, [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]] revolted against Brian, and the following year [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada|M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda]] of Leinster and Sigtrygg of Dublin did too. The latter led to the famous [[battle of Clontarf]], where Brian was killed, even if his army was victorious over M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda, Sigtrygg and their allies. [[Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Earl of Orkney]] as well as forces from [[Isle of Man|Man]] participated on the Dublin/ Leinster side, and this may, in conjunction with the propagandistic account of the battle given in the Cogad, have created the still popular myth that what took place at Clontarf [[Good Friday]] 1014 was a decisive battle where the Irish defeated Viking invaders and were liberated from oppression (Duncan) [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] was one of the first to publicly debunk this national myth, in his groundbreaking ''Ireland before the Normans'' from 1972:\n{{quote|The battle of Clontarf was not a struggle between the Irish and the Norse for the sovereignty of Ireland; neither was it a great national victory which broke the power of the Norse forever (long before Clontarf the Norse had become a minor political force in Irish affairs). In fact Clontarf was part of the internal struggle for sovereignty and was essentially the revolt of the Leinstermen against the dominance of Brian, a revolt in which their Norse allies played an important but secondary role.|Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in<ref group=\"note\">Quoted from [[#Duffy09|Duffy, \"Ireland, c. 1000 \u2013 c. 1100\"]], p. 288.

Though Donnchad (Duncan) eventually was victorious, the descendants of Brian would not be able to make a real claim to kingship over Ireland again until [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]]. In Leinster, the defeat at Clontarf and death of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda seriously weakened the [[U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge]], and opened the way for a new [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] dominance in the region.

When he wrote in 1056 he evidently did not know any high king of Ireland, and instead lists a number of kings of the day: (Duncan) Conchobar, \u00c1ed, Garbith, Diarmait, Donnchad (Duncan) and two Nialls. According to Byrne, these are Conchobar Ua Ma\u00edl Schechnaill of Mide, [[\u00c1ed in Gai Bernaig|\u00c1ed Ua Conchobair]] of Connacht, Garb\u00edth Ua Cathassaig of Brega, [[Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3]] of Leinster, Donnchad (Duncan) Mac Briain of Munster, Niall mac M\u00e1el Sechnaill of Ailech and [[Niall mac Eochada]] of Ulaid.<ref name=Byrnep866/>\n\nThe term ''r\u00ed \u00c9renn co fressarba'' (\"High kings with opposition\") was used from the 12th century.

Niall and Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3 became allies, and effectively controlled the whole east coast of Ireland. This alliance helped to make it possible for Diarmait to take direct control of Dublin in 1052. Unlike M\u00e1el Sechnaill in 980 or Brian in 999, he wasn't content with just looting the city and expelling the Hiberno-Norse ruler ([[Echmarcach mac Ragnaill]]); in an unprecedented move he assumed the kingship \"of the foreigners\" (''r\u00edge Gall'') himself.<ref>[[#Duffy92|Duffy, Irishmen and Islesmen]], p. 94.</ref>\n{{expand section|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Reform of the Irish Church==\n[[File:St. Malachy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Malachy]] was an influential 12th-century reformist ecclesiastic in Ireland.]]\n{{See also|Synod of Rathbreasail|Synod of Kells-Mellifont}}\nThere were major reforms in the Irish church during the 12th century. These reforms have been generally interpreted as a reaction to previous secularisation, but could also be seen as a continuous development.<ref>[[#HughesRIAxvii|Hughes, The Irish Church, 800 \u2013 c. 1050]], p. 655, note 70.</ref> The reforms had consequences for, and were influenced by, relations within the church as well as secular politics.\n\nBefore the 11th century the church in Ireland was [[monastic]], with bishops residing at monasteries and without a permanent [[diocese|diocesan]] structure. The circumstances surrounding the foundation of the diocese of Dublin early in the century are obscure, but at some point during the reign of Sithric Silkbeard [[Donat, Bishop of Dublin|D\u00fan\u00e1n]] became [[Bishop of Dublin]], thus establishing the first proper diocese in Ireland. His successor [[Gilla P\u00e1traic]] was consecrated by [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and on that occasion Lanfranc sent letters to Toirdelbach Ua Briain and [[Gofraid mac Amlaib mac Ragnaill|Gofraid]] urging reforms, in particular regarding the consecration of bishops and the abolition of [[simony]]. There is no evidence of Canterbury claiming primacy over the church in Ireland prior to this, and neither Lanfranc nor [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] ever made direct primatial claims for Canterbury in relation to the Irish church.<ref>[[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan]], p. 913.</ref>\n\nToirdelbach appears to have responded favourably to this, and convened a synod in Dublin in 1080<ref>[[#Holland05reform|Holland, Church reforms]]</ref> \u2013 the outcome of this synod is not known. Toirdelbach may have seen cooperation with Canterbury as a way to reduce the influence from Armagh, traditionally dominated by Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain, within the church in Ireland. Gilla P\u00e1traic's successors [[Donngus Ua hAingliu]] and [[Samuel Ua h\u00c1ingliu]] were also consecrated in Canterbury, and so was the first bishop of Waterford, [[M\u00e1el \u00cdsu Ua hAinmire]] in 1096. The written request for M\u00e1el \u00cdsu's consecration, as preserved in [[Eadmer]]'s ''Historia Novorum'', is subscribed by bishops from Munster, Mide, Dublin and Leinster.<ref>[[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan]], pp. 911\u201312</ref> [[Gilla Espaic]], the first bishop of Limerick, was however not consecrated in Canterbury, but probably by [[Ceallach of Armagh|Cellach]] of Armagh.<ref group=\"note\">Gilla received a letter from Anselm congratulating him on his elevation to the see of Limerick, and there was no suggestion that Anselm felt Canterbury had been slighted or ought to have been involved. [[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan, p. 915.]]</ref>\n\nThe first of the four main synods associated with the church reforms of the 12th century took place in Cashel in 1101, at the instigation of Muirchertach Ua Briain. How many who actually attended this synod is not known, but some of its decrees have been preserved. There is a decree on simony, on prohibition for laymen to become ''airchinnig'' (heads of ecclesiastical establishments) and finally a decree that defines what relationships are considered to be incestuous. None of these decrees are radical, but they are generally interpreted to be in line with the [[Gregorian reform]].<ref>[[#Holland05Cashel1|Holland, Cashel, synod of I (1101)]]</ref>\n\nThe second synod was the [[Synod of Rathbreasail]]. This synod, presided by Gilla Espaic<ref>[[#Holland05Gille|Holland, Gille (Gilbert) of Limerick]]</ref> as [[papal legate]] and attended by fifty bishops, three hundred priests and over three thousand laymen, marked the transition of the Irish church from a monastic to a diocesan and parish-based church. It established two provinces, with archbishoprics at Armagh and Cashel, and prominence given to Armagh, making Cellach the primate of the church in Ireland. Each province consisted of twelve territorial dioceses. The see of Dublin was not included, as this was under primacy from Canterbury,<ref group=\"note\">The see of Waterford however, where the incumbent bishop M\u00e1el \u00cdsu Ua hAinmire also had been consecrated in, and taken vows of obedience to, Canterbury, was moved to Lismore, and M\u00e1el \u00cdsu chosen as the first archbishop of Cashel.</ref> but a place was left open for it, in the sense that only eleven dioceses were declared under Cashel.\n\nGilla, Cellach and Cellach's successor M\u00e1el M\u00e1ed\u00f3c Ua Morgair, better known as [[St. Malachy]], drove the reform process onwards. Malachy, in close cooperation with (Duncan) [[Donnchad Ua Cerbaill]], king of Fernmag/Airgialla, established the first Irish [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] house at [[Mellifont]] in 1142, and also facilitated the first [[Augustinian]] community of the [[Arrouaise|Arrouaisian]] observance. Malachy used these as agencies of monastic reform within the Irish church.<ref>[[#FlanaganRIAxxvi|Flanagan]], p. 923.</ref> Malachy resigned as archbishop of Armagh in 1136, but was appointed native papal legate to Ireland by [[Pope Innocent II|Innocent II]] in 1139.\n\n[[File:Dioceses of Medieval Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Maps of dioceses in Ireland as defined by the synod of Kells. From ''Historical Atlas'' by [[William Robert Shepherd|William R. Shepherd]].]]\nNo formal attempts on getting papal approval for the structure chosen at Rathbreasail are known before Malachy sought [[pallium|pallia]] for the two incumbent archbishops at Cashel and Armagh during his trip to the Continent in 1139/40. This first bid was unsuccessful, but Malachy was told to reapply after he had gained the agreement of all Ireland.<ref>[[#Holland05reform|Holland, Church reform]]</ref> Before undertaking his second trip to the Continent in 1148, Malachy convened a synod at [[St Patrick's Island]]. The main challenge must have been to reach an accommodation with Dublin, and [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]], presently the most powerful king in Ireland, was eager to increase Connacht influence on the church. The solution reached was to extend the number of metropolitan sees from two to four, with [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Tuam]] and Dublin included alongside Cashel and Armagh. Malachy died on his way to meet the pope, but the message was transmitted by other means and papal approval was granted. [[Pope Eugene III]] appointed cardinal [[Giovanni Paparoni|John Paparo]] as papal legate, and sent him to Ireland with pallia for the four archbishops.\n\nCardinal Paparo's first attempt to reach Ireland was stalled when king [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] refused him safe conduct through England unless he pledged himself to do nothing in Ireland that would injure England's interests there. This was not acceptable for Paparo, who returned to Rome. It seems likely that this was an attempt by Stephen to prevent Paparo from bringing papal confirmation for an arrangement in Ireland that would finally extinguish Canterbury's claims in Ireland.<ref>[[#Holland05Kells|Holland, Synod of Kells]], p. 247.</ref> In 1151 he returned and this time reached Ireland, his journey being facilitated by [[David I of Scotland]]. The [[Synod of Kells-Mellifont]] was convened in 1152, with Paparo presiding as papal legate. The decrees from the synod are no longer extant, but some information is preserved through the [[Annals of the Four Masters]]<ref>[[#AFM|AFM 1152.4]]</ref> and [[Geoffrey Keating]]'s ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn''.
