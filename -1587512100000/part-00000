After a failed attempt at sex with his girlfriend Tracy ([[Jessy Schram]]), she gives Erik a free pass to go to the [[University of Michigan]], where his cousin Dwight ([[Steve Talley]]) attends, to lose his virginity. In the process, Erik's loyalty is put to the test.\n\n''[[American Pie Presents: Beta House]]'' (2007) continues a year after ''The Naked Mile''. Erik has now graduated from high school, has lost his girlfriend to her previous boyfriend, and is starting college.

The films featured mostly new characters. Aside from the raunchy humor, the common elements among the ''American Pie Presents'' films are the continued presence of Jim's Dad and members of the Stifler clan. Other than Jim's Dad, the only other returning characters are Matt Stifler, who takes center stage for the first spin-off, albeit played by a new actor, and Chuck Sherman, who is the guidance counselor for East Great Falls High School in the first spin-off.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"4\" | Box office gross\n! colspan=\"2\" | Box office ranking\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Budget <br />(million)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{Abbr|Ref|Reference}}\n|- \n!

''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', the first film in the series, was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1999. The film became a worldwide [[Popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon and gained a cult following amongst young people. Following ''American Pie'', the second and third films in the series ''[[American Pie 2]]'' (2001) and ''[[American Wedding]]'' (2003)--were released; the fourth, ''[[American Reunion]]'', was released in 2012. A spin-off film series entitled ''[[American Pie Presents (film series)|American Pie Presents]]'' consists of four direct-to-video films that were released from 2005 to 2009.\n\nThroughout the first film in the original series, Jim Levenstein ([[Jason Biggs]]) tries to develop a relationship with his school classmate Nadia ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]). Jim and his best friends Kevin Myers ([[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]), Paul Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]), and Chris Ostreicher ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]) make a pact to lose their virginity before their high school graduation. In the second film, the four friends host a summer party with Finch's [[frenemy]], [[Steve Stifler]] ([[Seann William Scott]]), and Jim becomes interested in his friend, Michelle Flaherty ([[Alyson Hannigan]]). In the third film, Jim and Michelle plan to marry, although the forced invitation of Stifler could ruin everything. In the fourth film, the gang gets back together in anticipation of their thirteenth high school reunion. The spin-off series revolves around relatives of Stifler, including his brother Matt ([[Tad Hilgenbrink]]); his cousins Erik ([[John White (actor)|John White]]), Dwight ([[Steve Talley]]), Scott (John Patrick Jordan); and their respective friends.\n\nThe original series, produced on a total budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]145 million, has grossed over 800 million worldwide. The spin-off films were released [[direct-to-video]].

While there, he realizes he must change his arrogant ways in order to win over Elyse.\n\n''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile]]'' (2006) follows Erik Stifler ([[John White (actor)|John White]]), the only Stifler to possibly graduate from high school a virgin. After a failed attempt at sex with his girlfriend Tracy ([[Jessy Schram]]), she gives Erik a free pass to go to the [[University of Michigan]], where his cousin Dwight ([[Steve Talley]]) attends, to lose his virginity. In the process, Erik's loyalty is put to the test.\n\n''[[American Pie Presents: Beta House]]'' (2007) continues a year after ''The Naked Mile''. Erik has now graduated from high school, has lost his girlfriend to her previous boyfriend, and is starting college. He must complete a series of tasks before he can join Dwight's fraternity and also begins a new relationship with Ashley Thomas ([[Meghan Heffern]]), a girl he met in the co-ed bathrooms in their dorm.\n\n''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love]]'' (2009) takes place ten years after ''American Pie''. Set in East Great Falls, a fire in the school's library results in the destruction of the Book of Love (the \"Bible\" from the first film). With the help of the book's creator, Mr. Levenstein, the people who started the fire set out to restore the book and lose their virginity.\n\nMore than six years after the release of the original ''American Pie'', the franchise continued with a [[direct-to-video]] spin-off ''Presents'' series; consisting of ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp|Band Camp]]'', released on December 26, 2005,<ref name=\"amzn-band\">{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/American-Pie-Band-Unrated-Widescreen/dp/B000BT970Y |title= American Pie - Band Camp (Unrated Widescreen Edition)|publisher=Amazon.com |date= |access-date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|The Naked Mile]]'', released on December 12, 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Pie-Naked-Unrated-Widescreen/dp/B000JJSJPU |title=American Pie - The Naked Mile (Unrated Widescreen Edition)|publisher=Amazon.com |date= |access-date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> ''[[American Pie Presents: Beta House|Beta House]]'', released on December 26, 2007,<ref name=\"amzn-beta\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Pie-Presents-Beta-House/dp/B000WC39KO |title=American Pie Presents: Beta House|publisher=Amazon.com |date= |access-date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> and ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love|The Book of Love]]'', released on December 22, 2009.<ref name=\"amzn-love\">{{cite web |title= American Pie Presents: The Book of Love |url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Pie-Presents-Book-Love/dp/B002UJIY0C |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |access-date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> All four spin-offs center around relatives of Steve Stifler, who include his brother Matt and his cousins Erik, Dwight, and Scott Stifler.<ref name=\"american pie 4\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=2005|medium=[[DVD]] }}</ref><ref name=\"american pie 5\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=2006|medium=[[DVD]] }}</ref><ref name=\"american pie 6\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie Presents: Beta House]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=2007|medium=[[DVD]] }}</ref><ref name=\"american pie 7\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=2009|medium=[[DVD]] }}</ref>\n\nSeveral films set in the ''American Pie'' continuity were released. The films featured mostly new characters. Aside from the raunchy humor, the common elements among the ''American Pie Presents'' films are the continued presence of Jim's Dad and members of the Stifler clan. Other than Jim's Dad, the only other returning characters are Matt Stifler, who takes center stage for the first spin-off, albeit played by a new actor, and Chuck Sherman, who is the guidance counselor for East Great Falls High School in the first spin-off.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Release date\n! colspan=\"4\" | Box office gross\n! colspan=\"2\" | Box office ranking\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Budget <br />(million)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{Abbr|Ref|Reference}}\n|- \n!

The 3rd Massachusetts was stationed in [[New Bern, North Carolina]], participated in several expeditions and saw minor combat including the [[Battle of Goldsboro Bridge]] and the [[Siege of Little Washington]].{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1246}}\n\n==Earlier units==\nOther units dating back to the 18th century were given the designation 3rd Regiment Massachusetts Militia. Such regiments were organized and disbanded several times. These included a regiment that was organized in 1775, served during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and fought at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] among other engagements.{{sfnp|Luzader|2014|p=372}} During the reorganization of the Massachusetts militia in 1840, the 3rd Massachusetts was designated as part of the Second Brigade of the First Division of the Volunteer Corps of Massachusetts Militia.{{sfnp|Stone|1851|p=372}}\n\nIn 1858, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] David W. Wardrop of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] was appointed to command the 3rd Massachusetts. Wardrop had trained with the Massachusetts militia for much of his life, first with the Boston Fusiliers and later with the City Guards of New Bedford. Although not a career soldier, he was respected for his knowledge of military tactics.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=12}} Wardrop commanded the unit during its first term of service in the field during the Civil War.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=136}}\n\n==90 days term==\n[[File:Burning of USS Merrimack, 1861.png|thumb|right|The USS Merrimack burning during the destruction of the Norfolk Navy Yard by Union troops, including the 3rd Massachusetts]]The 3rd Massachusetts was organized for active service on April 15, 1861 in response to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] call for 75,000 troops to put down the insurrection in the southern states. Despite the various companies being dispersed over a large area of southeastern Massachusetts, Col. Wardrop managed to get word to the [[Captain (United States O-3)|captains]] under his command during the night of April 15\u201316.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=10}} The 3rd Massachusetts was among the first Massachusetts regiments to report for service in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] on April 16.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=136}} The unit was therefore one of several Massachusetts regiments which became known as the \"Minutemen of '61,\" in reference to the [[Minutemen]] who turned out in April 1775 during the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=3}}\n\nThe 3rd Massachusetts reported to Boston with an incomplete roster of seven out of ten companies. Three newly recruited companies were therefore added to the unit to fill out their ranks. These three new companies, primarily from the Boston area, had enlisted for three years as opposed to the 90 day service for which the bulk of the regiment had enlisted. After the 3rd Massachusetts was mustered out in July 1861, the new companies were eventually transferred to the [[29th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|29th Massachusetts]] to serve out the remainder of their term.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=137}}\n\nThe regiment arrived via ship at Fortress Monroe, a Union foothold on the Virginia coast, in the morning of April 20, 1861. That afternoon, they were loaded on board the [[USS Pawnee (1859)|USS ''Pawnee'']] and taken to the Gosport Navy Yard across [[Hampton Roads]] at Norfolk. The Navy yard, its vessels, and valuable stores were expected to fall into [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hands. Therefore, the 3rd Massachusetts was given orders to set fire to all buildings, vessels and stores. Col. Wardrop felt the strategic location could be defended and offered to deploy the 3rd Massachusetts to hold the position. This request was denied and details were ordered to go about firing the Navy yard. The 3rd Massachusetts returned aboard the ''Pawnee'' which towed the [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] to Fortress Monroe, saving the [[frigate]] from falling into enemy hands. In executing this assignment, the 3rd Massachusetts claimed that they were the first Union troops to make an incursion on territory held by the Confederacy.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=15}}\n\nDuring May and June 1861, the 3rd Massachusetts was garrisoned at Fortress Monroe and conducted occasional patrols beyond the fort. On July 1, the regiment was ordered to occupy the town of [[Hampton, Virginia]] just four miles from the fort. Confederate forces were massing nearby at [[Big Bethel]] and the post was considered a dangerous one due to the proximity of the enemy and the [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]] sentiments of the local population. One soldier of the 3rd Massachusetts was shot and beaten while at Hampton, though he survived.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=14}}\n\nOn July 16, the regiment marched to Fortess Monroe and boarded a steamship for Boston. They were mustered out at [[Camp Wightman]] on [[Long Island, Boston|Long Island]] in Boston harbor on July 22.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=17}}\n\n==9 months term==\n[[File:Richmond, Silas P.jpg|thumb|Col. Silas P. Richmond, commanding officer of the 3rd Massachusetts during its second enlistment]]The regiment was again activated for federal service following Lincoln's call in August 1862 for 300,000 troops to serve for nine months. The 3rd Massachusetts reported to [[Camp Joe Hooker]] in [[Lakeville, Massachusetts]] and was mustered in on September 23, 1862. The regiment at this time was composed of newly recruited companies and was virtually a different regiment, in terms of its roster, than the original 90 day incarnation. During this term, the regiment was commanded by Col. Silas P. Richmond who had trained in the Massachusetts militia for more than ten years and fought with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis.{{sfnp|Nason|1910|p=45}} The unit trained at Camp Joe Hooker for roughly a month, moved to Boston on October 22, 1862, and that day boarded two ships bound for [[Beaufort, South Carolina]]. From there they proceeded by rail to [[New Bern, North Carolina]] which served as the base of operations for the Union's [[Department of Virginia and North Carolina#Department of North Carolina|Department of North Carolina]] commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John G. Foster]].{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=136}}\n\nThe Union occupied several key positions along the North Carolina coast, however the interior was controlled by Confederate forces which frequently threatened or besieged Union strongholds. The 3rd Massachusetts took part in several patrols and expeditions aimed at disrupting Confederate supply lines in the interior and dislodging Confederate forces encroaching on Union positions.{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1246}} In November, Company I of the regiment was detached and shipped to [[Plymouth, North Carolina]] where they served garrison duty apart from the regiment for five months. Confederates attacked the Plymouth on December 10, 1862 and Company I suffered the first battle casualties of the 3rd Massachusetts\u2014two killed, several wounded and 14 prisoners.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=17}}\n\nThe most significant operation in which the 3rd Massachusetts was engaged was the Goldsboro Expedition in December 1862. Maj. Gen. Foster marched virtually all of his available forces from New Bern, numbering approximately 12,000, to disrupt the Confederate supply line to Virginia along the [[Wilmington and Weldon Railroad]] by destroying the Goldsboro Bridge (roughly 60 miles from New Bern).{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=26}} This expedition was executed in coordination with Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside|Ambrose Burnside's]] assault on [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. During this expedition, the regiment took part in the Battles of [[Battle of Kinston|Kinston]], [[Battle of White Hall|White Hall]] and [[Battle of Goldsboro Bridge|Goldsboro Bridge]].{{sfnp|Dyer|1908|p=1246}} The 3rd Massachusetts was engaged in only minor skirmishing during this expedition. On December 17, Foster's force reached Goldsboro and destroyed the railroad bridge. The 3rd Massachusetts destroyed approximately three miles of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad outside of Goldsboro after which they were engaged with the enemy while part of a rear guard action.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=36}} The regiment reached New Bern on December 21 having suffered casualties of six wounded.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=38}}\n\nOn December 30, 1862, the regiment was assigned to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Charles Adam Heckman|Charles A. Heckman's]] brigade and prepared to march for an southward expedition to South Carolina. However, the weapons that the 3rd Massachusetts had been issued upon reaching North Carolina were of poor quality being antiquated Austrian muskets confiscated from a captured southern [[blockade runner]].{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=23}} The weapons were inspected and condemned and the 3rd Massachusetts was reassigned to Col. James Jourdan's brigade occupying the defenses of New Bern. The 3rd Massachusetts was stationed at [[DeGraffenried Park Historic District|Fort Totten]], guarding the land approaches to New Bern and remained with Col. Jourdan's brigade until the end of their service.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=140}}\n\nDuring their months serving garrison duty in the vicinity of New Bern, the 3rd Massachusetts was frequently employed in digging trenches and occasionally participated in brief expeditions and patrols. On March 6, 1863, the regiment marched on a five-day expedition with Brig. Gen. Henry Prince's division in [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones]] and [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow Counties]]. On April 7, the regiment left New Bern, were shipped across the [[Neuse River]] and joined a column commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Francis B. Spinola]]. This column marched swiftly in an attempt to relieve Union forces and break the [[Battle of Washington|Siege of Little Washington]]. Strong resistance from Confederate artillery, however, caused the column to turn back to New Bern. This rapid expedition of thirty miles and frequent skirmishing was remembered as the most exhausting mission in which the 3rd Massachusetts took part.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=42}}\n\nThe regiment left New Bern on June 11, 1863 and embarked for Boston. On reaching Boston, the men were [[furlough]]ed for several days to return home and then reported to Camp Hooker on June 22. The regiment was mustered out in Lakeville on June 26, 1863.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=140-141}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Massachusetts in the Civil War]]\n* [[List of Massachusetts Civil War units]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|title=Massachusetts in the War, 1861&ndash;1865 |last=Bowen |first=James L. |authorlink= |year=1889 |place=Springfield, Massachusetts |publisher=Clark W.

The 3rd Massachusetts destroyed approximately three miles of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad outside of Goldsboro after which they were engaged with the enemy while part of a rear guard action.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=36}} The regiment reached New Bern on December 21 having suffered casualties of six wounded.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=38}}\n\nOn December 30, 1862, the regiment was assigned to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Charles Adam Heckman|Charles A. Heckman's]] brigade and prepared to march for an southward expedition to South Carolina. However, the weapons that the 3rd Massachusetts had been issued upon reaching North Carolina were of poor quality being antiquated Austrian muskets confiscated from a captured southern [[blockade runner]].{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=23}} The weapons were inspected and condemned and the 3rd Massachusetts was reassigned to Col. James Jourdan's brigade occupying the defenses of New Bern. The 3rd Massachusetts was stationed at [[DeGraffenried Park Historic District|Fort Totten]], guarding the land approaches to New Bern and remained with Col. Jourdan's brigade until the end of their service.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=140}}\n\nDuring their months serving garrison duty in the vicinity of New Bern, the 3rd Massachusetts was frequently employed in digging trenches and occasionally participated in brief expeditions and patrols. On March 6, 1863, the regiment marched on a five-day expedition with Brig. Gen. Henry Prince's division in [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones]] and [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow Counties]]. On April 7, the regiment left New Bern, were shipped across the [[Neuse River]] and joined a column commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Francis B. Spinola]]. This column marched swiftly in an attempt to relieve Union forces and break the [[Battle of Washington|Siege of Little Washington]]. Strong resistance from Confederate artillery, however, caused the column to turn back to New Bern. This rapid expedition of thirty miles and frequent skirmishing was remembered as the most exhausting mission in which the 3rd Massachusetts took part.{{sfnp|Gammons|1906|p=42}}\n\nThe regiment left New Bern on June 11, 1863 and embarked for Boston. On reaching Boston, the men were [[furlough]]ed for several days to return home and then reported to Camp Hooker on June 22. The regiment was mustered out in Lakeville on June 26, 1863.{{sfnp|Bowen|1889|p=140-141}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Massachusetts in the Civil War]]\n* [[List of Massachusetts Civil War units]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv|title=Massachusetts in the War, 1861&ndash;1865 |last=Bowen |first=James L. |authorlink= |year=1889 |place=Springfield, Massachusetts |publisher=Clark W.

The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska counts Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje, they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of the male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village.

The document Croatian ban Nikola Erd\u00f6dy call Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a [[Zagreb Bishop Martin Borkovi\u0107a]] to allow colonization by Serbs Bovi\u0107 and Kirin, which were in possession bishops. Sometime later Petrinjska counts Erd\u00f6dy Francis, the year 1693. sets Prince Peter Draskovic for chief Serbs in Slabinji and other surrounding areas. Lower Banovina had their possessions the family of Croatian nobles [[House of Keglevi\u0107|Keglevi\u0107]]. Because of their possessions around Blinje, they were with the sukobljavali constantly Turks. For this reason, Croatian aristocrat Peter Keglevi\u0107 inhabits Wallachian families around Petrinja. The year 1697. leads Vlahe wrong. That same year, Serbs are settled in and around Sunja. Two years later, in 1699 was inhabited by \u017divaja.\n\nAfter World War II population in the village focused mainly on agricultural production and livestock breeding as the primary branches. The country's economy is run in a very primitive way, using animals to assist in a lot of human work. Were to chipped households, with a small number of livestock and small land parcel. Owing to its very difficult work, people were able to vegetate and recover from the terrors of war (1945 whole village was in ash). Productivity was very weak, and the daily work was hard and tiring. Because of proximity to city centers (Petrinja, Sisak, Zagreb) and the existence of traffic connections with those cities, industrialization development, the late fifties and early sixties of the last century, people are increasingly going to work in factories. A large part of the male population was employed in the cities. Thanks to daily migrations of people are, in addition to working in factories, managed to sustain agricultural production and even the more they build on a higher level. As time went by all over the went young people in the cities of the training.{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} Given the popularity of the then no life at the village and on agriculture, after schooling the young are mainly employed and remained in the cities.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1991, the average age of the population in the village increased, which points to the possibility that the working-age population largely fled the village. From the list of 1981.g. with 800 inhabitants, there was a drop to 726 on the list 1991.g.\n\n==Traffic connections==\nThrough the village [[\u017divaja]] passing road traffic categorized as the state of roads and carrying the label D224.\n\nThe railroad that passes parallel to the village, the distance of about 300 meters from the construction zone [[villages]], classified in the category of tracks from the importance of international trade.

Here is how he described his expedition:{{sfn|Maudslay|Maudslay|1899|p=37-39}}\n\n{{quote | [...] we arranged to start the very next day for the village of [[Alotenango]]. On 7 January we left that village about 7 o'clock in the morning with seven Mozos, carrying food, clothing, and my camp-bed, and rode for an hour towards the mountains, when we dismounted and sent back our mules. The first two hours' climb was not so very steep, but it was tiring work walking over the loose mould and dry leaves under the thick forest. [...] we recommenced our climb under shadow of the forest by a steep path cut through the undergrowth. At the height of about 9500 feet we, for the first time since starting, got a sight of the peak rising on the other side of a deep ravine. The whole of the slope on which we looked was bare of vegetation, and presented to the eye nothing but desolate slopes of ashes and scoriae broken higher up with patches of burnt rock; we scrambled on through the thick undergrowth, often with loose earth under foot, and by degrees the vegetation changed and we got amongst the pine-trees. At about 11,200 feet we came to a spot where the earth had been levelled for a few yards by the Indians, and there we determined to pass the night. [...] then returned and watched the reflection of the sunset over the more distant peaks and against the perfect cone of [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua|Agua]]. [...] but the cold which followed the sunset soon took all our attention. [...] We turned out of our shelter at about half-past four in the morning, and felt all the better after drinking hot coffee ; we then sat for an hour watching a most beautiful dawn and sunrise. At the opposite side of the valley rose the Volcano of Agua, sloping on one side to the plain of [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], and on the other in a long unbroken sweep to the sea, more than forty miles away. Peak after peak stood out against the red light into the far distance, and on the right the low coast-line and the sea showed up very clearly. As soon as the sun was up we started for the summit. I stopped on the way to get a photograph of the cone, which lay to the left of us as we ascended ; but the clouds came over just as I was ready, and I had to give it up. A little over 12,000 feet we left the scraggy pine-trees and arrived at the northern end of a cinder ridge, called the Meseta, which is at the summit of the slope we had been climbing. |\nAlfred Percival Maudslay | A Glimpse at Guatemala}}\n\n==Notable eruptions==\n[[File:A glimpse of Guatemala 39-firepeak mesta.JPG|thumb|Volc\u00e1n de Fuego summit as seen from the saddle that separates it from [[volc\u00e1n Acatenango]] in 1899.

In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=103}}\n\nOn 27 August there was a strong eruption of Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, which lasted until 30 August; the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the Cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego. On 29 August a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel. Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00&nbsp;pm there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock. The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=104}}\n\nThe San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed. There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower and extensive damage to the city infrastructure; not to mention numerous dead and injured.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=104}} These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity. City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of elements in the Army Battalion to safeguard the order was considerable.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}} The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720; although there are indications that there were more jobs done by Porres until 1736.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}\n\nIn 1773, the [[Santa Marta earthquake]]s destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}} The [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Crown]] ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where [[Guatemala City]], the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}}\n\n===Eruption of 3 June 2018===\n{{Main|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\nBeginning in 2002, the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego entered a new active period, with more or less continuous activity, interspersed with monthly eruptive episodes.

Here is how he described his expedition:{{sfn|Maudslay|Maudslay|1899|p=37-39}}\n\n{{quote | [...] we arranged to start the very next day for the village of [[Alotenango]]. On 7 January we left that village about 7 o'clock in the morning with seven Mozos, carrying food, clothing, and my camp-bed, and rode for an hour towards the mountains, when we dismounted and sent back our mules. The first two hours' climb was not so very steep, but it was tiring work walking over the loose mould and dry leaves under the thick forest. [...] we recommenced our climb under shadow of the forest by a steep path cut through the undergrowth. At the height of about 9500 feet we, for the first time since starting, got a sight of the peak rising on the other side of a deep ravine. The whole of the slope on which we looked was bare of vegetation, and presented to the eye nothing but desolate slopes of ashes and scoriae broken higher up with patches of burnt rock; we scrambled on through the thick undergrowth, often with loose earth under foot, and by degrees the vegetation changed and we got amongst the pine-trees. At about 11,200 feet we came to a spot where the earth had been levelled for a few yards by the Indians, and there we determined to pass the night. [...] then returned and watched the reflection of the sunset over the more distant peaks and against the perfect cone of [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua|Agua]]. [...] but the cold which followed the sunset soon took all our attention. [...] We turned out of our shelter at about half-past four in the morning, and felt all the better after drinking hot coffee ; we then sat for an hour watching a most beautiful dawn and sunrise. At the opposite side of the valley rose the Volcano of Agua, sloping on one side to the plain of [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], and on the other in a long unbroken sweep to the sea, more than forty miles away. Peak after peak stood out against the red light into the far distance, and on the right the low coast-line and the sea showed up very clearly. As soon as the sun was up we started for the summit. I stopped on the way to get a photograph of the cone, which lay to the left of us as we ascended ; but the clouds came over just as I was ready, and I had to give it up. A little over 12,000 feet we left the scraggy pine-trees and arrived at the northern end of a cinder ridge, called the Meseta, which is at the summit of the slope we had been climbing. |\nAlfred Percival Maudslay | A Glimpse at Guatemala}}\n\n==Notable eruptions==\n[[File:A glimpse of Guatemala 39-firepeak mesta.JPG|thumb|Volc\u00e1n de Fuego summit as seen from the saddle that separates it from [[volc\u00e1n Acatenango]] in 1899.

In the city, people also believed that the proximity of the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego (English: Volcano of Fire) was the cause of earthquakes; the great architect Diego de Porres even said that all the earthquakes were caused by volcano explosions.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=103}}\n\nOn 27 August there was a strong eruption of Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, which lasted until 30 August; the residents of the city asked for help to Santo Cristo of the Cathedral and to the Virgen del Socorro who were sworn patrons of the Volcan de Fuego. On 29 August a Virgen del Rosario procession took to the streets after a century without leaving her temple, and there were many more holy processions until 29 September, the day of San Miguel. Early afternoon earthquakes were minor, but at about 7:00&nbsp;pm there was a strong earthquake that forced residents to leave their homes; tremors and rumblings followed until four o'clock. The neighbors took to the streets and loudly confessed their sins, bracing for the worst.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=104}}\n\nThe San Miguel earthquake damaged the city considerably, to the point that some rooms and walls of the Royal Palace were destroyed. There was also a partial abandonment of the city, food shortages, lack of manpower and extensive damage to the city infrastructure; not to mention numerous dead and injured.{{sfn|Melchor Toledo|2011|p=104}} These earthquakes made the authorities consider moving to a new city less prone to seismic activity. City residents strongly opposed the move, and even took to the Royal Palace in protest; in the end, the city did not move, but the number of elements in the Army Battalion to safeguard the order was considerable.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}} The damage to the palace was repaired by Diego de Porres, who finished repairs in 1720; although there are indications that there were more jobs done by Porres until 1736.{{sfn|Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n|Flores|Garnica|1995|p=585}}\n\nIn 1773, the [[Santa Marta earthquake]]s destroyed much of the town, which led to the third change in location for the city.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}} The [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Crown]] ordered, in 1776, the removal of the capital to a safer location, the Valley of the Shrine, where [[Guatemala City]], the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands. This new city did not retain its old name and was christened Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci\u00f3n (New Guatemala of the Assumption), and its patron saint is Our Lady of the Assumption. The badly damaged city of Santiago de los Caballeros was ordered abandoned, although not everyone left, and was thereafter referred to as la Antigua Guatemala (the Old Guatemala).{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}}\n\n===Eruption of 3 June 2018===\n{{Main|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\nBeginning in 2002, the Volc\u00e1n de Fuego entered a new active period, with more or less continuous activity, interspersed with monthly eruptive episodes.
