It was written by producers [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]]. The pilot was directed by [[Mario Azzopardi]].\n\n\"Children of the Gods\" is about the re-establishment of the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate program]] after the events of the [[Stargate (film)|original 1994 film]]. The story follows six characters from the film and three new ones created for the series. The central plot involves [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Apophis|Apophis]] attacking the [[Stargate Program#Stargate Command|Stargate Command]] (SGC) and the surviving soldiers from the attack believing him to be [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Ra|Ra]] from the film.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2009/07/in-stores-today-children-of-the-gods-final-cut/ In Stores Today: Children of the Gods - Final Cut] gateworld.net, July 2009</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Background===\nOne year previously, as depicted in the movie ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', Colonel [[Jack O'Neill]] led a team through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] to the planet [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Abydonians|Abydos]]. After killing the [[Goa'uld]] [[Goa'uld#System Lords|System Lord]] [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Ra|Ra]] with a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], O'Neill returned to [[Earth]] with two survivors of his team, [[List of recurring Earth characters in Stargate SG-1#Charles Kawalsky|Charles Kawalsky]] and [[List of recurring Earth characters in Stargate SG-1#Louis Ferretti|Louis Ferretti]].  They leave behind Dr. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]], with his new love [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Sha're|Sha're]] (called Sha'uri in the movie) and her brother [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Skaara|Skaara]].\n\n===Part 1===\nThe series starts in the empty Embarkation Room of the empty Stargate Command which has been left almost completely empty as a result of the Stargate Program being shut down. In the Embarkation Room, four male airmen, two of whom are Airman 1st Class Fryatt and Staff Sergeant McAfee. The four are joined by Senior Airman Carol Weterings and despite the game going, Weterings expresses doubt about being in the room. Seconds later, the  Stargate apparently activates on its own, and the Goa'uld System Lord [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Apophis|Apophis]] and several [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] soldiers come through to the Stargate Command base at the [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]]. Weterings is rendered unconscious while her four colleagues including Fryatt and McAfee are killed in the ensuing firefight. The attacker then depart through the Stargate after General Hammond and his soldiers secured the room. Soon after this event, O'Neill ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]) is re-called to Cheyenne Mountain by [[Major General]] [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]] ([[Don S. Davis]]). He is questioned along with his former teammates Charles Kawalsky ([[Jay Acovone]]) and Louis Ferretti ([[Brent Stait]]), about their mission to Abydos. When they refuse to reveal anything other than what is in their reports, General Hammond chooses to send a nuclear bomb through the Stargate to Abydos, believing that the aliens could only have come from Abydos and hoping to destroy whoever came through.\n\nO'Neill reveals that he had lied about using the bomb to destroy Abydos. He admits that while the alien Ra was killed, the people of Abydos are still alive and Dr. Daniel Jackson ([[Michael Shanks]]) is living among them. After talking to his superiors, Hammond allows O'Neill to send a tissue box through the Stargate. The box is returned, proving that Jackson is alive and well, O'Neill is recalled to active duty, regains his rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and is given permission to take a team through the Stargate to Abydos to investigate the alien invaders. A team is assembled which includes O'Neill, Kawalsky, Ferretti, and Captain/Dr. [[Samantha Carter]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]), along with several others. When they step through the Stargate, they find a group of Abydonians waiting for them, armed with military weapons from Earth.\n\nDaniel leads O'Neill, Kawalsky, and Carter to a large cavernous room that has innumerable [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s on the walls. Jackson reveals that he believes that the hieroglyphs of the [[cartouche]] match the various symbols on the Stargate, leading him to believe that the walls are actually a map of the coordinates of a vast network of Stargates across the [[galaxy]]. While O'Neill and the others are away from the Stargate, the base camp nearby is attacked by the same invaders who attacked the SGC earlier in the episode. The leader's eyes glow, causing many of the survivors to believe that he is Ra. The invaders take Sha're ([[Vaitiare Bandera]]) and Skaara ([[Alexis Cruz]], from the 1994 film) with them. Determined to save his wife and brother-in-law, Daniel accompanies O'Neill and his team back to Earth. When the injured Ferretti is able to reveal the symbols that the invaders used to leave Abydos, General Hammond is given permission by the [[President of the United States]] to form nine teams who will use the Stargate to gather information about threats to Earth. O'Neill is given command of the team designated \"SG-1\", with Carter as his [[second-in-command]] and Jackson accompanying him. Kawalsky is given command of SG-2.\n\n===Part 2===\nOn another planet, SG-1 encounters a group of monks who escort them to the town of [[Mythology of Stargate#Jaffa|Chulak]]. They find out that Sha're has been possessed by a [[Goa'uld]], and the team is taken prisoner.\n\nThe team finds Skaara inside the prison. Jackson explains that it was not Ra who attacked them, but [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Apophis|Apophis]]. Before Skaara and SG-1 can escape, Apophis and the possessed Sha're enter with several guards. Several prisoners are chosen to become hosts to the \"children of the Gods\". Skaara is among the chosen and is dragged away, screaming frantically for O'Neill. Apophis orders that the rest of the prisoners be killed. The guards prepare to execute his orders, but O'Neill desperately convinces [[Teal'c]], Apophis' morally conflicted First Prime, that he can save his people. Teal'c turns on his fellow guards, helping O'Neill and the other prisoners escape.\n\nO'Neill, Carter, Jackson, and Teal'c lead the prisoners away from Chulak toward the Stargate, with guards pursuing them. Teal'c shows O'Neill that he has a Goa'uld inside him, much to the shock of the others. Near the gate, SG-1 is pinned down by a Goa'uld troop carrier that has transformed into a death glider. (This transformation and the troop carrier appear only in the pilot, and were not continued into the series proper; the 2009 DVD version replaces the transformable ship with a trio of ships that match the later series continuity.) They are rescued by SG-2, who destroy the ship with a rocket launcher. At the gate they find Apophis' troops leaving with the prisoners. O'Neill gains Skaara's attention, but Skaara is already possessed by a Goa'uld. Skaara uses a hand device to knock down O'Neill and escape through the gate. As a [[battalion]] of Jaffa attacks their position, Jackson opens the Stargate and leads the prisoners through it. Before Kawalsky steps through the Stargate, he is invaded by an infant Goa'uld, unknown to the others.\n\nAfter the battle, Jackson and O'Neill reaffirm their determination to find Sha're and Skaara and rescue them. O'Neill asks General Hammond to make Teal'c a member of their team, but the General says it is not his decision. As everyone leaves the gate room, Kawalsky's eyes glow like a Goa'uld.\n\n==Release and reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer Tony Scott criticized that \"superficial characters wander through their roles without stirring a modicum of conviction\". He mocked that the wooden acting, \"pedestrian writing, pulp-mag plotting, shopworn characters, hackneyed dialogue [...] and Mario Azzopardi's broad direction will all undoubtedly delight billions and billions\". He predicted that the series is \"essentially for young people\", and that \"if no one else, the kiddies are probably watching\" but that it didn't stop the producers from \"blatantly showcasing naked young women\".<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite magazine|author=Tony Scott |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911984.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |title=Stargate SG-1 | date= July 28, 1997 |magazine=Variety Magazine | accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> Will Joyner from ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered ''Stargate SG-1'' as a \"challenging, if derivative, mix\" that is \"more than a ''Stargate'' [feature film] fan might expect but certainly less than one would hope for\". His opinion about the main cast was mixed, and he found it disturbing that ''SG-1'' used shock tactics to make up for its lower television budget. He would not recommend the show for children because of the \"grotesque physical attributes in the new villains\" and the \"gratuitous use of sexual implication and nudity\".<ref name=nyt_farside>{{cite news |last=Joyner |first=Will |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/arts/through-a-gate-to-the-far-side-of-the-universe-a-tv-series.html |title=Through a Gate to the Far Side of the Universe: A TV Series |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 26, 1997 |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> The episode got a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 3.3 / 3.4, -4.<ref name=\"childrenofthegods\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/sg1/s1/101.shtml |title=Children of the Gods |publisher=GateWorld | language=| accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\n\nFilming commenced in February 1997. The mountains around [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] served as backdrop for the alien world of Chulak. The first days of shooting on location were particularly tough for the production due to heavy wind and rain. Conditions were so tough, many of the cast and crew wondered if this was indicative of what working on the show was going to be like, with writer and producer Jonathan Glassner initially wondering if the series was jinxed.<ref name=\"gateworldjon1\">{{cite web |last1=Read |first1=David |title=Revelations An Interview With Jonathan Glassner |url=https://www.gateworld.net/news/2009/09/revelations/ |website=Gateworld |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Amongst the problems caused by the adverse weather was the entire first day's film being scratched, to the point it was mostly unusable. The noise generated by the wind and rain meant that dialog was at times entirely inaudible, with many cast members struggling to deliver their lines due to coldness - notably Christopher Judge who at times was unable to maintain the deep imposing voice of his character, Teal'c. Many of the costumes worn by extras were soaking wet and covered in mud as the day went on.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\">{{cite DVD notes |type=Commentary Track |others=[[Brad Wright]], Richard Dean Anderson |id= |titlelink=Children of the Gods|origyear=1997 |title=Children of the Gods - The Final Cut |publisher=MGM |year=2009}}</ref>\n\nProblems continued over the following days as production moved to filming the teams escape the prison on Chulak. As the scene required the seamless transition of the characters escaping out of the prison and into the surrounding alien forest, production opted not to construct the prison on a soundstage, but rather to build the set on location, in the mountains. The weather caused the set to keep blowing over, and eventually production staff were enlisted to physically hold the walls in place during shooting, to stop the set collapsing.<ref name=\"gateworldjon1\"/> Another issue, as noted by writer and producer Brad Wright, was that the set was so big, they didn't have enough background actors to adequately fill it. Instead, just prior to shooting they had to move the walls to make the room smaller.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\"/>\n\n=== MPAA rating and subsequent edits ===\nThe episode's original airing on Showtime in 1997 featured full-frontal nudity during the scene showing the possession of [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Sha're|Sha're]] ([[Vaitiare Bandera]]) by Amonet. This has never been repeated, and future airings in the United States as well as Hulu and Amazon VOD prints have had the nudity cut out for syndication. The video releases, however, retain this scene. However, in the iTunes release of the episode, included as part of the Season 1 bundle, blurring has been applied to any visuals of the pubic region. This episode along with episodes two and three of the first season of the series are the only ones to be rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] for a scene of nudity, while in the UK the episode is rated 18 by the BBFC. It is rated M in Australia, recommended for (but not restricted to) viewers 15 and older. All other SG-1 episodes have generally been rated PG, or 15, at most.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmratings.com/ |title=Children of the Gods |publisher=Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA) |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' pilot episode (\"Children of the Gods\") was re-cut as a third ''Stargate SG-1'' direct-to-[[DVD]] special and released on July 21, 2009, in [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|16:9 widescreen]] format.  A few months before its release, executive producer Brad Wright announced it was to have with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version.

Weterings is rendered unconscious while her four colleagues including Fryatt and McAfee are killed in the ensuing firefight. The attacker then depart through the Stargate after General Hammond and his soldiers secured the room. Soon after this event, O'Neill ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]) is re-called to Cheyenne Mountain by [[Major General]] [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]] ([[Don S. Davis]]). He is questioned along with his former teammates Charles Kawalsky ([[Jay Acovone]]) and Louis Ferretti ([[Brent Stait]]), about their mission to Abydos. When they refuse to reveal anything other than what is in their reports, General Hammond chooses to send a nuclear bomb through the Stargate to Abydos, believing that the aliens could only have come from Abydos and hoping to destroy whoever came through.\n\nO'Neill reveals that he had lied about using the bomb to destroy Abydos. He admits that while the alien Ra was killed, the people of Abydos are still alive and Dr. Daniel Jackson ([[Michael Shanks]]) is living among them. After talking to his superiors, Hammond allows O'Neill to send a tissue box through the Stargate. The box is returned, proving that Jackson is alive and well, O'Neill is recalled to active duty, regains his rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and is given permission to take a team through the Stargate to Abydos to investigate the alien invaders. A team is assembled which includes O'Neill, Kawalsky, Ferretti, and Captain/Dr. [[Samantha Carter]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]), along with several others. When they step through the Stargate, they find a group of Abydonians waiting for them, armed with military weapons from Earth.\n\nDaniel leads O'Neill, Kawalsky, and Carter to a large cavernous room that has innumerable [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]s on the walls. Jackson reveals that he believes that the hieroglyphs of the [[cartouche]] match the various symbols on the Stargate, leading him to believe that the walls are actually a map of the coordinates of a vast network of Stargates across the [[galaxy]]. While O'Neill and the others are away from the Stargate, the base camp nearby is attacked by the same invaders who attacked the SGC earlier in the episode. The leader's eyes glow, causing many of the survivors to believe that he is Ra. The invaders take Sha're ([[Vaitiare Bandera]]) and Skaara ([[Alexis Cruz]], from the 1994 film) with them. Determined to save his wife and brother-in-law, Daniel accompanies O'Neill and his team back to Earth. When the injured Ferretti is able to reveal the symbols that the invaders used to leave Abydos, General Hammond is given permission by the [[President of the United States]] to form nine teams who will use the Stargate to gather information about threats to Earth. O'Neill is given command of the team designated \"SG-1\", with Carter as his [[second-in-command]] and Jackson accompanying him. Kawalsky is given command of SG-2.\n\n===Part 2===\nOn another planet, SG-1 encounters a group of monks who escort them to the town of [[Mythology of Stargate#Jaffa|Chulak]]. They find out that Sha're has been possessed by a [[Goa'uld]], and the team is taken prisoner.\n\nThe team finds Skaara inside the prison. Jackson explains that it was not Ra who attacked them, but [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Apophis|Apophis]]. Before Skaara and SG-1 can escape, Apophis and the possessed Sha're enter with several guards. Several prisoners are chosen to become hosts to the \"children of the Gods\". Skaara is among the chosen and is dragged away, screaming frantically for O'Neill. Apophis orders that the rest of the prisoners be killed. The guards prepare to execute his orders, but O'Neill desperately convinces [[Teal'c]], Apophis' morally conflicted First Prime, that he can save his people. Teal'c turns on his fellow guards, helping O'Neill and the other prisoners escape.\n\nO'Neill, Carter, Jackson, and Teal'c lead the prisoners away from Chulak toward the Stargate, with guards pursuing them. Teal'c shows O'Neill that he has a Goa'uld inside him, much to the shock of the others. Near the gate, SG-1 is pinned down by a Goa'uld troop carrier that has transformed into a death glider. (This transformation and the troop carrier appear only in the pilot, and were not continued into the series proper; the 2009 DVD version replaces the transformable ship with a trio of ships that match the later series continuity.) They are rescued by SG-2, who destroy the ship with a rocket launcher. At the gate they find Apophis' troops leaving with the prisoners. O'Neill gains Skaara's attention, but Skaara is already possessed by a Goa'uld. Skaara uses a hand device to knock down O'Neill and escape through the gate. As a [[battalion]] of Jaffa attacks their position, Jackson opens the Stargate and leads the prisoners through it. Before Kawalsky steps through the Stargate, he is invaded by an infant Goa'uld, unknown to the others.\n\nAfter the battle, Jackson and O'Neill reaffirm their determination to find Sha're and Skaara and rescue them. O'Neill asks General Hammond to make Teal'c a member of their team, but the General says it is not his decision. As everyone leaves the gate room, Kawalsky's eyes glow like a Goa'uld.\n\n==Release and reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer Tony Scott criticized that \"superficial characters wander through their roles without stirring a modicum of conviction\". He mocked that the wooden acting, \"pedestrian writing, pulp-mag plotting, shopworn characters, hackneyed dialogue [...] and Mario Azzopardi's broad direction will all undoubtedly delight billions and billions\". He predicted that the series is \"essentially for young people\", and that \"if no one else, the kiddies are probably watching\" but that it didn't stop the producers from \"blatantly showcasing naked young women\".<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite magazine|author=Tony Scott |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911984.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |title=Stargate SG-1 | date= July 28, 1997 |magazine=Variety Magazine | accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> Will Joyner from ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered ''Stargate SG-1'' as a \"challenging, if derivative, mix\" that is \"more than a ''Stargate'' [feature film] fan might expect but certainly less than one would hope for\". His opinion about the main cast was mixed, and he found it disturbing that ''SG-1'' used shock tactics to make up for its lower television budget. He would not recommend the show for children because of the \"grotesque physical attributes in the new villains\" and the \"gratuitous use of sexual implication and nudity\".<ref name=nyt_farside>{{cite news |last=Joyner |first=Will |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/arts/through-a-gate-to-the-far-side-of-the-universe-a-tv-series.html |title=Through a Gate to the Far Side of the Universe: A TV Series |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 26, 1997 |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> The episode got a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 3.3 / 3.4, -4.<ref name=\"childrenofthegods\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/sg1/s1/101.shtml |title=Children of the Gods |publisher=GateWorld | language=| accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\n\nFilming commenced in February 1997. The mountains around [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] served as backdrop for the alien world of Chulak. The first days of shooting on location were particularly tough for the production due to heavy wind and rain. Conditions were so tough, many of the cast and crew wondered if this was indicative of what working on the show was going to be like, with writer and producer Jonathan Glassner initially wondering if the series was jinxed.<ref name=\"gateworldjon1\">{{cite web |last1=Read |first1=David |title=Revelations An Interview With Jonathan Glassner |url=https://www.gateworld.net/news/2009/09/revelations/ |website=Gateworld |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Amongst the problems caused by the adverse weather was the entire first day's film being scratched, to the point it was mostly unusable. The noise generated by the wind and rain meant that dialog was at times entirely inaudible, with many cast members struggling to deliver their lines due to coldness - notably Christopher Judge who at times was unable to maintain the deep imposing voice of his character, Teal'c. Many of the costumes worn by extras were soaking wet and covered in mud as the day went on.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\">{{cite DVD notes |type=Commentary Track |others=[[Brad Wright]], Richard Dean Anderson |id= |titlelink=Children of the Gods|origyear=1997 |title=Children of the Gods - The Final Cut |publisher=MGM |year=2009}}</ref>\n\nProblems continued over the following days as production moved to filming the teams escape the prison on Chulak. As the scene required the seamless transition of the characters escaping out of the prison and into the surrounding alien forest, production opted not to construct the prison on a soundstage, but rather to build the set on location, in the mountains. The weather caused the set to keep blowing over, and eventually production staff were enlisted to physically hold the walls in place during shooting, to stop the set collapsing.<ref name=\"gateworldjon1\"/> Another issue, as noted by writer and producer Brad Wright, was that the set was so big, they didn't have enough background actors to adequately fill it. Instead, just prior to shooting they had to move the walls to make the room smaller.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\"/>\n\n=== MPAA rating and subsequent edits ===\nThe episode's original airing on Showtime in 1997 featured full-frontal nudity during the scene showing the possession of [[List of recurring alien characters in Stargate SG-1#Sha're|Sha're]] ([[Vaitiare Bandera]]) by Amonet. This has never been repeated, and future airings in the United States as well as Hulu and Amazon VOD prints have had the nudity cut out for syndication. The video releases, however, retain this scene. However, in the iTunes release of the episode, included as part of the Season 1 bundle, blurring has been applied to any visuals of the pubic region. This episode along with episodes two and three of the first season of the series are the only ones to be rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] for a scene of nudity, while in the UK the episode is rated 18 by the BBFC. It is rated M in Australia, recommended for (but not restricted to) viewers 15 and older. All other SG-1 episodes have generally been rated PG, or 15, at most.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmratings.com/ |title=Children of the Gods |publisher=Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA) |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' pilot episode (\"Children of the Gods\") was re-cut as a third ''Stargate SG-1'' direct-to-[[DVD]] special and released on July 21, 2009, in [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|16:9 widescreen]] format.  A few months before its release, executive producer Brad Wright announced it was to have with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version.
