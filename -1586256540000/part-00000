Michigan Chamber of Commerce]], McLellan argued the Michigan Campaign Finance Act, which prohibited corporations from using treasury money to support or oppose candidates in elections, violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]]. The Court upheld the restriction on corporate speech based on the notion that \"[c]orporate wealth can unfairly influence elections,\" and the Michigan law still allowed the corporation to make contributions from a segregated fund. McLellan filed an [[amicus curiae]] for [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]], 558 U.S. 50 (2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/08-205.htm |title=Search - Supreme Court of the United States |publisher=Supremecourt.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref> the case in which Austin was overturned.<ref>Founding Board Member Vindicated by Landmark First Amendment Case, https://www.mackinac.org/13847</ref>\n\n==Legislation==\n\n=== Michigan's Medical Marijuana Law ===\nMcLellan, along with his former firm [[Dykema Gossett]], helped write the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA), which was approved by Michigan voters on November 4, 2008.  He is quoted in the ''[[City Pulse]]'' as saying \"We think there is a role in this emergent medical marijuana market for an entity that really focuses on the quality and issues related to those persons who most benefit medically from marijuana.\"  He believes that there needs to be legitimacy in the relationship between doctor and patient so that medical marijuana can be properly tested and prescribed to meet patient needs.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNamara |first=Neal |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-4337-will-of-the-people.html |title=Will of the people |publisher=Lansingcitypulse.com |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Michigan's Stem Cell Amendment ===\nMcLellan was retained by The Cure Michigan Campaign to review law relating to Stem Cell regulation in Michigan and assisted in drafting a proposed constitutional amendment to guarantee embryonic stem cell research ([[Michigan State Proposal \u2013 08-2 (2008)|Michigan's Stem Cell Legislation]]). The amendment was passed by Michigan voters on November, 4th 2008.

The Michigan Supreme Court upheld the public charter school law, but neither of the proposals to provide public funding to private schools has been successful.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mclellan, Richard}}\n[[Category:Michigan lawyers]]\n[[Category:Lawyers who have represented the United States government]]\n[[Category:Michigan State University faculty]]\n[[Category:Michigan State University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Michigan Republicans]]\n[[Category:People from Paw Paw, Michigan]]\n[[Category:People from Lansing, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Mackinac Center for Public Policy]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toRonald Brown(link changed toRon Brown) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._McLellan"}
