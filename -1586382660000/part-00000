It is intended to be an installment of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]].<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS WORDING WITHOUT NEW TALK PAGE CONSENSUS. --> The film was directed by [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]] from a screenplay by himself and Knate Lee, and stars [[Maisie Williams]], [[Anya Taylor-Joy]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Blu Hunt]], and [[Henry Zaga]]. In the film, a group of young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] held in a secret facility fight to save themselves.\n\nThis film might be rated 18 by the BBFC.\n\nBoone and Lee first began work on the film after Boone completed ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' (2014). The pair pitched a potential film trilogy to ''X-Men'' producer [[Simon Kinberg]], and in May 2015 were officially signed on to the project. Taylor-Joy and Williams were rumored to be cast in March 2016, and were confirmed over a year later when the rest of the cast filled out. Filming took place in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], from July to September 2017, primarily at [[Medfield State Hospital]], with an April 2018 release in mind. The film was then delayed while reshoots were planned and [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|Disney began the process of acquiring production company 20th Century Fox]]. After the acquisition was completed, Boone returned to work on the film, and it was completed without reshoots in March 2020. \n\n''The New Mutants'' has had several release dates since it was first announced, and was most recently scheduled for release in the United States on April 3, 2020. Disney removed the film from its schedule in March 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the intention of rescheduling the film for a later 2020 date. Boone has said that original planned trilogy was unlikely to happen due to Disney's [[Marvel Studios]] gaining control of the characters.\n\n==Premise==\nFive young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" />\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maisie Williams]] as [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane]]:<br />A Scottish mutant who can turn into a wolf and is struggling to reconcile this with her religious beliefs.<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /> Williams was convinced to join the film after discussing the character's religious background with director [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]], who identified with the comic book character due to his own strict religious upbringing.<ref name=\"WilliamsSameSex\" /> \n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Illyana Rasputin / Magik]]:<br />A Russian mutant with sorcery powers,<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /> she can manifest the [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)#Soulsword|Soulsword]] and use teleportation discs to travel.<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /><ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" /> Illyana is the sister of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], a member of the X-Men seen in previous films in the series.<ref name=\"TaylorJoyWilliams\" /> Her purple dragon companion from the comic books, [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], also appears in the film.<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" />\n* [[Charlie Heaton]] as [[Cannonball (comics)|Sam Guthrie / Cannonball]]: An American mutant who can propel himself into the air, and is invulnerable while doing so.<ref name=\"Heaton\" />\n* [[Alice Braga]] as [[Cecilia Reyes]]: A mentor to the group and a medical doctor who can generate protective fields around herself.<ref name=\"Braga\" />\n* [[Blu Hunt]] as [[Danielle Moonstar|Danielle Moonstar / Mirage]]:<br />A Native American mutant who can create illusions based on the fears and desires of other people.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> The film includes a love story between Rahne and Dani which Williams felt was a natural extension of the comic book characters having a telepathic connection.

The pair had been fans of the characters growing up, with Boone calling the stories \"really dark, interesting, and different from the typical [[X-Men]] stories that we had read\". Boone and Lee took the comic to [[Simon Kinberg]], one of the producers of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], who \"really liked it\".<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /> In May 2015, Fox finalized a deal to have Boone direct ''The New Mutants'', from a script by himself and Lee, with Kinberg and [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] producing. The film would be a standalone spinoff film, expanding the universe of the ''X-Men'' franchise.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> While working on the first draft of the script, Boone sent it and his ideas for the film to Sienkiewicz, who thought Boone \"had it figured out\" and was not just copying the comics.<ref name=\"CCXP17\" />\n\nUpdating the status of the film in March 2016, Kinberg said that Boone and Lee were working on the script, and that, like ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016), the film would be different from the core ''X-Men'' films, \"maybe not as different as ''Deadpool'', but it has its own unique, original voice to it\". Kinberg said that the film would have a [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] \"vibe\", and that there was potential for characters seen in previous films to appear, namely [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], and [[Professor X]], who all have ties to the New Mutants in the comics.<ref name=\"KinbergIGNMar2016\" /> Also at that time, it was reported that [[Maisie Williams]] and [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] were being looked at to star in the film as [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane]] and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin / Magik]], respectively. The rest of the title team was expected to consist of the characters [[Cannonball (comics)|Sam Guthrie / Cannonball]], Roberto da Costa / Sunspot, and [[Danielle Moonstar|Danielle Moonstar / Mirage]].<ref name=\"HitFixMar2016\" /> Sunspot previously appeared in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', portrayed by [[Adan Canto]], who was not confirmed to be returning for the new film.<ref name=\"Canto\" /> [[James McAvoy]], who portrayed Professor X in several previous ''X-Men'' films, was said to have a significant role in this one, alongside [[Alexandra Shipp]], who was expected to reprise her role of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] from ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"HitFixMar2016\" />\n\nIn May 2016, Kinberg confirmed that the script included Professor X, and stated his hope for filming to start at the beginning of 2017.<ref name=\"KinbergColliderMay2016\" /> By that August, the titular team's roster had expanded to include the character [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], while [[Scott Neustadter]] and [[Michael H. Weber]]\u2014who worked with Boone writing ''The Fault in Our Stars''\u2014were working on a new draft of the script while Boone and Lee were busy on another project.<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /><ref name=\"NeustadterWeber\" /> In November, the report of Williams and Taylor-Joy's casting was believed to be accurate, and [[Nat Wolff]] was being looked at for the role of Cannonball after working with Boone on ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The character [[Demon Bear]] was set as the film's main antagonist, with the project aiming for more of a \"'[[Stephen King]] meets [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]'-style horror movie\".<ref name=\"CSExclusive\" /> Boone soon noted that the Demon Bear was a very personal villain for him as a child, as he \"was raised by very religious parents. They were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]] and they believed in the [[rapture]]; they believed [[Satan#Christianity|the devil]] was real; they believed in [[Demon#Christianity|demons]].\"<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" /><ref name=\"BooneCS\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe film had entered pre-production in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], by April 2017, in preparation for filming to begin in that city. Location scouting took place, including at [[Medfield State Hospital]] which was previously used as a filming location for ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"PreProd\" /> Fox scheduled ''New Mutants'' for an April 13, 2018 release.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Several weeks later, the studio officially announced the casting of Taylor-Joy and Williams, and was \"making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors\" for the rest of the cast, searching for South American and Native American actors to respectively play Sunspot and Moonstar. By then, McAvoy was no longer slated to appear in the film;<ref name=\"NoMcAvoyWolff\" /> Wolff was no longer in the running to portray Cannonball;<ref name=\"NoMcAvoyWolff\" /> and Karen Rosenfelt was producing alongside Kinberg,<ref name=\"TaylorJoyWilliams\" /> who ultimately spent much of production focused on making ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"TBReport\" />\n\nAt the end of May, [[Henry Zaga]] was expected to be cast as Sunspot,<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" /> and [[Rosario Dawson]]\u2014who also portrays the Marvel character [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] across the various [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix television series]]\u2014was in talks to join the film as [[Cecilia Reyes]], a mentor to the titular team. It was explained that McAvoy was no longer involved due to Professor X being written out of the script with further drafts, and Shipp's Storm had likewise been written out of the film.<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /> Additionally, Boone confirmed that the film would be \"a full-fledged horror movie set within the ''X-Men'' universe. There are no costumes. There are no supervillains. We're trying to do something very, very different.\"<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" /> Boone had previously stated that he does not like horror films, except for \"classic ones\" such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), but was looking to \"pioneer and champion doing prestige versions of horror films\" based on his love for horror novels such as King's works.<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /> At the end of the month, [[Charlie Heaton]] was in talks to portray Cannonball.<ref name=\"Heaton\" />\n\nZaga, Dawson, and Heaton were confirmed to have been cast at the start of June,<ref name=\"Hunt\" /><ref name=\"Zaga\" /> and newcomer [[Blu Hunt]] was cast as Moonstar after an extensive and challenging international search that prioritized \"ethnic authenticity\". The character was believed to be central to the Demon Bear storyline that the film focuses on.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> At the end of that month, Dawson exited the film, and [[Alice Braga]] was cast as Reyes in her place.<ref name=\"Braga\" /> The final shooting script for the film included contributions from Josh Zetumer, [[Chad Hayes (writer)|Chad]] and [[Carey W. Hayes|Carey Hayes]], and [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], along with a six-person \"writer's room\" that Fox hired to generate ideas for the film and also \"tear apart the script and put it back together\". Throughout the development process on the film, the script evolved from the \"full horror\" film that Boone and Lee initially wanted to make, and which Fox was resistant to, to a compromise version without \"excessive blood and scares\" and more \"young adult\"-focused.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /> Boone created storyboards with artist Ashley R. Guillory to plan out all of the shots before filming.<ref name=\"Storyboards\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 10, 2017, in Boston, under the [[working title]] ''Growing Pains''.<ref name=\"PreProd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBegan\" /><ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Peter Deming]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name=\"FilmingBegan\" /> The majority of the film was shot on location at [[Medfield State Hospital]], where Boone said every crew member had \"weird things happen to them\". Boone wanted to use practical effects as much as possible to make the film feel like the horror movies that he grew up with. For example, he had actors push on sheets of [[spandex]] to create the effect of figures pushing through the walls of a room, a technique originated by [[Wes Craven]]. Ten percent of the film used [[green screen]].<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> On the film's set, Boone explained that the script had been re-written following the failure of ''Apocalypse'' to be set during modern day rather than in the 1980s, which is why Professor X and Storm were removed from the film's story. Boone felt the film was not largely affected by this change since its confined location and lack of technology meant \"it might as well be the 80s in terms of the setting. It didn't change our story very much.\"<ref name=\"SRSetVisit\" />\n\nFox chairman and CEO [[Stacey Snider]] elaborated on the film's setting, describing it as a ''[[The Breakfast Club|Breakfast Club]]'' detention crossed with a ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|Cuckoo's Nest]]'' institution. She described the film's genre as \"a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers. We haven't seen a superhero movie whose genre is more like ''The Shining'' than {{'}}we're teenagers let's save the world.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"SniderSep2017\" /> Boone added that he was influenced by ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' (1987);<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> explained that Warlock had been deemed too expensive to portray on the film's budget, but could appear in a sequel;<ref name=\"TBReport\" /><ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> and clarified that the Demon Bear would not be the main antagonist of the film, but that character would appear and the film was \"very much inspired\" by the comic book story arc in which that character is the main villain.<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> Filming ended on September 16, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> The film's principal photography was described as \"stressful\" for Boone, who felt \"a bit neutered\" during the process due to having to tone down the film from his original \"full horror\" ideas.<ref name=\"TBReport\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Initial cut====\nRobb Sullivan served as editor for the film.<ref name=\"Sullivan\" /> Boone delivered a cut of the film to Fox that he was happy with,<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> and it tested as well as initial screenings of ''Deadpool'' did with audiences. Three days of additional photography were planned to complete the \"YA movie\" that Boone, Lee, and Fox had agreed to make. However, following the successful release of the film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' (2017), the studio cut the first trailer for ''The New Mutants'' to focus on the \"scary elements from the film, essentially selling it as a straight-up horror movie\". This proved a success, and Fox decided to make the film more like Boone's original vision rather than completing the version that they had been making during production.<ref name=\"TBReport\" />\n\n====Planned reshoots====\nIn January 2018, the film's release date was pushed back to February 22, 2019.<ref name=\"Jan2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This allowed it to avoid ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018), which had just been moved to a date that would have had both films in theaters at the same time in certain markets.<ref name=\"THRReleaseDelay\" /> It also allowed time for the reshoots required to make the film more frightening.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /><ref name=\"Scarier\" /><ref name=\"Scarier2\" /> When asked about this delay the next month, Williams stated that there had been concerns during filming regarding the short turnaround from the end of photography to the previously set release date, especially with the amount of visual effects still needed to finish the film, and so in her opinion the delay was \"for the better\".<ref name=\"WilliamsDelay\" /> The additional photography was soon set for mid-2018. It was expected to include the addition of several new characters who would be appearing throughout the film rather than just making cameo appearances.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /><ref name=\"UniversePlans2018\" />\n\nFox again delayed the film's release in March 2018, moving it away from the new February 2019 release date for ''Dark Phoenix'' to August 2, 2019;<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> by then, the reshoots required for the film were believed to be more extensive than previously considered, with the studio now wanting at least half of the film to be reshot. The studio's focus was on making the film as distinct from the other entries in the series as ''Deadpool'' and ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> while avoiding the film becoming a \"flop\" like ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2015) which went through similar production issues\u2014industry insiders believed ''The New Mutants'' would not end up the same way due to Fox not blaming the issues on Boone as the studio did with ''Fantastic Four'' director [[Josh Trank]], and also because the studio was allowing Boone to write and direct the reshoots in order to complete his original vision. In addition to the reshoots changing the tone of the film, they were also set to adjust an antagonist subplot in the film: ''The New Mutants'' was originally going to feature the Essex Corporation, which was first teased at the end of ''X-Men: Apocalypse'', leading to a [[post-credits scene]] featuring the surprise reveal of [[Jon Hamm]] as the villain [[Mister Sinister]].<ref name=\"TBReport\" /> However, Fox decided against doing this following the failure of ''Apocalypse'' and so the reshoots would include a new post-credits scene introducing [[Antonio Banderas]] as Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /><ref name=\"BooneSequelPlans\" />\n\n====Disney acquisition====\nReshoots for the film were expected to begin by the end of September 2018, with Kinberg confirming that they were mostly focused on making the film more frightening after the positive response to the horror-inspired trailer. He added that \"audiences really embraced the notion of a superhero movie or a comic book movie that was, in its core, a horror film\".<ref name=\"KinbergSep2018Franchise\" /> Following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of Fox by Disney]] in March 2019, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that the planned reshoots had still not taken place and there were \"none planned so far\". The report indicated that further movement on the film appeared to be dependent on Boone,<ref name=\"THRMar2019\" /><ref name=\"THRMar2019Support\" /> and that there was a chance the film may not be released per its Fox release schedule and could instead be released on [[Disney+]] or [[Hulu]], both streaming services owned by Disney.<ref name=\"DisneyTHR\" /> A month later at [[CinemaCon]] 2019, Disney confirmed that the film was still planned but indicated that its release date could be adjusted to better fit within Disney's existing schedule.<ref name=\"CinemaCon2019\" /> A month after that, the studio pushed the film's release back to April 3, 2020,<ref name=\"May2019ReleaseDelay\" /> and the reshoots were set to take place later in 2019. Kinberg explained that the reshoots had taken so long to schedule because the creative team was still deciding what to reshoot, and because of difficulty finding time to get the cast together again due to their commitments to various television series.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2019\" />\n\nIn August 2019, Disney was said to be unimpressed with ''The New Mutants'', believing it had \"limited box office potential\".<ref name=\"FoxFlops\" /> At the end of the month, this was reported to be the studio's impression of the original cut of the film. Further work had been completed on the film since Disney acquired it to align the film with Boone's original vision, and test screenings with these changes had been positive. In addition to making the film more frightening, these changes included removing connections to the ''X-Men'' films. This was reportedly to give Disney's [[Marvel Studios]] the option to retroactively include the film in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"NoMoreXMen\" /> Sienkiewicz confirmed in December that work on the film had been taking place and that, based on a new trailer he had seen, the style of Marvel Studios appeared to have had an impact on the tone of the film.<ref name=\"SienkiewiczNewTrailer\" /> At the end of the month, Boone said the latest version of the film followed his original vision, a comment that was interpreted by some to mean no reshoots had taken place.<ref name=\"BooneJan2020\" /> In January 2020, Disney's official fan club website [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] described the film as a \"new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", a claim that was quickly picked up by fans and reporters. Soon after the claim was noticed, all mentions of the film were removed from the website. Disney later confirmed that this was an error and the film would not be part of the MCU.<ref name=\"D23\" />\n\n====Final cut====\nOn March 7, 2020, Boone stated that the film was complete.<ref name=\"BooneDone\" /> Shortly after, he explained that work on the film had halted when Disney's acquisition of Fox had begun and so no reshoots ever took place on the film, even standard pickups that had already been scheduled during initial production. At that time, around 75 percent of the film had been edited while much of the film's visual effects were also not finished. By the time the acquisition was completed, Boone had moved on and was about to begin work on a new television series, ''[[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|The Stand]]'', based on the Stephen King novel. Before he started production on that series, Disney asked Boone if he would return to finish the film.<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" />\n\nThe work required to finish the film when Boone returned involved completing the visual effects and editing alongside co-writer Lee, which took several months. Reshoots for the film could have been scheduled at that point, but Boone found that the cast had aged too much since principal photography had taken place.<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" /> He also felt it did not make sense to add the post-credit scenes of Banderas since it was unlikely that they would be able to make a sequel now that Disney owned the X-Men rights and was integrating the property into the MCU.<ref name=\"BooneSequelPlans\" /> Describing returning to the film after so long, Boone said, \"we hadn't seen it in a year. We did a bunch of things here and there that we hadn't thought about or noticed a year before.\" The visual effects that still needed to be finished included Illyana's sorceress abilities, including her [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)#Soulsword|Soulsword]] that she materializes, as well as her dragon companion [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]].<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" /> Visual effects for the film were provided by [[DNEG]], [[Method Studios]], and [[Moving Picture Company]], with Olivier Dumont serving as VFX supervisor.<ref name=\"ArtOfVFX\" /> After the film was completed, Boone reunited the cast for the first official screening in New York City, after which Williams stated, \"The movie is exactly the movie we set out to make.\"<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" />\n\nDisney removed ''The New Mutants'' from its release schedule, along with several other films, on March 12, 2020, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" /> This led to multiple online commentators referring to the film as \"cursed\" and lamenting its bad luck.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"Mar2020Curse\" /><ref name=\"Mar2020Curse2\" /> Disney said it was looking to reschedule the film's release to a later 2020 date.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" />\n\n==Music==\n[[Nate Walcott]] and [[Mike Mogis]] were confirmed in December 2017 to be composing the score for the film, having worked with Boone on his previous films.<ref name=\"WalcottMogis\" /> In May 2018, [[Marilyn Manson]] announced that his [[Cover version|cover]] of the song \"[[Cry Little Sister]]\"\u2014originally written for the film ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987) by [[Gerard McMahon]]\u2014which Manson debuted during his ''[[Heaven Upside Down]]'' tour, had been recorded specifically for the ''New Mutants'' soundtrack.<ref name=\"MansonSong\" /><ref name=\"MansonSongDebut\" /> In February 2020, [[Mark Snow]] was revealed to have composed the score for the final version of the film, though additional music composed by Walcott and Mogis was still set to be used in the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Snow\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nThe first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, on [[Friday the 13th]],<ref name=\"DeadlineTrailer\" /> with a horror focus inspired by the success of the film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', which had been released the month before.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /> Sara Vilkomerson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type of ''X-Men'' film, and was \"creepy\". Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]\";<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song.<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> Alex McLevy, writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a \"straight-up horror film\", and said, \"Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre.\"<ref name=\"AVClubTrailer\" /> Writing for [[/Film]], Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like a [[bottle episode]] for the ''X-Men'' franchise, and noted that telling a standalone story led to success for ''Deadpool''. Bui also compared the trailer's tone to ''[[Stranger Things]]'' (in which Heaton also stars as Jonathan Byers), and Braga's performance as Reyes to [[Nurse Ratched]].<ref name=\"/FilmTrailer\" /> Boone, Lee, Braga, Zaga, and Sienkiewicz promoted the film at a 2017 [[Comic Con Experience]] panel, where they also talked about their plans for future films.<ref name=\"CCXP17\" />\n\nA new trailer, incorporating the changes made to the film following Disney's acquisition of Fox, was released on January 6, 2020.<ref name=\"NewTrailerJan2020\" /> Boone sent the trailer to Sienkiewicz in December 2019, and the comic book artist praised it as \"phenomenal\". He stated that the horror elements of the film were still present in the trailer, but that it now also appeared to have been influenced by the style of Disney's Marvel Studios who he said had appeared to give the latest version of the film \"the blessings of Marvel\".<ref name=\"SienkiewiczNewTrailer\" /> Aja Romano of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] also compared the horror elements of this trailer to ''Stranger Things'', and felt the film looked like \"highly entertaining, if predictable, fun\".<ref name=\"VoxTrailer2\" /> [[io9]]'s Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the more comic-accurate superhero abilities included in the new trailer, especially Magik's, and felt that the less superhero-like elements could be what saves the film from being a \"flop\" like ''Dark Phoenix''.<ref name=\"io9Trailer2\" /> Writing about the trailer for ''[[Forbes]]'', Scott Mendelson said the film \"seems to be pretty similar in content and tone to what was always promised\", and discussed its interesting position as \"just a movie\" now that the ''X-Men'' franchise had ended and future ''New Mutants'' films were unlikely after Marvel Studios took control of mutant-based films.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer2\" />\n\nWeeks before the film's then-set April 2020 release date, Graeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' discussed several television spots released for the film. He stated that the first two, titled \"Awaken\" and \"Escape\", followed the tone and style of the previous trailers, while the third one, \"Attitude\", presented the film more like a traditional superhero film, focusing on action, quips, and superpowers. McMillan felt this was an abrupt shift in marketing given \"Attitude\" was released just one week after the other two spots and questioned whether the change in tone was to align the marketing to the film or just an attempt to boost interest in the film by reminding audiences of other popular superhero films.<ref name=\"THRSpots\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The New Mutants'' is not currently scheduled for release, though Disney is looking at potential 2020 release dates.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" /> It was originally set to be released on April 13, 2018,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> before being delayed to February 22, 2019, to avoid ''Deadpool 2'',<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> and then to August 2, 2019, to avoid ''Dark Phoenix''.<ref name=\"Jan2018ReleaseDelay\" /> It was delayed to April 3, 2020, by Disney after that studio acquired Fox,<ref name=\"May2019ReleaseDelay\" /> and then removed from Disney's schedule in March 2020 due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" />\n\n==Future==\nBoone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy.<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /> In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] would appear in the sequels, which he wanted to be \"their own distinct kind of horror movies. [The first film] is certainly the 'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie. The next one will be a completely different kind of horror movie. Our take was just go examine the horror genre through comic book movies and make each one its own distinct sort of horror film. Drawing from the big events that we love in the comics.\" He added that connections to the wider ''X-Men'' universe could be explored more in future films.<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> Boone and Lee revealed in December 2017 that they were interested in filming the first sequel in [[Brazil]] and that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would play a role in the franchise.<ref name=\"CCXP17\" />\n\nIn March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for Marvel Studios, including the New Mutants.<ref name=\"DisneyFoxDealClose\" /><ref name=\"FoxDisneyPressRelease\" /> The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".<ref name=\"FoxMarvelOnHold\" /> In March 2020, Boone stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to ''The New Mutants'' could be made now that X-Men characters were being integrated into Marvel Studios' MCU, though he still hoped that ''The New Mutants'' would be successful enough to allow a sequel to be made. Explaining his plans for the first sequel, and confirming some previously known details, Boone stated that the film would have been set in Brazil and included Antonio Banderas as Emmanuel da Costa. Karma was to be introduced as the villain of the sequel but would have joined the New Mutants by the end of the film alongside Warlock. Boone added that Emmanuel da Costa's connections to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] would have been explored and said the overall tone of the sequel would still have been inspired by Claremont and Sienkiewicz's run.<ref name=\"BooneSequelPlans\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Runtime\">{{cite web

[[Superhero film|superhero genre]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] team [[New Mutants|of the same name]] and distributed by [[20th Century Studios]]. It is intended to be an installment of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]].<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS WORDING WITHOUT NEW TALK PAGE CONSENSUS. --> The film was directed by [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]] from a screenplay by himself and Knate Lee, and stars [[Maisie Williams]], [[Anya Taylor-Joy]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Alice Braga]], [[Blu Hunt]], and [[Henry Zaga]]. In the film, a group of young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] held in a secret facility fight to save themselves.\n\nBoone and Lee first began work on the film after Boone completed ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' (2014). The pair pitched a potential film trilogy to ''X-Men'' producer [[Simon Kinberg]], and in May 2015 were officially signed on to the project. Taylor-Joy and Williams were rumored to be cast in March 2016, and were confirmed over a year later when the rest of the cast filled out. Filming took place in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], from July to September 2017, primarily at [[Medfield State Hospital]], with an April 2018 release in mind. The film was then delayed while reshoots were planned and [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|Disney began the process of acquiring production company 20th Century Fox]]. After the acquisition was completed, Boone returned to work on the film, and it was completed without reshoots in March 2020. \n\n''The New Mutants'' has had several release dates since it was first announced, and was most recently scheduled for release in the United States on April 3, 2020. Disney removed the film from its schedule in March 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] with the intention of rescheduling the film for a later 2020 date. Boone has said that original planned trilogy was unlikely to happen due to Disney's [[Marvel Studios]] gaining control of the characters.\n\n==Premise==\nFive young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" />\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maisie Williams]] as [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane]]:<br />A Scottish mutant who can turn into a wolf and is struggling to reconcile this with her religious beliefs.<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /> Williams was convinced to join the film after discussing the character's religious background with director [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]], who identified with the comic book character due to his own strict religious upbringing.<ref name=\"WilliamsSameSex\" /> \n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Illyana Rasputin / Magik]]:<br />A Russian mutant with sorcery powers,<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /> she can manifest the [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)#Soulsword|Soulsword]] and use teleportation discs to travel.<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /><ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" /> Illyana is the sister of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], a member of the X-Men seen in previous films in the series.<ref name=\"TaylorJoyWilliams\" /> Her purple dragon companion from the comic books, [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], also appears in the film.<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" />\n* [[Charlie Heaton]] as [[Cannonball (comics)|Sam Guthrie / Cannonball]]: An American mutant who can propel himself into the air, and is invulnerable while doing so.<ref name=\"Heaton\" />\n* [[Alice Braga]] as [[Cecilia Reyes]]: A mentor to the group and a medical doctor who can generate protective fields around herself.<ref name=\"Braga\" />\n* [[Blu Hunt]] as [[Danielle Moonstar|Danielle Moonstar / Mirage]]:<br />A Native American mutant who can create illusions based on the fears and desires of other people.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> The film includes a love story between Rahne and Dani which Williams felt was a natural extension of the comic book characters having a telepathic connection. Boone described this as \"the spine and focus\" of the film's \"character-driven stuff\".<ref name=\"WilliamsSameSex\" />\n* [[Henry Zaga]] as [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa / Sunspot]]: A Brazilian mutant who can manipulate solar energy.<ref name=\"Zaga\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter completing work on the 2014 film ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]], director [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]] created a comic book with his childhood best friend Knate Lee using panels from [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]'s ''[[New Mutants]]'' comics to illustrate what a potential film trilogy adapting those comics would be like. The pair had been fans of the characters growing up, with Boone calling the stories \"really dark, interesting, and different from the typical [[X-Men]] stories that we had read\". Boone and Lee took the comic to [[Simon Kinberg]], one of the producers of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], who \"really liked it\".<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /> In May 2015, Fox finalized a deal to have Boone direct ''The New Mutants'', from a script by himself and Lee, with Kinberg and [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] producing. The film would be a standalone spinoff film, expanding the universe of the ''X-Men'' franchise.<ref name=\"Announcement\" /> While working on the first draft of the script, Boone sent it and his ideas for the film to Sienkiewicz, who thought Boone \"had it figured out\" and was not just copying the comics.<ref name=\"CCXP17\" />\n\nUpdating the status of the film in March 2016, Kinberg said that Boone and Lee were working on the script, and that, like ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016), the film would be different from the core ''X-Men'' films, \"maybe not as different as ''Deadpool'', but it has its own unique, original voice to it\". Kinberg said that the film would have a [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] \"vibe\", and that there was potential for characters seen in previous films to appear, namely [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], and [[Professor X]], who all have ties to the New Mutants in the comics.<ref name=\"KinbergIGNMar2016\" /> Also at that time, it was reported that [[Maisie Williams]] and [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] were being looked at to star in the film as [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane]] and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin / Magik]], respectively. The rest of the title team was expected to consist of the characters [[Cannonball (comics)|Sam Guthrie / Cannonball]], Roberto da Costa / Sunspot, and [[Danielle Moonstar|Danielle Moonstar / Mirage]].<ref name=\"HitFixMar2016\" /> Sunspot previously appeared in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', portrayed by [[Adan Canto]], who was not confirmed to be returning for the new film.<ref name=\"Canto\" /> [[James McAvoy]], who portrayed Professor X in several previous ''X-Men'' films, was said to have a significant role in this one, alongside [[Alexandra Shipp]], who was expected to reprise her role of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] from ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"HitFixMar2016\" />\n\nIn May 2016, Kinberg confirmed that the script included Professor X, and stated his hope for filming to start at the beginning of 2017.<ref name=\"KinbergColliderMay2016\" /> By that August, the titular team's roster had expanded to include the character [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], while [[Scott Neustadter]] and [[Michael H. Weber]]\u2014who worked with Boone writing ''The Fault in Our Stars''\u2014were working on a new draft of the script while Boone and Lee were busy on another project.<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /><ref name=\"NeustadterWeber\" /> In November, the report of Williams and Taylor-Joy's casting was believed to be accurate, and [[Nat Wolff]] was being looked at for the role of Cannonball after working with Boone on ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The character [[Demon Bear]] was set as the film's main antagonist, with the project aiming for more of a \"'[[Stephen King]] meets [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]'-style horror movie\".<ref name=\"CSExclusive\" /> Boone soon noted that the Demon Bear was a very personal villain for him as a child, as he \"was raised by very religious parents. They were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptists]] and they believed in the [[rapture]]; they believed [[Satan#Christianity|the devil]] was real; they believed in [[Demon#Christianity|demons]].\"<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" /><ref name=\"BooneCS\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe film had entered pre-production in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], by April 2017, in preparation for filming to begin in that city. Location scouting took place, including at [[Medfield State Hospital]] which was previously used as a filming location for ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"PreProd\" /> Fox scheduled ''New Mutants'' for an April 13, 2018 release.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Several weeks later, the studio officially announced the casting of Taylor-Joy and Williams, and was \"making serious efforts to find ethnically appropriate actors\" for the rest of the cast, searching for South American and Native American actors to respectively play Sunspot and Moonstar. By then, McAvoy was no longer slated to appear in the film;<ref name=\"NoMcAvoyWolff\" /> Wolff was no longer in the running to portray Cannonball;<ref name=\"NoMcAvoyWolff\" /> and Karen Rosenfelt was producing alongside Kinberg,<ref name=\"TaylorJoyWilliams\" /> who ultimately spent much of production focused on making ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"TBReport\" />\n\nAt the end of May, [[Henry Zaga]] was expected to be cast as Sunspot,<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" /> and [[Rosario Dawson]]\u2014who also portrays the Marvel character [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] across the various [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix television series]]\u2014was in talks to join the film as [[Cecilia Reyes]], a mentor to the titular team. It was explained that McAvoy was no longer involved due to Professor X being written out of the script with further drafts, and Shipp's Storm had likewise been written out of the film.<ref name=\"DawsonTalks\" /> Additionally, Boone confirmed that the film would be \"a full-fledged horror movie set within the ''X-Men'' universe. There are no costumes. There are no supervillains. We're trying to do something very, very different.\"<ref name=\"BooneEWMay2017\" /> Boone had previously stated that he does not like horror films, except for \"classic ones\" such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), but was looking to \"pioneer and champion doing prestige versions of horror films\" based on his love for horror novels such as King's works.<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /> At the end of the month, [[Charlie Heaton]] was in talks to portray Cannonball.<ref name=\"Heaton\" />\n\nZaga, Dawson, and Heaton were confirmed to have been cast at the start of June,<ref name=\"Hunt\" /><ref name=\"Zaga\" /> and newcomer [[Blu Hunt]] was cast as Moonstar after an extensive and challenging international search that prioritized \"ethnic authenticity\". The character was believed to be central to the Demon Bear storyline that the film focuses on.<ref name=\"Hunt\" /> At the end of that month, Dawson exited the film, and [[Alice Braga]] was cast as Reyes in her place.<ref name=\"Braga\" /> The final shooting script for the film included contributions from Josh Zetumer, [[Chad Hayes (writer)|Chad]] and [[Carey W. Hayes|Carey Hayes]], and [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], along with a six-person \"writer's room\" that Fox hired to generate ideas for the film and also \"tear apart the script and put it back together\". Throughout the development process on the film, the script evolved from the \"full horror\" film that Boone and Lee initially wanted to make, and which Fox was resistant to, to a compromise version without \"excessive blood and scares\" and more \"young adult\"-focused.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /> Boone created storyboards with artist Ashley R. Guillory to plan out all of the shots before filming.<ref name=\"Storyboards\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 10, 2017, in Boston, under the [[working title]] ''Growing Pains''.<ref name=\"PreProd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBegan\" /><ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Peter Deming]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name=\"FilmingBegan\" /> The majority of the film was shot on location at [[Medfield State Hospital]], where Boone said every crew member had \"weird things happen to them\". Boone wanted to use practical effects as much as possible to make the film feel like the horror movies that he grew up with. For example, he had actors push on sheets of [[spandex]] to create the effect of figures pushing through the walls of a room, a technique originated by [[Wes Craven]]. Ten percent of the film used [[green screen]].<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> On the film's set, Boone explained that the script had been re-written following the failure of ''Apocalypse'' to be set during modern day rather than in the 1980s, which is why Professor X and Storm were removed from the film's story. Boone felt the film was not largely affected by this change since its confined location and lack of technology meant \"it might as well be the 80s in terms of the setting. It didn't change our story very much.\"<ref name=\"SRSetVisit\" />\n\nFox chairman and CEO [[Stacey Snider]] elaborated on the film's setting, describing it as a ''[[The Breakfast Club|Breakfast Club]]'' detention crossed with a ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|Cuckoo's Nest]]'' institution. She described the film's genre as \"a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers. We haven't seen a superhero movie whose genre is more like ''The Shining'' than {{'}}we're teenagers let's save the world.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"SniderSep2017\" /> Boone added that he was influenced by ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' (1987);<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> explained that Warlock had been deemed too expensive to portray on the film's budget, but could appear in a sequel;<ref name=\"TBReport\" /><ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> and clarified that the Demon Bear would not be the main antagonist of the film, but that character would appear and the film was \"very much inspired\" by the comic book story arc in which that character is the main villain.<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> Filming ended on September 16, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> The film's principal photography was described as \"stressful\" for Boone, who felt \"a bit neutered\" during the process due to having to tone down the film from his original \"full horror\" ideas.<ref name=\"TBReport\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Initial cut====\nRobb Sullivan served as editor for the film.<ref name=\"Sullivan\" /> Boone delivered a cut of the film to Fox that he was happy with,<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> and it tested as well as initial screenings of ''Deadpool'' did with audiences. Three days of additional photography were planned to complete the \"YA movie\" that Boone, Lee, and Fox had agreed to make. However, following the successful release of the film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' (2017), the studio cut the first trailer for ''The New Mutants'' to focus on the \"scary elements from the film, essentially selling it as a straight-up horror movie\". This proved a success, and Fox decided to make the film more like Boone's original vision rather than completing the version that they had been making during production.<ref name=\"TBReport\" />\n\n====Planned reshoots====\nIn January 2018, the film's release date was pushed back to February 22, 2019.<ref name=\"Jan2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This allowed it to avoid ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' (2018), which had just been moved to a date that would have had both films in theaters at the same time in certain markets.<ref name=\"THRReleaseDelay\" /> It also allowed time for the reshoots required to make the film more frightening.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /><ref name=\"Scarier\" /><ref name=\"Scarier2\" /> When asked about this delay the next month, Williams stated that there had been concerns during filming regarding the short turnaround from the end of photography to the previously set release date, especially with the amount of visual effects still needed to finish the film, and so in her opinion the delay was \"for the better\".<ref name=\"WilliamsDelay\" /> The additional photography was soon set for mid-2018. It was expected to include the addition of several new characters who would be appearing throughout the film rather than just making cameo appearances.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /><ref name=\"UniversePlans2018\" />\n\nFox again delayed the film's release in March 2018, moving it away from the new February 2019 release date for ''Dark Phoenix'' to August 2, 2019;<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> by then, the reshoots required for the film were believed to be more extensive than previously considered, with the studio now wanting at least half of the film to be reshot. The studio's focus was on making the film as distinct from the other entries in the series as ''Deadpool'' and ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> while avoiding the film becoming a \"flop\" like ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2015) which went through similar production issues\u2014industry insiders believed ''The New Mutants'' would not end up the same way due to Fox not blaming the issues on Boone as the studio did with ''Fantastic Four'' director [[Josh Trank]], and also because the studio was allowing Boone to write and direct the reshoots in order to complete his original vision. In addition to the reshoots changing the tone of the film, they were also set to adjust an antagonist subplot in the film: ''The New Mutants'' was originally going to feature the Essex Corporation, which was first teased at the end of ''X-Men: Apocalypse'', leading to a [[post-credits scene]] featuring the surprise reveal of [[Jon Hamm]] as the villain [[Mister Sinister]].<ref name=\"TBReport\" /> However, Fox decided against doing this following the failure of ''Apocalypse'' and so the reshoots would include a new post-credits scene introducing [[Antonio Banderas]] as Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /><ref name=\"BooneSequelPlans\" />\n\n====Disney acquisition====\nReshoots for the film were expected to begin by the end of September 2018, with Kinberg confirming that they were mostly focused on making the film more frightening after the positive response to the horror-inspired trailer. He added that \"audiences really embraced the notion of a superhero movie or a comic book movie that was, in its core, a horror film\".<ref name=\"KinbergSep2018Franchise\" /> Following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of Fox by Disney]] in March 2019, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that the planned reshoots had still not taken place and there were \"none planned so far\". The report indicated that further movement on the film appeared to be dependent on Boone,<ref name=\"THRMar2019\" /><ref name=\"THRMar2019Support\" /> and that there was a chance the film may not be released per its Fox release schedule and could instead be released on [[Disney+]] or [[Hulu]], both streaming services owned by Disney.<ref name=\"DisneyTHR\" /> A month later at [[CinemaCon]] 2019, Disney confirmed that the film was still planned but indicated that its release date could be adjusted to better fit within Disney's existing schedule.<ref name=\"CinemaCon2019\" /> A month after that, the studio pushed the film's release back to April 3, 2020,<ref name=\"May2019ReleaseDelay\" /> and the reshoots were set to take place later in 2019. Kinberg explained that the reshoots had taken so long to schedule because the creative team was still deciding what to reshoot, and because of difficulty finding time to get the cast together again due to their commitments to various television series.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2019\" />\n\nIn August 2019, Disney was said to be unimpressed with ''The New Mutants'', believing it had \"limited box office potential\".<ref name=\"FoxFlops\" /> At the end of the month, this was reported to be the studio's impression of the original cut of the film. Further work had been completed on the film since Disney acquired it to align the film with Boone's original vision, and test screenings with these changes had been positive. In addition to making the film more frightening, these changes included removing connections to the ''X-Men'' films. This was reportedly to give Disney's [[Marvel Studios]] the option to retroactively include the film in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"NoMoreXMen\" /> Sienkiewicz confirmed in December that work on the film had been taking place and that, based on a new trailer he had seen, the style of Marvel Studios appeared to have had an impact on the tone of the film.<ref name=\"SienkiewiczNewTrailer\" /> At the end of the month, Boone said the latest version of the film followed his original vision, a comment that was interpreted by some to mean no reshoots had taken place.<ref name=\"BooneJan2020\" /> In January 2020, Disney's official fan club website [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] described the film as a \"new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", a claim that was quickly picked up by fans and reporters. Soon after the claim was noticed, all mentions of the film were removed from the website. Disney later confirmed that this was an error and the film would not be part of the MCU.<ref name=\"D23\" />\n\n====Final cut====\nOn March 7, 2020, Boone stated that the film was complete.<ref name=\"BooneDone\" /> Shortly after, he explained that work on the film had halted when Disney's acquisition of Fox had begun and so no reshoots ever took place on the film, even standard pickups that had already been scheduled during initial production. At that time, around 75 percent of the film had been edited while much of the film's visual effects were also not finished. By the time the acquisition was completed, Boone had moved on and was about to begin work on a new television series, ''[[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|The Stand]]'', based on the Stephen King novel. Before he started production on that series, Disney asked Boone if he would return to finish the film.<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" />\n\nThe work required to finish the film when Boone returned involved completing the visual effects and editing alongside co-writer Lee, which took several months. Reshoots for the film could have been scheduled at that point, but Boone found that the cast had aged too much since principal photography had taken place.<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" /> He also felt it did not make sense to add the post-credit scenes of Banderas since it was unlikely that they would be able to make a sequel now that Disney owned the X-Men rights and was integrating the property into the MCU.<ref name=\"BooneSequelPlans\" /> Describing returning to the film after so long, Boone said, \"we hadn't seen it in a year. We did a bunch of things here and there that we hadn't thought about or noticed a year before.\" The visual effects that still needed to be finished included Illyana's sorceress abilities, including her [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)#Soulsword|Soulsword]] that she materializes, as well as her dragon companion [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]].<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" /> Visual effects for the film were provided by [[DNEG]], [[Method Studios]], and [[Moving Picture Company]], with Olivier Dumont serving as VFX supervisor.<ref name=\"ArtOfVFX\" /> After the film was completed, Boone reunited the cast for the first official screening in New York City, after which Williams stated, \"The movie is exactly the movie we set out to make.\"<ref name=\"BooneNoReshoots\" />\n\nDisney removed ''The New Mutants'' from its release schedule, along with several other films, on March 12, 2020, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" /> This led to multiple online commentators referring to the film as \"cursed\" and lamenting its bad luck.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"Mar2020Curse\" /><ref name=\"Mar2020Curse2\" /> Disney said it was looking to reschedule the film's release to a later 2020 date.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" />\n\n==Music==\n[[Nate Walcott]] and [[Mike Mogis]] were confirmed in December 2017 to be composing the score for the film, having worked with Boone on his previous films.<ref name=\"WalcottMogis\" /> In May 2018, [[Marilyn Manson]] announced that his [[Cover version|cover]] of the song \"[[Cry Little Sister]]\"\u2014originally written for the film ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987) by [[Gerard McMahon]]\u2014which Manson debuted during his ''[[Heaven Upside Down]]'' tour, had been recorded specifically for the ''New Mutants'' soundtrack.<ref name=\"MansonSong\" /><ref name=\"MansonSongDebut\" /> In February 2020, [[Mark Snow]] was revealed to have composed the score for the final version of the film, though additional music composed by Walcott and Mogis was still set to be used in the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Snow\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nThe first trailer for the film was released in October 2017, on [[Friday the 13th]],<ref name=\"DeadlineTrailer\" /> with a horror focus inspired by the success of the film ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', which had been released the month before.<ref name=\"TBReport\" /> Sara Vilkomerson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that trailer delivered on Boone's promise of a different type of ''X-Men'' film, and was \"creepy\". Vilkomerson also noted the trailer's use of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]\";<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> the title treatment for the film introduced in the trailer evokes the treatment used for that song.<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> Alex McLevy, writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', also felt that Boone had delivered on his promise of a \"straight-up horror film\", and said, \"Congrats to this creative team for trying something different with the superhero genre.\"<ref name=\"AVClubTrailer\" /> Writing for [[/Film]], Hoai-Tran Bui said the film looked like a [[bottle episode]] for the ''X-Men'' franchise, and noted that telling a standalone story led to success for ''Deadpool''. Bui also compared the trailer's tone to ''[[Stranger Things]]'' (in which Heaton also stars as Jonathan Byers), and Braga's performance as Reyes to [[Nurse Ratched]].<ref name=\"/FilmTrailer\" /> Boone, Lee, Braga, Zaga, and Sienkiewicz promoted the film at a 2017 [[Comic Con Experience]] panel, where they also talked about their plans for future films.<ref name=\"CCXP17\" />\n\nA new trailer, incorporating the changes made to the film following Disney's acquisition of Fox, was released on January 6, 2020.<ref name=\"NewTrailerJan2020\" /> Boone sent the trailer to Sienkiewicz in December 2019, and the comic book artist praised it as \"phenomenal\". He stated that the horror elements of the film were still present in the trailer, but that it now also appeared to have been influenced by the style of Disney's Marvel Studios who he said had appeared to give the latest version of the film \"the blessings of Marvel\".<ref name=\"SienkiewiczNewTrailer\" /> Aja Romano of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] also compared the horror elements of this trailer to ''Stranger Things'', and felt the film looked like \"highly entertaining, if predictable, fun\".<ref name=\"VoxTrailer2\" /> [[io9]]'s Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the more comic-accurate superhero abilities included in the new trailer, especially Magik's, and felt that the less superhero-like elements could be what saves the film from being a \"flop\" like ''Dark Phoenix''.<ref name=\"io9Trailer2\" /> Writing about the trailer for ''[[Forbes]]'', Scott Mendelson said the film \"seems to be pretty similar in content and tone to what was always promised\", and discussed its interesting position as \"just a movie\" now that the ''X-Men'' franchise had ended and future ''New Mutants'' films were unlikely after Marvel Studios took control of mutant-based films.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer2\" />\n\nWeeks before the film's then-set April 2020 release date, Graeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' discussed several television spots released for the film. He stated that the first two, titled \"Awaken\" and \"Escape\", followed the tone and style of the previous trailers, while the third one, \"Attitude\", presented the film more like a traditional superhero film, focusing on action, quips, and superpowers. McMillan felt this was an abrupt shift in marketing given \"Attitude\" was released just one week after the other two spots and questioned whether the change in tone was to align the marketing to the film or just an attempt to boost interest in the film by reminding audiences of other popular superhero films.<ref name=\"THRSpots\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The New Mutants'' is not currently scheduled for release, though Disney is looking at potential 2020 release dates.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" /> It was originally set to be released on April 13, 2018,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> before being delayed to February 22, 2019, to avoid ''Deadpool 2'',<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> and then to August 2, 2019, to avoid ''Dark Phoenix''.<ref name=\"Jan2018ReleaseDelay\" /> It was delayed to April 3, 2020, by Disney after that studio acquired Fox,<ref name=\"May2019ReleaseDelay\" /> and then removed from Disney's schedule in March 2020 due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Mar2020ReleaseDelay\" />\n\n==Future==\nBoone and Lee originally pitched the film to Kinberg as the first in a trilogy.<ref name=\"BooneCS\" /> In October 2017, Boone said that the characters Warlock and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] would appear in the sequels, which he wanted to be \"their own distinct kind of horror movies. [The first film] is certainly the 'rubber-reality' supernatural horror movie. The next one will be a completely different kind of horror movie. Our take was just go examine the horror genre through comic book movies and make each one its own distinct sort of horror film. Drawing from the big events that we love in the comics.\" He added that connections to the wider ''X-Men'' universe could be explored more in future films.<ref name=\"BooneIGNPostTrailer\" /> Boone and Lee revealed in December 2017 that they were interested in filming the first sequel in [[Brazil]] and that Sunspot's father Emmanuel da Costa would play a role in the franchise.<ref name=\"CCXP17\" />\n\nIn March 2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for Marvel Studios, including the New Mutants.<ref name=\"DisneyFoxDealClose\" /><ref name=\"FoxDisneyPressRelease\" /> The Marvel-based films that Fox had been developing were placed \"on hold\".<ref name=\"FoxMarvelOnHold\" /> In March 2020, Boone stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to ''The New Mutants'' could be made now that X-Men characters were being integrated into Marvel Studios' MCU, though he still hoped that ''The New Mutants'' would be successful enough to allow a sequel to be made. Explaining his plans for the first sequel, and confirming some previously known details, Boone stated that the film would have been set in Brazil and included Antonio Banderas as Emmanuel da Costa. Karma was to be introduced as the villain of the sequel but would have joined the New Mutants by the end of the film alongside Warlock. Boone added that Emmanuel da Costa's connections to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] would have been explored and said the overall tone of the sequel would still have been inspired by Claremont and Sienkiewicz's run.<ref name=\"BooneSequelPlans\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Runtime\">{{cite web

Since then, she has appeared in several critically and commercially successful films such as ''[[Fiza]]'' (2000), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'' (2003), all which garnered her critical acclaim, as well as several awards and nominations.\n\n==Career==\nJaya Bachchan, an [[Alumnus|alumna]] of the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], started her career with a supporting role in [[Satyajit Ray]]'s Bengali film, [[Mahanagar]] (1963) at the age of 15, with [[Anil Chatterjee]] and [[Madhabi Mukherjee]].

actress and politician. She is currently the [[Member of Parliament]] in [[Rajya Sabha]] from the [[Samajwadi Party]], notably serving four terms since 2004. She is recognised as one of the finest [[Hindi film]] actresses of her time, particularly known for reinforcing a naturalistic style of acting in both mainstream and \"middle-of-the-road\" cinema.<ref name=\"Gulzar, p. 457\">[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 457]]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2000/12/22/stories/09220226.htm|author=Somaaya, Bhaawana|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2000|accessdate=19 September 2011|title=His humility appears misplaced|quote=Probably the only actress to make a virtue out of simplicity, Jaya was the first whiff of realistic acting in an era when showbiz was bursting with mannequins}}</ref> During her career, she won nine [[Filmfare Awards]]: including three for [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and three for [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], which makes her the overall most-awarded performer in the female acting categories, along with [[Rani Mukerji]].

She was noted for her performances in films including ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972) and ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), among others. She appeared alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in films such as ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' (1973), ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975), ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).\n\nFollowing her marriage to actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and the birth of their children, Bachchan restricted her work in films. After her appearance in the ''[[Silsila (1981 film)|Silsila]]'' (1981), she took an indefinite sabbatical from films. She returned to acting with [[Govind Nihalani]]'s ''[[Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa]]'' in 1998. Since then, she has appeared in several critically and commercially successful films such as ''[[Fiza]]'' (2000), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'' (2003), all which garnered her critical acclaim, as well as several awards and nominations.\n\n==Career==\nJaya Bachchan, an [[Alumnus|alumna]] of the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], started her career with a supporting role in [[Satyajit Ray]]'s Bengali film, [[Mahanagar]] (1963) at the age of 15, with [[Anil Chatterjee]] and [[Madhabi Mukherjee]]. After that, she had appeared in two Bengali films: a 13-minute short film, ''Suman'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=rudraa&e=com|title=HugeDomains.com - RudRaa.com is for sale (Rud Raa)|website=www.hugedomains.com|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref> and a Bengali comedy [[Dhanyee Meye]] (1971), as [[Uttam Kumar]]'s sister-in-law.<ref name=da>[[#Da|Dawar, p. 56]]</ref>\n\nInspired by her experience with Ray, she decided to join the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] (FTII), [[Pune]] to learn acting and passed with the gold medal.<ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 526]]</ref> She was also picked out to play the eponymous role of ''Guddi'' in the 1971 [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] film, [[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]] in which she played a school girl obsessed with film star [[Dharmendra]].<ref name=ba>[[#Ba|Banerjee, p. 93]]</ref> Guddi was a success,<ref name=da/> and she moved to Bombay and soon picked other roles, however her role of a 14-year-old schoolgirl, aided by her petite looks, created the [[Girl next door|girl-next-door]] image for her, which she was often associated with through the rest of her career. Though she tried to break out of the mould with glamorous roles as in ''[[Jawani Diwani]]'', (1972)<ref name=\"Gulzar, p. 457\"/> and a negative character of the heroine faking amnesia, in ''[[Anamika (1973 film)|Anamika]]'' (1973), she was mostly recognised for roles of the sort which were credited with epitomising middle-class sensibility, which she played amiably in films of \"middle-cinema\" directors such as [[Gulzar]], [[Basu Chatterjee]] and indeed [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]].<ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 91]]</ref> These films include ''[[Uphaar]]'' (1971), ''[[Piya Ka Ghar]]'' (1972), ''[[Parichay (film)|Parichay]]'' (1972), ''[[Koshish]]'' (1972)  and ''[[Bawarchi]]'' (1972), performed with marked sensitivity.<ref name=\"ba\" /><ref>[[#Gu|Gulzar, p. 396]]</ref> By now, she was a popular star.<ref name=\"da\" />\n\nIn Gulzar's ''[[Koshish]]'' (1973), Bhaduri and [[Sanjeev Kumar]] played a deaf couple who struggle through their difficulties as handicapped people.
