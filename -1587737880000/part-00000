He had the unique distinction of starting his military career on the very bottom rung as a pre-war [[militia]] gunner before rising through the ranks to become the first Canadian commander of the [[Canadian Corps]]. Currie's success was based on his ability to rapidly adapt [[brigade]] tactics to the exigencies of [[trench warfare]], using set piece operations and bite-and-hold [[military tactics|tactics]]. He is generally considered to be among the most capable commanders of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and one of the finest commanders in [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canadian military history]].\n\nCurrie began his military career in 1897 as a part-time soldier in the Canadian militia while making his living as a teacher and later as an insurance salesman and real estate speculator. Currie rose quickly through the ranks: commissioned as an officer in 1900, promoted to captain in 1901, then major in 1906 and became an artillery regimental commander in 1909. In 1913, Currie accepted the command of the newly created 50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada. Finding himself in debt following a real estate crash in Victoria, Currie embezzled ten thousand dollars earmarked for regimental uniforms into his personal accounts to pay off his debts. When the [[First World War]] broke out [[Minister of Militia and Defence (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Militia]] [[Sam Hughes]] appointed Currie as commander of the 2nd Canadian Brigade. Following the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] Currie was promoted to [[major-general]] and commander of the [[1st Canadian Division]]. Following the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], Canadian Corps commander [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]] was promoted to general and Currie, the 1st Canadian Division commander, was promoted to [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] and assumed command of the Canadian Corps. Upon returning to Canada, Currie was promoted to [[General (Canada)|general]] and was made [[Inspector-General]] of the Canadian Army. Although he had only a high school diploma, Currie became the principal and vice-chancellor of [[McGill University]] in 1920, holding this post until his death in 1933.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Arthur Currie homestead 1919.JPG|thumb|left|The farm homestead of Arthur Currie (1919)]]\nArthur Currie was born on 5 December 1875 to William Garner Curry and Jane Patterson on their farm near the hamlet of [[Napperton, Ontario]], just west of [[Strathroy-Caradoc|Strathroy]].<ref name=odnb>{{cite web|first=A.

He had plans to pursue a professional career in law or medicine; however, the death of his father at the age of fifteen made this impossible due to his limited financial means.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} Currie instead pursued teacher training, but he was unable to secure a job and returned to high school to complete an honours certificate in order to gain university entrance.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} In May 1894, mere months before his final exams, Currie quarrelled with one of his teachers, and subsequently left high school to seek his fortune in [[British Columbia]],{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} hoping to take advantage of the financial boom resulting from the construction of the [[transcontinental railway]].{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} However, Currie found no prospects outside of teaching, so he qualified as a teacher in British Columbia and took a teaching position on the [[Saanich Peninsula]] north of [[Victoria, British Columbia]].{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} In 1896, Currie moved to Victoria, taking a position at Boy's Central School and later [[Victoria High School (British Columbia)|Victoria High School]].<ref name=odnb />{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=221}}\n\n==Early military career==\nOn 6 May 1897, Currie joined the [[Canadian Militia]] as a part-time gunner for the [[5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA|5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment]]. Currie achieved the rank of corporal in 1900 and was soon after offered an officer's commission, which would give him a much higher status in the social circles of Victoria.<ref name=TimesObit>{{cite web| title = Obituary of General Sir Arthur Currie, The (London) Times | date=1 December 1933 | url = http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/transcripts/transcriptDisplay.asp?Type=N&transNo=303 | accessdate = 15 September 2008}}</ref> A military commission was however an expensive proposition. Officers were expected to provide their own set of tailored uniforms and to donate their pay to the officer's [[mess]].{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=48}} Currie was discouraged by his financial prospects as a teacher;{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} and consequently, in February 1900, he left teaching and took a position as an insurance salesman with Matson & Coles, a local insurance firm.{{sfn|Berton|1986|p=104-105}}{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=47}} On 14 August 1901, Currie married Lucy Chaworth-Musters, who had been raised by Currie's aunt and uncle in British Columbia after being abandoned by her British military officer father following the death of her mother in childbirth.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=222}}\n\n[[File:Officers of the 5th Regiment-Macaulay Point-1909.jpg|thumb|left|Officers of the 5th Regiment at Macaulay Point in 1909, Currie seated on bench third from left]]\nCurrie took on his role as militia officer seriously.{{sfn|Urquhart|1950|p=20}} He attended every available course offered by the British Army Contingent at Work Point Barracks in [[Esquimalt]], often ordered military text books from London and was found on the shooting range every Saturday.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=221}} He was a keen marksman and was elected president of the British Columbia Rifle Association in 1905.{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=222}} Currie was promoted to captain in November 1901, and then to major in 1906.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Urquhart|1950|p=20}} By September 1909, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the 5th Regiment.{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=19}} Apart from his interest in the militia, Currie was also an active [[Freemason]], rising to the position of deputy grandmaster of the Victoria District of Freemasonry in 1907. He also served two years as president of the Young Men's Liberal Association of Victoria, and several times was suggested as a candidate for the provincial legislature.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Urquhart|1950|p=16}}\n\nIn addition to his military career, Currie continued to be active in business. He was appointed head of the Matson Insurance Firm in 1904 when Sam Matson, who had many business interests beyond his insurance firm,  decided to concentrate his energy on publishing the ''[[Daily Colonist]]''.{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=221}}{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=47}} With a land speculation boom in Victoria in full swing, Currie and a Victoria businessman, R. A. Power, formed Currie & Power in 1908. Currie invested heavily in the real estate market.{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=18}} The firm was a success until 1912 when property prices began to decline.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=17}} In 1913, Currie's financial situation deteriorated rapidly as the value of his real estate holdings decreased and he became financially over-extended.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=47}} In August, Currie's 5-year term as commander of the 5th Regiment came to a close and he faced a forced retirement from the Canadian Militia at the age of 38.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=48}}{{sfn|Humphries|2008|p=16}} At this critical juncture, he was approached to take command of a new militia regiment.\n\n[[File:Lt-Col Arthur Currie - 50th Regiment.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Currie in Highlands dress of the 50th Regiment]]\nFollowing the [[Canadian federal election of 1911]], [[Sam Hughes|Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes]] had ordered a rapid expansion of the national force.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=48}} The large number of Scottish citizens of Victoria appealed for the formation of a Highland regiment in Victoria to augment the [[88th Regiment Victoria Fusiliers]], which had been formed in 1912. On 15 August 1913, the government authorized the formation of the [[50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada]].{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=48}} The originally designated commanding officer for the new regiment failed to qualify for the post and Currie was approached as a logical replacement.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|p=9}} Currie initially turned down the idea, likely recognizing that the cost of the new Highland uniforms and mess bills would only add to his financial problems.<ref>{{cite web| last = Drysdale| first = D.M| title = Pipe Band of the 50th Regiment (Gordon Highlanders)| url = http://www.cscotrpipesanddrums.com/docs/50th_gordon_highlanders.pdf| accessdate = 15 September 2008| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081030230532/http://www.cscotrpipesanddrums.com/docs/50th_gordon_highlanders.pdf| archivedate = 30 October 2008| df = dmy-all}}</ref> His subordinate and friend, Major [[Garnet Hughes]], Sam Hughes' son, was responsible for persuading Currie to reconsider and accept the position.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=18}} Currie attended the Militia Staff Course conducted by Major [[Louis Lipsett]], future commander of the  [[3rd Canadian Division]], and qualified in March 1914.{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=24}}\n\nCurrie was desperate to avoid personal bankruptcy, which would have resulted in a loss in social standing and forced him to resign his commission.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=51}} On 31 July 1914, Currie received {{CA$|10833.34|1914|round}} from the Militia Department with which to purchase new uniforms.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=51}} Instead of using the funds to pay contractor Moore, Taggart and Co for the regimental uniforms, Currie embezzled the funds to pay off his personal debts.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=51}} The 50th Regiment's honorary colonel, William Coy, had promised to underwrite the regiment with $35,000, and Currie planned to use the funds to pay the uniform contractor.{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=245}}{{sfn|Berton|1986|p=106}} Unfortunately for Currie, Coy did not follow through with his financial commitment to the regiment, leaving Currie's accounting sleight-of-hand potentially exposed.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out and Canada found itself at war on 4 August 1914, Currie was offered command of Military District No. 11 \u2013 British Columbia.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=18}} When he turned this down, he was then offered command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]'s [[1st Canadian Division]]. Currie considered turning down this offer as well so he could attempt to solve his financial woes.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=18}} He once again changed his mind at the urging of Garnet Hughes. Currie's promotion to [[brigadier general]] was confirmed on 29 September 1914,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29086|page=2096|date=2 March 1915}}</ref> and he took command of the 2nd Brigade at the [[Valcartier Camp]] in Quebec. When the 50th Regiment's acting commanding officer, Major Cecil Roberts, wrote to him inquiring as to the status of the uniform grant, Currie ignored the correspondence and sailed overseas with his brigade in October 1914.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=51}}\n\n==World War I==\n===Brigade commander===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Ypres}}\nThe Canadian 1st Division spent the winter of 1914\u201315 training in England, and were sent to France in February 1915. After a period of indoctrination in the realities of trench warfare, they took control of a section of trench in the [[Ypres Salient]] on 17 April 1915. Only five days later, the Germans used [[poison gas]] for the first time on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552881/Battle_of_Ypres.html#p4 |title=Battles of Ypres |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030233021/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552881/Battle_of_Ypres.html#p4 |archivedate=30 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy |date= |accessdate=31 October 2009 }}</ref> French colonial troops on the Canadians' left flank broke, leaving a {{convert|7|km|adj=on}} long hole in the Allied line.<ref name=\"Duffy\">{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Michael|title=The Second Battle of Ypres, 1915|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/ypres2.htm| work=firstworldwar.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> In the chaos that followed, Currie proved his worth as a leader by assessing the situation, and coolly issuing commands from his brigade headquarters even as it was gassed and then destroyed by fire. Currie cobbled together a fluid defence and counterattacked. At one point, he personally went back to the rear to try to convince two regiments of British reinforcements to move forward.{{sfn|Cassar|2010|pp=180\u2013181}} After several days of fierce fighting, Allied counterattacks re-established a stable defensive line, denying the Germans a breakthrough.\n\nCurrie's leadership during the Second Battle of Ypres was a source of dispute by British historian [[James Edward Edmonds]], who argued that Currie and his 2nd Canadian Brigade performed poorly at Ypres. Currie, supported by the Canadian official historian Colonel Archer Fortescue Duguid, waged a vigorous defense, charging that Edmonds was seeking to diminish the Canadian contribution to the Second Battle of Ypres.{{sfn|Travers|1989|p=303}} Edmonds wrongly accused Currie of ordering his men to retreat on 24 April 1915 because of the chaos caused by the chlorine gas and fierce attacks of the German infantry; Currie and Duguid stated that it was Brigadier-General [[Richard Ernest William Turner|Richard Turner]], commanding the 3rd Canadian Brigade on Currie's left, who had ordered a retreat without orders, leaving Currie with an exposed left flank.{{sfn|Travers|1989|pp=313\u2013314}} Canadian historian Timothy Travers also argued that Edmonds was very unfair to Currie since the 1st Canadian Division occupied a position that would have been difficult to defend even under normal conditions, without considering the effects of the first mass use of poison gas and the complete withdrawal of French forces on their left flank.{{sfn|Travers|1989|p=318}} Travers maintained that unlike the Algerians who fled, Currie's 2nd Brigade held its ground at Ypres, consequently losing 46% of its total strength either killed or wounded over two days of fighting.{{sfn|Travers|1989|p=318}}\n\nFollowing the battle, Currie was promoted to [[major-general]], and given command of the entire [[First Canadian Division]]. He was also invested as a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) and as [[Legion d'Honneur|Commander of the Legion d'Honneur]].\n\n===Division commander===\n{{see also|Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Vimy Ridge}}\nAlthough the Canadians did not take part in the infamous Anglo-French [[Battle of the Somme|offensive on the Somme]] on 1 July 1916, they did eventually move into the line in the fall to aid the slow crawl forward. Currie proved himself to be the master of the set-piece assault, designed to take limited objectives and then hold on in the face of inevitable German counterattacks. It was at this time that Currie lost favour with former friends Sam and Garnet Hughes. Sam Hughes wanted Garnet promoted to command of a division, but Currie, having seen Garnet in action at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], believed Garnet to be an incompetent officer, and refused. Currie's reputation was on the rise, and Hughes did not have the necessary leverage to force Currie to comply.\n\nBy late 1916, the four Canadian divisions were in France, gathered together as the Canadian Corps under the command of Sir [[Julian Byng]]. The British High Command informed Byng that the Canadians would have a central role in the upcoming [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] by attacking Vimy Ridge, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plains.{{sfn|Brennan|2007|p=94}} Byng ordered Currie to study the Battle of the Somme and advise what lessons could be taken and applied. Currie was also among a set of officers who attended a series of lectures hosted by the French Army regarding their experiences during the [[Battle of Verdun]].{{sfn|Brennan|2007|p=94}} Currie not only questioned senior French officers but also sought out junior officers and asked the same questions, carefully noting the discrepancies between the senior officers' beliefs and the junior officers' experiences.<ref name=vimy>{{cite book| last = Berton| first = Pierre| title = Vimy| publisher = McLelland and Stewart| year = 1986| location = Toronto| pages = [https://archive.org/details/vimy0000bert/page/104 104\u2013105]| isbn = 0-7710-1339-6| url = https://archive.org/details/vimy0000bert/page/104}}</ref> On 20 January 1917, Currie began a series of well received lectures to Corps and divisional headquarters based on his research.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=250}} In response to the Verdun visit, organizational changes were made to the platoon structure within the infantry battalions that would later become Corps wide changes.{{sfn|Pugsley|2006|p=13}} In his report, Currie evaluated not only the French tactics but also what the Canadians had done wrong in the fighting around [[Pozi\u00e8res]] in 1916.{{sfn|Pugsley|2006|p=13}} Currie summarized the primary factors behind successful French offensive operations as: careful staff work, thorough artillery preparation and support, the element of surprise, and a high state of training in the infantry units detailed for the assault.{{sfn|Pugsley|2006|p=13}}\n\nCurrie, in command of the 1st Canadian Division, was responsible for the broad southern sector of the Canadian Corps advance and expected to make the greatest advance in terms of distance. The attack was to begin at 5:30&nbsp;am on [[Easter Monday]], 9 April 1917. By the end of the first day, the 1st Canadian Division had captured all of its first line objectives and the left half of its second line.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=255}}  The next morning by 9:30&nbsp;am, fresh troops had leap-frogged existing battalions to advance to the third objective line.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=179}} To permit the troops time to consolidate the third line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=257}}  Shortly before 1:00&nbsp;pm, the advance recommenced and, by 2:00&nbsp;pm, the 1st Canadian Divisions secured their final objective.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=182}}\n\n===Canadian Corps commander===\n{{See also|Battle of Hill 70|Second Battle of Passchendaele}}\n[[File:The Royal Visits To the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q5656.jpg|thumb|left|King George V conferring the honour of knighthood on Currie on 12 July 1917]]\nWhen Byng was promoted to [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] in command of the British Third Army in June 1917, Currie was raised to the temporary rank of [[lieutenant-general]] on 9 June,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30178 |supp=y|page=6956|date=10 July 1917}}</ref> and given command of the entire Canadian Corps.

To avoid news of the scandal from breaking, Currie borrowed money from two wealthy subordinates, [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]] and [[Victor Odlum]], to finally pay back the money he had taken from the 50th Regiment.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=52}}\n\nThe British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] commander Lieutenant-General [[Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne|Henry Horne]] ordered the Canadian Corps to relieve [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] opposite the city of Lens on 10 July 1917, and directed Currie to develop a plan for capturing the city by the end of July 1917.{{sfn|Granatstein|2004|pp=119\u2013120}} The operation was intended to engage as many German formations as possible and to prevent them from reinforcing the Ypres sector during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=282}} After examining the area, Currie instead proposed to take the high ground outside the city, marked on allied maps as Hill 70,{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=285}} hold the feature in the expectation of a German counterattack, and inflict casualties by preparing a zone of concentrated artillery and machine gun fire.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=698}} Currie's plan was implemented successfully, and by the end of the battle, some 20,000 Germans had been killed or wounded at the cost of 9,000 Canadians.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=698}} The operation was effective in preventing German formations from transferring local men and equipment to Ypres, and Haig believed that the [[Battle of Hill 70]] was one of the finest minor operations of the war.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=698}}\n\nThe Canadian Corps was then transferred from Lens to Ypres to take part in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. Currie was tasked with continuing the advance started by the now exhausted [[II Anzac Corps]] in order to ultimately capture Passchendaele village and gain favourable observation positions and drier winter positions. Currie submitted his provisional operational plan on 16 October and presented a plan with extensive resources made available in reserve. He estimated the attack would result in 16,000 casualties.<ref>{{cite web| last= Veterans Affairs Canada | title = The Third Battle of Ypres and Passchendaele| url = http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/firstwar/canada/Canada12 | accessdate = 16 September 2008}}</ref> Currie's preparations included reconnaissance, road construction and a massing of artillery and heavy machine guns.{{sfn|Neillands|1998|p=402}} Rather than one mass assault, Currie designed a series of well-prepared, sharp attacks that allowed the Corps to take an objective and then hold it against the inevitable German counterattacks. By 30 October, the Canadians, aided by two British divisions, gained the outskirts of the village in a driving rainstorm, and then held on for five days against intense shelling and counter-attacks, often standing waist deep in mud as they fought. The Canadians' victory came at the cost of 15,654 casualties, including 4,028 killed. Currie's grim casualty prediction had been accurate.{{sfn|Neillands|1998|p=401}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Canada's Hundred Days}}\nBy early 1918, the Canadian Corps was in a state of uncertainty. The Canadian government wanted to expand the Canadian Corps by forming a 5th Division but the BEF wanted the Canadian Corps reorganized to mirror British divisions. British command also intended to integrate American battalions into the depleted corps, which Currie predicted would be a disaster and would destroy the homogeneous structure of the corps.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|p=100}} Currie was opposed to all of those measures since he did not view them as being in the best interests of the corps.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|pp=100\u2013101}} Currie, with the aid of the [[Minister of Overseas Military Forces]], prevailed against the structural changes. The Canadian Corps retained its original Canadian organizational structure and fought as a homogeneous formation for the entire [[Hundred Days Offensive]].{{sfn|Morton|1982|p=155-179}}\n\nOn 21 March 1918, the Germans launched a major [[Spring Offensive]] hoping to force an armistice on their terms, but by the summer their forward momentum had been contained and the Allies prepared to counterattack. In August 1918, when Currie was ordered to move the corps {{convert|70|mi|km}} south to Amiens, the Canadians took pains to camouflage their move. This included sending a radio unit and two battalions to Ypres as a diversion.<ref>{{cite web|author= Kennedy Hickman|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/worldwari/p/amiens.htm| title= World War I: Battle of Amiens | accessdate = 17 September 2008}}</ref> With no preliminary artillery bombardment at Amiens to warn the Germans, the attack on 8 August was a success. The Canadians were withdrawn from the line, and moved to the Somme, where they participated in the attack on the Hindenburg Line at the [[Drocourt\u2013Qu\u00e9ant Line]] on 2 September. The assault resulted in the Germans being overrun along a {{convert|7000|yd|m|adj=on}} front.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=438}}{{failed verification|date=December 2017}} Historian Denis Winter called the seizure of the Drocourt\u2013Qu\u00e9ant line by the Canadian Corps the \"greatest single achievement\" of the British Expeditionary Force during the entire war, and praised Currie for his ability to bring \"unprecedented\" concentrations of artillery and machine gun together with flexible infantry sections that were adjusted for the situation.{{sfn|Winter|1991|pp=270\u2013271}} The [[17th Army (German Empire)|German Seventeenth Army]] then retreated behind the flooded [[Canal du Nord]]. Currie took three weeks to prepare perhaps his most audacious plan: he suggested the entire corps cross the drier section of the canal on a front of only {{convert|2700|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=212}} On 27 September, the entire corps moved across the canal as planned, and then through the German lines in a series of planned zig-zag manoeuvres designed to confuse the Germans. Exhausted and demoralized, the German army staged a controlled retreat over the next five weeks. On 10 November, in what was to be his most controversial decision, Currie, under orders to continue to advance, ordered elements of the corps to liberate [[Mons]]. On the morning of 11 November, as Currie received orders confirming there would be a general armistice at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., the capture of Mons was completed.\n\nIn December 1918, Currie established the Canadian War Narrative Section to maintain a level of control as to how the Canadian contribution to the Hundred Days Offensive would be documented in print and presented to the public.{{sfn|Cook|2006|p=35}} Tim Cook argues that the Canadian War Narrative Section was an important step in not only recording and presenting the achievements of the Canadian Corps but also in restoring Currie's damaged reputation, which had been battered by Sam Hughes and his supporters in Parliament.{{sfn|Cook|2006|p=35}} Hughes frequently referred to Currie as a butcher.\n\n==Post-war==\nCurrie and family had moved to England in 1915. They returned to Canada following the war, arriving in Halifax on 17 August 1919.{{sfn|Humphries|2008|p=325}} No band or crowd received the ship when it docked and when Currie arrived at the [[Victoria Memorial Museum Building|Victoria Memorial Building]] to greet the [[13th Canadian Parliament]] he received a lukewarm reception.{{sfn|Humphries|2008|p=325}}{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=197}} Currie was appointed Inspector-General of the Armed Forces and was then promoted to full-ranking general on 10 December, the highest ranking position in the Canadian forces. Currie intended to use the position to reform the military. However, in the post-war period, military funding was cut and Currie encountered significant opposition from the military bureaucracy to organizational changes.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|p=135}} Deeply unhappy, Currie retired from the military, and in May 1920 accepted the position of principal and vice-chancellor of [[McGill University]] in Montreal.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===McGill University===\n[[File:McGill Principal Arthur Currie ca1930.jpg|thumb|upright|Currie as the McGill University Principal in 1930]]\nCurrie had only a high school diploma, but on the recommendation of McGill's acting principal, [[Frank Dawson Adams]], Currie was selected as principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University on the basis of his \"exceptional powers of organization and administration\" and his \"capacity for inspiration and leadership\" rather than academic prowess.<ref>{{citation |title=The Canadian Annual Review of Public Affairs|first=John Castell |last=Hopkins |year=1921|publisher=Canadian Review Company |location=Toronto |page=648}}</ref> Within months of Currie's appointment, he led a fund-raising campaign to revive the university, travelling from coast to coast in a personal appeal for support;<ref>{{Citation| last   = Currie| first  = Arthur| contribution = The Influence of Canadian Universities in Canadian Development| date= 13 Oct 1920| title  = The Empire Club of Canada Addresses (Toronto, Canada)| publisher = The Empire Club of Canada| pages=344\u2013355 }}</ref> the fundraising campaign raised {{CA$|6.5 million}}, significantly more than the original goal of {{CA$|5 million}}.{{sfn|Fedunkiw|2005|pp=93, 104}} Currie made a name for himself as a premier university administrator.

He had the unique distinction of starting his military career on the very bottom rung as a pre-war [[militia]] gunner before rising through the ranks to become the first Canadian commander of the [[Canadian Corps]]. Currie's success was based on his ability to rapidly adapt [[brigade]] tactics to the exigencies of [[trench warfare]], using set piece operations and bite-and-hold [[military tactics|tactics]]. He is generally considered to be among the most capable commanders of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and one of the finest commanders in [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canadian military history]].\n\nCurrie began his military career in 1897 as a part-time soldier in the Canadian militia while making his living as a teacher and later as an insurance salesman and real estate speculator. Currie rose quickly through the ranks: commissioned as an officer in 1900, promoted to captain in 1901, then major in 1906 and became an artillery regimental commander in 1909. In 1913, Currie accepted the command of the newly created 50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada. Finding himself in debt following a real estate crash in Victoria, Currie embezzled ten thousand dollars earmarked for regimental uniforms into his personal accounts to pay off his debts. When the [[First World War]] broke out [[Minister of Militia and Defence (Canada)|Canadian Minister of Militia]] [[Sam Hughes]] appointed Currie as commander of the 2nd Canadian Brigade. Following the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] Currie was promoted to [[major-general]] and commander of the [[1st Canadian Division]]. Following the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], Canadian Corps commander [[Julian H.G. Byng, Viscount Byng of Vimy|Julian Byng]] was promoted to general and Currie, the 1st Canadian Division commander, was promoted to [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] and assumed command of the Canadian Corps. Upon returning to Canada, Currie was promoted to [[General (Canada)|general]] and was made [[Inspector-General]] of the Canadian Army. Although he had only a high school diploma, Currie became the principal and vice-chancellor of [[McGill University]] in 1920, holding this post until his death in 1933.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Arthur Currie homestead 1919.JPG|thumb|left|The farm homestead of Arthur Currie (1919)]]\nArthur Currie was born on 5 December 1875 to William Garner Curry and Jane Patterson on their farm near the hamlet of [[Napperton, Ontario]], just west of [[Strathroy-Caradoc|Strathroy]].<ref name=odnb>{{cite web|first=A.

He had plans to pursue a professional career in law or medicine; however, the death of his father at the age of fifteen made this impossible due to his limited financial means.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} Currie instead pursued teacher training, but he was unable to secure a job and returned to high school to complete an honours certificate in order to gain university entrance.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} In May 1894, mere months before his final exams, Currie quarrelled with one of his teachers, and subsequently left high school to seek his fortune in [[British Columbia]],{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} hoping to take advantage of the financial boom resulting from the construction of the [[transcontinental railway]].{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} However, Currie found no prospects outside of teaching, so he qualified as a teacher in British Columbia and took a teaching position on the [[Saanich Peninsula]] north of [[Victoria, British Columbia]].{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}} In 1896, Currie moved to Victoria, taking a position at Boy's Central School and later [[Victoria High School (British Columbia)|Victoria High School]].<ref name=odnb />{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=221}}\n\n==Early military career==\nOn 6 May 1897, Currie joined the [[Canadian Militia]] as a part-time gunner for the [[5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA|5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment]].

He was appointed head of the Matson Insurance Firm in 1904 when Sam Matson, who had many business interests beyond his insurance firm,  decided to concentrate his energy on publishing the ''[[Daily Colonist]]''.{{sfn|Bosher|2012|p=221}}{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=47}} With a land speculation boom in Victoria in full swing, Currie and a Victoria businessman, R.

Currie invested heavily in the real estate market.{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=18}} The firm was a success until 1912 when property prices began to decline.{{sfn|Sharpe|2009|p=17}} In 1913, Currie's financial situation deteriorated rapidly as the value of his real estate holdings decreased and he became financially over-extended.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=47}} In August, Currie's 5-year term as commander of the 5th Regiment came to a close and he faced a forced retirement from the Canadian Militia at the age of 38.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=48}}{{sfn|Humphries|2008|p=16}} At this critical juncture, he was approached to take command of a new militia regiment.\n\n[[File:Lt-Col Arthur Currie - 50th Regiment.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Currie in Highlands dress of the 50th Regiment]]\nFollowing the [[Canadian federal election of 1911]], [[Sam Hughes|Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes]] had ordered a rapid expansion of the national force.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=48}} The large number of Scottish citizens of Victoria appealed for the formation of a Highland regiment in Victoria to augment the [[88th Regiment Victoria Fusiliers]], which had been formed in 1912.

At one point, he personally went back to the rear to try to convince two regiments of British reinforcements to move forward.{{sfn|Cassar|2010|pp=180\u2013181}} After several days of fierce fighting, Allied counterattacks re-established a stable defensive line, denying the Germans a breakthrough.\n\nCurrie's leadership during the Second Battle of Ypres was a source of dispute by British historian [[James Edward Edmonds]], who argued that Currie and his 2nd Canadian Brigade performed poorly at Ypres. Currie, supported by the Canadian official historian Colonel Archer Fortescue Duguid, waged a vigorous defense, charging that Edmonds was seeking to diminish the Canadian contribution to the Second Battle of Ypres.{{sfn|Travers|1989|p=303}} Edmonds wrongly accused Currie of ordering his men to retreat on 24 April 1915 because of the chaos caused by the chlorine gas and fierce attacks of the German infantry; Currie and Duguid stated that it was Brigadier-General [[Richard Ernest William Turner|Richard Turner]], commanding the 3rd Canadian Brigade on Currie's left, who had ordered a retreat without orders, leaving Currie with an exposed left flank.{{sfn|Travers|1989|pp=313\u2013314}} Canadian historian Timothy Travers also argued that Edmonds was very unfair to Currie since the 1st Canadian Division occupied a position that would have been difficult to defend even under normal conditions, without considering the effects of the first mass use of poison gas and the complete withdrawal of French forces on their left flank.{{sfn|Travers|1989|p=318}} Travers maintained that unlike the Algerians who fled, Currie's 2nd Brigade held its ground at Ypres, consequently losing 46% of its total strength either killed or wounded over two days of fighting.{{sfn|Travers|1989|p=318}}\n\nFollowing the battle, Currie was promoted to [[major-general]], and given command of the entire [[First Canadian Division]]. He was also invested as a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) and as [[Legion d'Honneur|Commander of the Legion d'Honneur]].\n\n===Division commander===\n{{see also|Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Vimy Ridge}}\nAlthough the Canadians did not take part in the infamous Anglo-French [[Battle of the Somme|offensive on the Somme]] on 1 July 1916, they did eventually move into the line in the fall to aid the slow crawl forward. Currie proved himself to be the master of the set-piece assault, designed to take limited objectives and then hold on in the face of inevitable German counterattacks. It was at this time that Currie lost favour with former friends Sam and Garnet Hughes. Sam Hughes wanted Garnet promoted to command of a division, but Currie, having seen Garnet in action at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], believed Garnet to be an incompetent officer, and refused. Currie's reputation was on the rise, and Hughes did not have the necessary leverage to force Currie to comply.\n\nBy late 1916, the four Canadian divisions were in France, gathered together as the Canadian Corps under the command of Sir [[Julian Byng]]. The British High Command informed Byng that the Canadians would have a central role in the upcoming [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] by attacking Vimy Ridge, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plains.{{sfn|Brennan|2007|p=94}} Byng ordered Currie to study the Battle of the Somme and advise what lessons could be taken and applied. Currie was also among a set of officers who attended a series of lectures hosted by the French Army regarding their experiences during the [[Battle of Verdun]].{{sfn|Brennan|2007|p=94}} Currie not only questioned senior French officers but also sought out junior officers and asked the same questions, carefully noting the discrepancies between the senior officers' beliefs and the junior officers' experiences.<ref name=vimy>{{cite book| last = Berton| first = Pierre| title = Vimy| publisher = McLelland and Stewart| year = 1986| location = Toronto| pages = [https://archive.org/details/vimy0000bert/page/104 104\u2013105]| isbn = 0-7710-1339-6| url = https://archive.org/details/vimy0000bert/page/104}}</ref> On 20 January 1917, Currie began a series of well received lectures to Corps and divisional headquarters based on his research.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=250}} In response to the Verdun visit, organizational changes were made to the platoon structure within the infantry battalions that would later become Corps wide changes.{{sfn|Pugsley|2006|p=13}} In his report, Currie evaluated not only the French tactics but also what the Canadians had done wrong in the fighting around [[Pozi\u00e8res]] in 1916.{{sfn|Pugsley|2006|p=13}} Currie summarized the primary factors behind successful French offensive operations as: careful staff work, thorough artillery preparation and support, the element of surprise, and a high state of training in the infantry units detailed for the assault.{{sfn|Pugsley|2006|p=13}}\n\nCurrie, in command of the 1st Canadian Division, was responsible for the broad southern sector of the Canadian Corps advance and expected to make the greatest advance in terms of distance. The attack was to begin at 5:30&nbsp;am on [[Easter Monday]], 9 April 1917. By the end of the first day, the 1st Canadian Division had captured all of its first line objectives and the left half of its second line.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=255}}  The next morning by 9:30&nbsp;am, fresh troops had leap-frogged existing battalions to advance to the third objective line.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=179}} To permit the troops time to consolidate the third line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=257}}  Shortly before 1:00&nbsp;pm, the advance recommenced and, by 2:00&nbsp;pm, the 1st Canadian Divisions secured their final objective.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=182}}\n\n===Canadian Corps commander===\n{{See also|Battle of Hill 70|Second Battle of Passchendaele}}\n[[File:The Royal Visits To the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q5656.jpg|thumb|left|King George V conferring the honour of knighthood on Currie on 12 July 1917]]\nWhen Byng was promoted to [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] in command of the British Third Army in June 1917, Currie was raised to the temporary rank of [[lieutenant-general]] on 9 June,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30178 |supp=y|page=6956|date=10 July 1917}}</ref> and given command of the entire Canadian Corps.

To avoid news of the scandal from breaking, Currie borrowed money from two wealthy subordinates, [[David Watson (general)|David Watson]] and [[Victor Odlum]], to finally pay back the money he had taken from the 50th Regiment.{{sfn|Brown|Morton|1979|p=52}}\n\nThe British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] commander Lieutenant-General [[Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne|Henry Horne]] ordered the Canadian Corps to relieve [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] opposite the city of Lens on 10 July 1917, and directed Currie to develop a plan for capturing the city by the end of July 1917.{{sfn|Granatstein|2004|pp=119\u2013120}} The operation was intended to engage as many German formations as possible and to prevent them from reinforcing the Ypres sector during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=282}} After examining the area, Currie instead proposed to take the high ground outside the city, marked on allied maps as Hill 70,{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=285}} hold the feature in the expectation of a German counterattack, and inflict casualties by preparing a zone of concentrated artillery and machine gun fire.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=698}} Currie's plan was implemented successfully, and by the end of the battle, some 20,000 Germans had been killed or wounded at the cost of 9,000 Canadians.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=698}} The operation was effective in preventing German formations from transferring local men and equipment to Ypres, and Haig believed that the [[Battle of Hill 70]] was one of the finest minor operations of the war.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=698}}\n\nThe Canadian Corps was then transferred from Lens to Ypres to take part in the [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. Currie was tasked with continuing the advance started by the now exhausted [[II Anzac Corps]] in order to ultimately capture Passchendaele village and gain favourable observation positions and drier winter positions. Currie submitted his provisional operational plan on 16 October and presented a plan with extensive resources made available in reserve. He estimated the attack would result in 16,000 casualties.<ref>{{cite web| last= Veterans Affairs Canada | title = The Third Battle of Ypres and Passchendaele| url = http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/firstwar/canada/Canada12 | accessdate = 16 September 2008}}</ref> Currie's preparations included reconnaissance, road construction and a massing of artillery and heavy machine guns.{{sfn|Neillands|1998|p=402}} Rather than one mass assault, Currie designed a series of well-prepared, sharp attacks that allowed the Corps to take an objective and then hold it against the inevitable German counterattacks. By 30 October, the Canadians, aided by two British divisions, gained the outskirts of the village in a driving rainstorm, and then held on for five days against intense shelling and counter-attacks, often standing waist deep in mud as they fought. The Canadians' victory came at the cost of 15,654 casualties, including 4,028 killed. Currie's grim casualty prediction had been accurate.{{sfn|Neillands|1998|p=401}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Canada's Hundred Days}}\nBy early 1918, the Canadian Corps was in a state of uncertainty. The Canadian government wanted to expand the Canadian Corps by forming a 5th Division but the BEF wanted the Canadian Corps reorganized to mirror British divisions. British command also intended to integrate American battalions into the depleted corps, which Currie predicted would be a disaster and would destroy the homogeneous structure of the corps.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|p=100}} Currie was opposed to all of those measures since he did not view them as being in the best interests of the corps.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|pp=100\u2013101}} Currie, with the aid of the [[Minister of Overseas Military Forces]], prevailed against the structural changes. The Canadian Corps retained its original Canadian organizational structure and fought as a homogeneous formation for the entire [[Hundred Days Offensive]].{{sfn|Morton|1982|p=155-179}}\n\nOn 21 March 1918, the Germans launched a major [[Spring Offensive]] hoping to force an armistice on their terms, but by the summer their forward momentum had been contained and the Allies prepared to counterattack. In August 1918, when Currie was ordered to move the corps {{convert|70|mi|km}} south to Amiens, the Canadians took pains to camouflage their move. This included sending a radio unit and two battalions to Ypres as a diversion.<ref>{{cite web|author= Kennedy Hickman|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/worldwari/p/amiens.htm| title= World War I: Battle of Amiens | accessdate = 17 September 2008}}</ref> With no preliminary artillery bombardment at Amiens to warn the Germans, the attack on 8 August was a success. The Canadians were withdrawn from the line, and moved to the Somme, where they participated in the attack on the Hindenburg Line at the [[Drocourt\u2013Qu\u00e9ant Line]] on 2 September. The assault resulted in the Germans being overrun along a {{convert|7000|yd|m|adj=on}} front.{{sfn|Nicholson|1962|p=438}}{{failed verification|date=December 2017}} Historian Denis Winter called the seizure of the Drocourt\u2013Qu\u00e9ant line by the Canadian Corps the \"greatest single achievement\" of the British Expeditionary Force during the entire war, and praised Currie for his ability to bring \"unprecedented\" concentrations of artillery and machine gun together with flexible infantry sections that were adjusted for the situation.{{sfn|Winter|1991|pp=270\u2013271}} The [[17th Army (German Empire)|German Seventeenth Army]] then retreated behind the flooded [[Canal du Nord]]. Currie took three weeks to prepare perhaps his most audacious plan: he suggested the entire corps cross the drier section of the canal on a front of only {{convert|2700|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Farr|2007|p=212}} On 27 September, the entire corps moved across the canal as planned, and then through the German lines in a series of planned zig-zag manoeuvres designed to confuse the Germans. Exhausted and demoralized, the German army staged a controlled retreat over the next five weeks. On 10 November, in what was to be his most controversial decision, Currie, under orders to continue to advance, ordered elements of the corps to liberate [[Mons]]. On the morning of 11 November, as Currie received orders confirming there would be a general armistice at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., the capture of Mons was completed.\n\nIn December 1918, Currie established the Canadian War Narrative Section to maintain a level of control as to how the Canadian contribution to the Hundred Days Offensive would be documented in print and presented to the public.{{sfn|Cook|2006|p=35}} Tim Cook argues that the Canadian War Narrative Section was an important step in not only recording and presenting the achievements of the Canadian Corps but also in restoring Currie's damaged reputation, which had been battered by Sam Hughes and his supporters in Parliament.{{sfn|Cook|2006|p=35}} Hughes frequently referred to Currie as a butcher.\n\n==Post-war==\nCurrie and family had moved to England in 1915. They returned to Canada following the war, arriving in Halifax on 17 August 1919.{{sfn|Humphries|2008|p=325}} No band or crowd received the ship when it docked and when Currie arrived at the [[Victoria Memorial Museum Building|Victoria Memorial Building]] to greet the [[13th Canadian Parliament]] he received a lukewarm reception.{{sfn|Humphries|2008|p=325}}{{sfn|Dancocks|1985|p=197}} Currie was appointed Inspector-General of the Armed Forces and was then promoted to full-ranking general on 10 December, the highest ranking position in the Canadian forces. Currie intended to use the position to reform the military. However, in the post-war period, military funding was cut and Currie encountered significant opposition from the military bureaucracy to organizational changes.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|p=135}} Deeply unhappy, Currie retired from the military, and in May 1920 accepted the position of principal and vice-chancellor of [[McGill University]] in Montreal.{{sfn|Hyatt|1987|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===McGill University===\n[[File:McGill Principal Arthur Currie ca1930.jpg|thumb|upright|Currie as the McGill University Principal in 1930]]\nCurrie had only a high school diploma, but on the recommendation of McGill's acting principal, [[Frank Dawson Adams]], Currie was selected as principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University on the basis of his \"exceptional powers of organization and administration\" and his \"capacity for inspiration and leadership\" rather than academic prowess.<ref>{{citation |title=The Canadian Annual Review of Public Affairs|first=John Castell |last=Hopkins |year=1921|publisher=Canadian Review Company |location=Toronto |page=648}}</ref> Within months of Currie's appointment, he led a fund-raising campaign to revive the university, travelling from coast to coast in a personal appeal for support;<ref>{{Citation| last   = Currie| first  = Arthur| contribution = The Influence of Canadian Universities in Canadian Development| date= 13 Oct 1920| title  = The Empire Club of Canada Addresses (Toronto, Canada)| publisher = The Empire Club of Canada| pages=344\u2013355 }}</ref> the fundraising campaign raised {{CA$|6.5 million}}, significantly more than the original goal of {{CA$|5 million}}.{{sfn|Fedunkiw|2005|pp=93, 104}} Currie made a name for himself as a premier university administrator.

Although physically a large man, standing over six feet tall, Currie did not cut a heroic military figure. Nor was he a charismatic speaker. Described as aloof by his troops, who called him \"Guts and Gaiters,\" he nevertheless inspired them. He was a brilliant tactician who used his skills to reduce casualties and is credited with accelerating the end of the war. According to historian Jack Hyatt, \"His slogan was, 'Pay the price of victory in shells\u2014not lives,' and if he did anything heroic it was that.\"<ref>{{cite news | title =Remembering Arthur Currie: Canadian War Hero | newspaper =CTV News | publisher =CTVGlobemedia  | date = 2007-04-04 | url =http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/fr/1812233/posts | access-date = 2016-02-19}}</ref> Currie's leadership of the Canadian Corps was described in an article in ''[[Maclean's]]'': \"No flashing genius, but a capable administrator, cool headed and even tempered and sound of judgment. He has surrounded himself with a capable staff whose counsel he shares and whose advice he takes. He is the last man in the world to stick to his own plan if a better one offers.

Clark, first founded Texas Christian University. The Clarks were scholar-preacher/teachers associated with the [[Restoration Movement]]. These early leaders of the Restoration Movement were the spiritual ancestors of the modern [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], as well as major proponents of education.\n[[File:Campustcu.JPG|thumb|Part of TCU's Campus]]\nFollowing their return from service in the Civil War, brothers Addison and Randolph established a children's preparatory school in Fort Worth. This school, known as the Male & Female Seminary of Fort Worth, operated from 1869 to 1874. Both Clarks nourished a vision for an institution of higher education that would be Christian in character, but non-sectarian in spirit and intellectually open-minded. They purchased five blocks of land in downtown Fort Worth in 1869 for that purpose.\n\nBut from 1867 to 1872, the character of Fort Worth changed substantially due to the commercial influence of the [[Chisholm Trail]], the principal route for moving Texas cattle to the Kansas rail heads. A huge influx of cattle, men, and money transformed the sleepy frontier village into a booming, brawling cowtown. The area around the property purchased by the Clarks for their college soon became the town's vice district, an unrelieved stretch of saloons, gambling halls, dance parlors, and bawdy houses catering to the rough tastes of the Chisholm Trail cowboys. Its rough and rowdy reputation had, by 1872, acquired it the nickname of \"Hell's Half Acre\" (the heart of which is today occupied by the Fort Worth Convention Center and the [[Fort Worth Water Gardens]]).\n[[File:Rainy Day in front of Sadler.jpg|thumb|Sadler, TCU's Administrative Building]]\nThe Clarks feared that this negative environment undermined the fledgling university's mission. They began to look for an alternative site for their college, and they found it at [[Granbury micropolitan area#Communities|Thorp Spring]], a small community and stagecoach stop {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} in [[Hood County, Texas|Hood County]] to the southwest near the frontier of [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] territory.\n\n===Move to Thorp Spring, 1873\u20131895===\n[[File:Thorp Campus.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Thorp Spring, Texas, campus.]]\nIn 1873 the Clark brothers moved South to Thorp Spring and founded Add-Ran Male & Female College.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog2/ThorpSpringHistory.htm |title=High Hopes & Human Frailties |first=Barbara |last=Thorp Wilkins |work=Granbury!

This was a progressive step at a time when only 15% of the national college enrollment was female and almost all were enrolled at women's colleges.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAt Thorp Spring the fledgling college expanded quickly. The inaugural enrollment in Fall 1873 was 13 students, though this number rose to 123 by the end of the first term. Shortly thereafter, annual enrollment ranged from 200 to 400. At one time more than 100 counties of Texas were represented in the student body. The Clark brothers also recruited prestigious professors from all over the South to join them at Thorp Spring. The standards of the school and the efficiency of its work came to be recognized throughout the United States, and many graduates were welcomed at universities throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog/ClarkRandolph.htm|title=Randolph Clark|website=Granburydepot.org|accessdate=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625054205/http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog/ClarkRandolph.htm|archive-date=June 25, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Add-Ran College formed an official partnership with what would become the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. This relationship with the church was a partnership of heritage and values, though the church never enjoyed any administrative role at TCU. Later that year the Clark brothers handed over all land, buildings, and assets and allowed the growing university to continue as a private institution; their only compensation was a request that their descendants should have free tuition (though this stipulation was never enforced).\n\nIn keeping with the transition, in 1889 the school was renamed '''Add-Ran Christian University''', though by this time it had quite outgrown the property.\n\n===Move to Waco, roots of rivalry, 1895\u20131910===\nThe need for a larger population and transportation base prompted the university to relocate to [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] from 1895 to 1910; it purchased the campus of the defunct [[Waco Female College]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Terri Jo |last=Ryan |url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/waco_history/looking-back-at-waco-female-college-during-women-s-history/article_b1e6a272-75f8-5bdf-8045-14fd1d996dd6.html |title=Looking Back at Waco Female College During Women\u2019s History Month |newspaper=Waco Tribune-Herald |date=March 15, 2014 |access-date=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117105008/https://www.wacotrib.com/news/waco_history/looking-back-at-waco-female-college-during-women-s-history/article_b1e6a272-75f8-5bdf-8045-14fd1d996dd6.html |archive-date=November 17, 2018 |url-status=live }} Revised as: {{cite web |url=http://wacohistory.org/items/show/121 |title=Waco Female College |website=Waco History |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307045307/http://wacohistory.org/items/show/121 |archive-date=March 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The institution was renamed Texas Christian University in 1902, though almost immediately it was dubbed as its acronym TCU. It was during this 15-year sojourn in Waco that TCU in 1896 entered the ranks of intercollegiate football and adopted its school colors of purple and white, as well as its distinctive Horned Frog mascot. This also laid the groundwork for the rivalry between TCU and cross-town school in Waco, [[Baylor University]]. \"The Revivalry\" - as the rivalry is known on both sides - is the most even rivalry in collegiate football at any level, with the series currently led by TCU 55\u201352\u20137, and with neither school ever enjoying more than an eight-game win streak; TCU won the eight consecutive games from 1964 to 1971 and Baylor won eight consecutive from 1974 from 1981.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Return to Fort Worth, 1910\u2013present===\n[[File:TCU Campus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Early image of the TCU campus in Fort Worth.]]\nIn 1910 a fire of unknown origin destroyed the university's Main Administration building. A rebuilding project was planned, but before reconstruction could begin, a group of enterprising [[Fort Worth]] businessmen offered the university $200,000 in rebuilding money ($5,114,505.00 in 2018 currency) and a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus as an inducement to return to Fort Worth. This move brought TCU home to the source of its institutional roots and completed its 40-year transition from a frontier college to an urban university.\n[[File:Commons Rainy Day.jpg|thumb|TCU Today]]\nThe TCU campus at its present location in Fort Worth in 1910\u201311 consisted of four buildings: Clark Hall and Goode Hall, the men's dormitories; Jarvis Hall, the women's dormitory; and the Main Administration building (now Reed Hall). [[File:Texas Christian University Administration Building, Fort Worth, TX.jpg|thumb|Administration Building (Postcard, circa 1911\u20131924)]]  Two of these four original buildings still remain: Reed Hall (originally the Main Administration building) and Jarvis Hall (originally a women's dormitory, but since renovated as an administrative building). Goode Hall was demolished in 1958 and replaced by the new Clark Hall, originally a men's dormitory. It was renovated in 2008 as a coed residence hall. The original Clark Hall was demolished in 1959 and replaced by Sadler Hall, the current main administration building.\n[[File:Jarvis Hall.jpg|thumb|right|225px|TCU students inside a dorm room at Jarvis Hall.]]\nThe university received its first and a huge charitable endowment in 1923, from [[Mary Couts Burnett]], the recent widow of [[Samuel Burk Burnett]], a legendary rancher, banker, and oilman. Married in 1892, Mary Couts came to believe that her husband was trying to kill her and she sought a divorce. Instead, Burk Burnett had his wife committed to a mental asylum, where she struggled for more than 10 years to regain her freedom. With the help of her physician, she eventually succeeded and was released in 1922, only to find that her husband had recently died and left her nothing.\n\nShe challenged the will and eventually secured half of her late husband's estate ($4 million, worth $80.3 million in 2018 currency). The long years of incarceration had taken a toll on Couts Burnett and people worried about her health. In her 1923 will, she bequeathed her entire estate, including a half-interest in the gigantic 6666 (\"Four Sixes\") Ranch, to TCU. She died in 1924, and about 100 female students from TCU attended her funeral in honor of her gift. She lived long enough to see construction begin on the TCU building that today bears her name, the Mary Couts Burnett Library.<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbuad BURNETT, MARY COUTS | The Handbook of Texas Online| Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710080412/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbuad |date=2011-07-10 }}.

Clark Field was moved to the west of the Library. Since their first season of play in 1896, the [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU football team]] had gained increasing attention and success every year and joined the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1923. In 1928 the school received a generous gift from local newspaper magnate and philanthropist [[Amon G. Carter]], and in 1930 the school opened [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]], where the TCU football team still plays.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:TCU Jarvis Hall.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Jarvis Hall]]\nTCU's campus sits on {{convert|272|acre|km2}} of developed campus (325 acres total) which is located four miles (6.5&nbsp;km) from [[downtown Fort Worth]].\n[[File:Sophomore Dorms.jpg|thumb|Modernity at TCU]]\nThe TCU campus is divided into roughly three areas: a residential area, an academic area, and Worth Hills. The two main areas of campus, the residential and academic areas, are separated by University Drive, an oak-lined street that bisects the campus. Residence halls, the Student Union, and the Campus Commons are all located to the West of University Drive, while the library, chapel, and most academic buildings are located to the East of it. All of TCU's surrounding streets are lined by [[live oaks]].\n\n[[File:TCU Snow.jpg|thumb|Snow over TCU]]\nA third area of campus, known as Worth Hills, lies to the west across Stadium Drive and adjacent to the football stadium. Worth Hills is home to all of the university's fraternity and sorority houses, though plans to move all Greek housing to a new location have been underway for several years.\n\nRoughly half of TCU undergraduate students live on campus.<ref>[http://www.admissions.tcu.edu/faq.asp?act=answer&id=38 TCUAdmission | Freshman | Frequently Asked Questions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609203323/http://www.admissions.tcu.edu/faq.asp?act=answer&id=38 |date=June 9, 2010 }}.

Most of the buildings at TCU are constructed with a specially blended golden brick tabbed by brick suppliers as \"TCU buff.\" Nearly all of the buildings feature red-tile roofs, while the oldest buildings on campus, including Jarvis Hall, Sadler Hall, and the Bailey Building, are supported by columns of various styles.\n\n[[File:Scharbauer Building Rainy Day.jpg|thumb|Rainy Day at TCU]]\nA notable exception to this rule is Robert Carr Chapel, which was the first building on campus to be constructed of bricks other than TCU buff. The chapel is built of a distinctive salmon-colored brick, a deviation that caused alumni to protest when the building opened in 1953.\n\nTCU is home to the Starpoint School, a laboratory school for students in grades 1\u20136 with learning differences. Starpoint's goal is to develop advanced educational techniques for helping students with [[learning disabilities]]. KinderFrogs School, an early-intervention laboratory pre-school for children with [[Down syndrome]], is housed in the same building as Starpoint. TCU is the only university in the nation with two on-campus laboratory schools in special education. The laboratory schools, both programs of the College of Education, are located near Sherley Hall and Colby Hall.\n\nSince 2006, much of the campus has been under construction, and many buildings have been either renovated or replaced. The old Student Center was demolished in 2008 and replaced with Scharbauer Hall, which opened in 2010 and houses the bulk of AddRan College's offices and classrooms. Construction is also currently underway to renovate the dance building, and a new academic building for Brite Divinity School is being erected behind the Religion Complex.<!--Need to add years to construction projects, rather than \"recently\", \"currently\" --> A major renovation of the library and a new residence hall are also planned.

For most of its history (1923\u20131996), TCU was a member of the now defunct [[Southwest Conference]] (SWC). Prior to joining the Big XII in 2012, TCU spent seven years in the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC) (2005\u20132011), where they were the only school to join from a conference other than the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC), having come from [[Conference USA]] (C-USA), of which they were a member from 2001 to 2005. Before joining C-USA, TCU teams competed in the WAC for five years, from 1996 to 2001, after the SWC dissolved.\n\nTCU's varsity sports have a long and storied history of excellence, boasting eight men's and ten women's varsity squads. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, swimming & diving, track & field, cross country and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, volleyball, golf, swimming & diving, cross country, track & field, soccer, rifle, equestrian, and tennis.\n\nIn recent years the university has made significant upgrades to its athletics facilities, including construction of the $13 million Abe-Martin Academic Enhancement Center, which was completed in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gofrogs.cstv.com/facilities/tcu-facilities-meyer.html#History |title=Texas Christian University Horned Frogs \u2013 Official Athletic Site \u2013 Facilities |publisher=Gofrogs.cstv.com |date= |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903041735/http://gofrogs.cstv.com/facilities/tcu-facilities-meyer.html#History |archive-date=September 3, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The university finished reconstruction of the entire Amon G.

Carter Stadium]]. [[Gary Patterson]] has coached the team since December 2000, leading the Horned Frogs to a 97\u201328 record (.776), including six bowl wins in 10 appearances. Under Patterson, the Horned Frogs have owned the No. 1 ranked defense in the country five times (2000, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010), the most top defenses by any team since the NCAA began keeping records in 1937 ([[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] have each had four No. 1 defensive rankings since 1937).\n\nTCU finished the [[2010 TCU Horned Frogs football team|2010 season]] as the consensus No. 2 ranked team in the nation after beating the [[Wisconsin Badgers]] in the [[2011 Rose Bowl]].

Since TCU joined Baylor in the Big 12 in 2012, the Big 12 series record is 4\u20132 in favor of TCU.\n\nThe [[TCU Horned Frogs]] also share a historic rivalry with the [[SMU Mustangs|Southern Methodist University Mustangs]], located in Fort Worth's sister (and rival) city, [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. In football, teams from TCU and SMU have competed annually in the [[Battle for the Iron Skillet]] since 1946 when, during pre-game festivities, an SMU fan was frying [[frog leg|Frog Legs]] as a joke before the game. A TCU fan, seeing this as a desecration of their \"Horned Frog\", told him that eating the frog legs was going well beyond the rivalry and that they should let the game decide who would get the skillet and the frog legs. SMU won the game, and the skillet and frog legs went to SMU that year. The tradition spilled over into the actual game and the Iron Skillet is now passed to the winner as the rivalry's traveling trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smu.edu/News/2013/SMUvsTCU-26sept2013|title=The Battle for the Iron Skillet|work=smu.edu|access-date=2016-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530192632/http://www.smu.edu/News/2013/SMUvsTCU-26sept2013|archive-date=2016-05-30|url-status=live}}</ref> TCU leads the all-time series 47\u201340\u20137. SMU recently beat TCU 41-38 on September 21, 2019.\n\nTraditionally, TCU's other biggest rivals were also members of the now-defunct [[Southwest Conference]] which disbanded in 1996. These rivalries, played only sporadically after 1996 as out of conference games, were renewed when TCU moved to the [[Big 12 Conference]] for the 2012 season. After a couple of decades of membership in various other conferences around the U.S. ([[Western Athletic Conference]], [[Conference USA]], the [[Mountain West Conference]] and the [[Big East Conference]]), TCU now plays regularly with these rivals that, along with Baylor University and Southern Methodist University discussed above, also include [[TCU\u2013Texas Tech football rivalry|The West Texas Championship]] with [[Texas Tech University]] and a long-standing rivalry with [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].\n\nTCU has also developed new rivalries. [[West Virginia University]] has become a rival largely due to the schools' cohort entry into the Big 12 Conference together in 2012, combined with a toggle of extremely close, dramatic, last-minute wins in their football match ups to date. The rivalry with [[Boise State University]], with which TCU competed on the national stage in the 2000s as the two most prominent [[BCS Buster|\"BCS Busters\"]], and which also shared one year together as members of the Mountain West Conference, has also become a major, if periodic, rival. TCU and Boise State competed as the most effective BCS Busters before the demise of the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] system. In 2011, as members of the Mountain West, TCU won the only in-conference game between the two schools, winning with no time left on a missed Boise State field goal. The rivalry with Boise State will be played only sporadically in the future due to TCU's move to the [[Power Five conferences|\"Power Conference\"]] Big 12 and Boise State's remaining status as the consensus leader of the \"mid-major\" programs in the [[Group of Five conferences|\"Group of Five\" Conferences]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nTCU also maintains a well-attended, cross-town baseball rivalry with fellow Division I competitor [[The University of Texas at Arlington]].\n\n==Notable faculty==\n*[[Stanley Block]], Ph.D., CFA, Emeritus Professor of Finance\n*[[Steven E.

Clark, first founded Texas Christian University. The Clarks were scholar-preacher/teachers associated with the [[Restoration Movement]]. These early leaders of the Restoration Movement were the spiritual ancestors of the modern [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]], as well as major proponents of education.\n[[File:Campustcu.JPG|thumb|Part of TCU's Campus]]\nFollowing their return from service in the Civil War, brothers Addison and Randolph established a children's preparatory school in Fort Worth. This school, known as the Male & Female Seminary of Fort Worth, operated from 1869 to 1874. Both Clarks nourished a vision for an institution of higher education that would be Christian in character, but non-sectarian in spirit and intellectually open-minded. They purchased five blocks of land in downtown Fort Worth in 1869 for that purpose.\n\nBut from 1867 to 1872, the character of Fort Worth changed substantially due to the commercial influence of the [[Chisholm Trail]], the principal route for moving Texas cattle to the Kansas rail heads. A huge influx of cattle, men, and money transformed the sleepy frontier village into a booming, brawling cowtown. The area around the property purchased by the Clarks for their college soon became the town's vice district, an unrelieved stretch of saloons, gambling halls, dance parlors, and bawdy houses catering to the rough tastes of the Chisholm Trail cowboys. Its rough and rowdy reputation had, by 1872, acquired it the nickname of \"Hell's Half Acre\" (the heart of which is today occupied by the Fort Worth Convention Center and the [[Fort Worth Water Gardens]]).\n[[File:Rainy Day in front of Sadler.jpg|thumb|Sadler, TCU's Administrative Building]]\nThe Clarks feared that this negative environment undermined the fledgling university's mission. They began to look for an alternative site for their college, and they found it at [[Granbury micropolitan area#Communities|Thorp Spring]], a small community and stagecoach stop {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} in [[Hood County, Texas|Hood County]] to the southwest near the frontier of [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] territory.\n\n===Move to Thorp Spring, 1873\u20131895===\n[[File:Thorp Campus.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Thorp Spring, Texas, campus.]]\nIn 1873 the Clark brothers moved South to Thorp Spring and founded Add-Ran Male & Female College.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog2/ThorpSpringHistory.htm |title=High Hopes & Human Frailties |first=Barbara |last=Thorp Wilkins |work=Granbury!

This was a progressive step at a time when only 15% of the national college enrollment was female and almost all were enrolled at women's colleges.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAt Thorp Spring the fledgling college expanded quickly. The inaugural enrollment in Fall 1873 was 13 students, though this number rose to 123 by the end of the first term. Shortly thereafter, annual enrollment ranged from 200 to 400. At one time more than 100 counties of Texas were represented in the student body. The Clark brothers also recruited prestigious professors from all over the South to join them at Thorp Spring. The standards of the school and the efficiency of its work came to be recognized throughout the United States, and many graduates were welcomed at universities throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog/ClarkRandolph.htm|title=Randolph Clark|website=Granburydepot.org|accessdate=August 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625054205/http://www.granburydepot.org/z/biog/ClarkRandolph.htm|archive-date=June 25, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Add-Ran College formed an official partnership with what would become the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. This relationship with the church was a partnership of heritage and values, though the church never enjoyed any administrative role at TCU. Later that year the Clark brothers handed over all land, buildings, and assets and allowed the growing university to continue as a private institution; their only compensation was a request that their descendants should have free tuition (though this stipulation was never enforced).\n\nIn keeping with the transition, in 1889 the school was renamed '''Add-Ran Christian University''', though by this time it had quite outgrown the property.\n\n===Move to Waco, roots of rivalry, 1895\u20131910===\nThe need for a larger population and transportation base prompted the university to relocate to [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] from 1895 to 1910; it purchased the campus of the defunct [[Waco Female College]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Terri Jo |last=Ryan |url=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/waco_history/looking-back-at-waco-female-college-during-women-s-history/article_b1e6a272-75f8-5bdf-8045-14fd1d996dd6.html |title=Looking Back at Waco Female College During Women\u2019s History Month |newspaper=Waco Tribune-Herald |date=March 15, 2014 |access-date=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117105008/https://www.wacotrib.com/news/waco_history/looking-back-at-waco-female-college-during-women-s-history/article_b1e6a272-75f8-5bdf-8045-14fd1d996dd6.html |archive-date=November 17, 2018 |url-status=live }} Revised as: {{cite web |url=http://wacohistory.org/items/show/121 |title=Waco Female College |website=Waco History |accessdate=March 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307045307/http://wacohistory.org/items/show/121 |archive-date=March 7, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The institution was renamed Texas Christian University in 1902, though almost immediately it was dubbed as its acronym TCU. It was during this 15-year sojourn in Waco that TCU in 1896 entered the ranks of intercollegiate football and adopted its school colors of purple and white, as well as its distinctive Horned Frog mascot. This also laid the groundwork for the rivalry between TCU and cross-town school in Waco, [[Baylor University]]. \"The Revivalry\" - as the rivalry is known on both sides - is the most even rivalry in collegiate football at any level, with the series currently led by TCU 55\u201352\u20137, and with neither school ever enjoying more than an eight-game win streak; TCU won the eight consecutive games from 1964 to 1971 and Baylor won eight consecutive from 1974 from 1981.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Return to Fort Worth, 1910\u2013present===\n[[File:TCU Campus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Early image of the TCU campus in Fort Worth.]]\nIn 1910 a fire of unknown origin destroyed the university's Main Administration building. A rebuilding project was planned, but before reconstruction could begin, a group of enterprising [[Fort Worth]] businessmen offered the university $200,000 in rebuilding money ($5,114,505.00 in 2018 currency) and a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus as an inducement to return to Fort Worth. This move brought TCU home to the source of its institutional roots and completed its 40-year transition from a frontier college to an urban university.\n[[File:Commons Rainy Day.jpg|thumb|TCU Today]]\nThe TCU campus at its present location in Fort Worth in 1910\u201311 consisted of four buildings: Clark Hall and Goode Hall, the men's dormitories; Jarvis Hall, the women's dormitory; and the Main Administration building (now Reed Hall). [[File:Texas Christian University Administration Building, Fort Worth, TX.jpg|thumb|Administration Building (Postcard, circa 1911\u20131924)]]  Two of these four original buildings still remain: Reed Hall (originally the Main Administration building) and Jarvis Hall (originally a women's dormitory, but since renovated as an administrative building). Goode Hall was demolished in 1958 and replaced by the new Clark Hall, originally a men's dormitory. It was renovated in 2008 as a coed residence hall. The original Clark Hall was demolished in 1959 and replaced by Sadler Hall, the current main administration building.\n[[File:Jarvis Hall.jpg|thumb|right|225px|TCU students inside a dorm room at Jarvis Hall.]]\nThe university received its first and a huge charitable endowment in 1923, from [[Mary Couts Burnett]], the recent widow of [[Samuel Burk Burnett]], a legendary rancher, banker, and oilman. Married in 1892, Mary Couts came to believe that her husband was trying to kill her and she sought a divorce. Instead, Burk Burnett had his wife committed to a mental asylum, where she struggled for more than 10 years to regain her freedom. With the help of her physician, she eventually succeeded and was released in 1922, only to find that her husband had recently died and left her nothing.\n\nShe challenged the will and eventually secured half of her late husband's estate ($4 million, worth $80.3 million in 2018 currency). The long years of incarceration had taken a toll on Couts Burnett and people worried about her health. In her 1923 will, she bequeathed her entire estate, including a half-interest in the gigantic 6666 (\"Four Sixes\") Ranch, to TCU. She died in 1924, and about 100 female students from TCU attended her funeral in honor of her gift. She lived long enough to see construction begin on the TCU building that today bears her name, the Mary Couts Burnett Library.<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbuad BURNETT, MARY COUTS | The Handbook of Texas Online| Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710080412/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbuad |date=2011-07-10 }}.

Clark Field was moved to the west of the Library. Since their first season of play in 1896, the [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU football team]] had gained increasing attention and success every year and joined the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1923. In 1928 the school received a generous gift from local newspaper magnate and philanthropist [[Amon G. Carter]], and in 1930 the school opened [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]], where the TCU football team still plays.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:TCU Jarvis Hall.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Jarvis Hall]]\nTCU's campus sits on {{convert|272|acre|km2}} of developed campus (325 acres total) which is located four miles (6.5&nbsp;km) from [[downtown Fort Worth]].\n[[File:Sophomore Dorms.jpg|thumb|Modernity at TCU]]\nThe TCU campus is divided into roughly three areas: a residential area, an academic area, and Worth Hills. The two main areas of campus, the residential and academic areas, are separated by University Drive, an oak-lined street that bisects the campus. Residence halls, the Student Union, and the Campus Commons are all located to the West of University Drive, while the library, chapel, and most academic buildings are located to the East of it. All of TCU's surrounding streets are lined by [[live oaks]].\n\n[[File:TCU Snow.jpg|thumb|Snow over TCU]]\nA third area of campus, known as Worth Hills, lies to the west across Stadium Drive and adjacent to the football stadium.

Most of the buildings at TCU are constructed with a specially blended golden brick tabbed by brick suppliers as \"TCU buff.\" Nearly all of the buildings feature red-tile roofs, while the oldest buildings on campus, including Jarvis Hall, Sadler Hall, and the Bailey Building, are supported by columns of various styles.\n\n[[File:Scharbauer Building Rainy Day.jpg|thumb|Rainy Day at TCU]]\nA notable exception to this rule is Robert Carr Chapel, which was the first building on campus to be constructed of bricks other than TCU buff. The chapel is built of a distinctive salmon-colored brick, a deviation that caused alumni to protest when the building opened in 1953.\n\nTCU is home to the Starpoint School, a laboratory school for students in grades 1\u20136 with learning differences. Starpoint's goal is to develop advanced educational techniques for helping students with [[learning disabilities]]. KinderFrogs School, an early-intervention laboratory pre-school for children with [[Down syndrome]], is housed in the same building as Starpoint. TCU is the only university in the nation with two on-campus laboratory schools in special education. The laboratory schools, both programs of the College of Education, are located near Sherley Hall and Colby Hall.\n\nSince 2006, much of the campus has been under construction, and many buildings have been either renovated or replaced. The old Student Center was demolished in 2008 and replaced with Scharbauer Hall, which opened in 2010 and houses the bulk of AddRan College's offices and classrooms. Construction is also currently underway to renovate the dance building, and a new academic building for Brite Divinity School is being erected behind the Religion Complex.<!--Need to add years to construction projects, rather than \"recently\", \"currently\" --> A major renovation of the library and a new residence hall are also planned.

For most of its history (1923\u20131996), TCU was a member of the now defunct [[Southwest Conference]] (SWC). Prior to joining the Big XII in 2012, TCU spent seven years in the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC) (2005\u20132011), where they were the only school to join from a conference other than the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC), having come from [[Conference USA]] (C-USA), of which they were a member from 2001 to 2005. Before joining C-USA, TCU teams competed in the WAC for five years, from 1996 to 2001, after the SWC dissolved.\n\nTCU's varsity sports have a long and storied history of excellence, boasting eight men's and ten women's varsity squads. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, swimming & diving, track & field, cross country and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, volleyball, golf, swimming & diving, cross country, track & field, soccer, rifle, equestrian, and tennis.\n\nIn recent years the university has made significant upgrades to its athletics facilities, including construction of the $13 million Abe-Martin Academic Enhancement Center, which was completed in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gofrogs.cstv.com/facilities/tcu-facilities-meyer.html#History |title=Texas Christian University Horned Frogs \u2013 Official Athletic Site \u2013 Facilities |publisher=Gofrogs.cstv.com |date= |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903041735/http://gofrogs.cstv.com/facilities/tcu-facilities-meyer.html#History |archive-date=September 3, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The university finished reconstruction of the entire Amon G.

Since TCU joined Baylor in the Big 12 in 2012, the Big 12 series record is 4\u20132 in favor of TCU.\n\nThe [[TCU Horned Frogs]] also share a historic rivalry with the [[SMU Mustangs|Southern Methodist University Mustangs]], located in Fort Worth's sister (and rival) city, [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. In football, teams from TCU and SMU have competed annually in the [[Battle for the Iron Skillet]] since 1946 when, during pre-game festivities, an SMU fan was frying [[frog leg|Frog Legs]] as a joke before the game. A TCU fan, seeing this as a desecration of their \"Horned Frog\", told him that eating the frog legs was going well beyond the rivalry and that they should let the game decide who would get the skillet and the frog legs. SMU won the game, and the skillet and frog legs went to SMU that year. The tradition spilled over into the actual game and the Iron Skillet is now passed to the winner as the rivalry's traveling trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smu.edu/News/2013/SMUvsTCU-26sept2013|title=The Battle for the Iron Skillet|work=smu.edu|access-date=2016-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530192632/http://www.smu.edu/News/2013/SMUvsTCU-26sept2013|archive-date=2016-05-30|url-status=live}}</ref> TCU leads the all-time series 47\u201340\u20137. SMU recently beat TCU 41-38 on September 21, 2019.\n\nTraditionally, TCU's other biggest rivals were also members of the now-defunct [[Southwest Conference]] which disbanded in 1996. These rivalries, played only sporadically after 1996 as out of conference games, were renewed when TCU moved to the [[Big 12 Conference]] for the 2012 season. After a couple of decades of membership in various other conferences around the U.S. ([[Western Athletic Conference]], [[Conference USA]], the [[Mountain West Conference]] and the [[Big East Conference]]), TCU now plays regularly with these rivals that, along with Baylor University and Southern Methodist University discussed above, also include [[TCU\u2013Texas Tech football rivalry|The West Texas Championship]] with [[Texas Tech University]] and a long-standing rivalry with [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].\n\nTCU has also developed new rivalries. [[West Virginia University]] has become a rival largely due to the schools' cohort entry into the Big 12 Conference together in 2012, combined with a toggle of extremely close, dramatic, last-minute wins in their football match ups to date. The rivalry with [[Boise State University]], with which TCU competed on the national stage in the 2000s as the two most prominent [[BCS Buster|\"BCS Busters\"]], and which also shared one year together as members of the Mountain West Conference, has also become a major, if periodic, rival. TCU and Boise State competed as the most effective BCS Busters before the demise of the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] system. In 2011, as members of the Mountain West, TCU won the only in-conference game between the two schools, winning with no time left on a missed Boise State field goal. The rivalry with Boise State will be played only sporadically in the future due to TCU's move to the [[Power Five conferences|\"Power Conference\"]] Big 12 and Boise State's remaining status as the consensus leader of the \"mid-major\" programs in the [[Group of Five conferences|\"Group of Five\" Conferences]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nTCU also maintains a well-attended, cross-town baseball rivalry with fellow Division I competitor [[The University of Texas at Arlington]].\n\n==Notable faculty==\n*[[Stanley Block]], Ph.D., CFA, Emeritus Professor of Finance\n*[[Steven E.

JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.{{sfn|Galbraith|2012|p=202}} The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population\u2014{{as of|2012}} about half are under the age of 30\u2014and the popularity of Japanese ''[[manga]]'' series, such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' and ''[[One Piece]]''.

That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition.\"{{sfn|TalkAsia 2012}}</blockquote> Then Rakuten\u2013MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: <blockquote>\"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia.\"{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2011\u20132012: Formation ===\n{{External media\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMexRrjqvw4 First live performance of JKT48].

JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.{{sfn|Galbraith|2012|p=202}} The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population\u2014{{as of|2012}} about half are under the age of 30\u2014and the popularity of Japanese ''[[manga]]'' series, such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' and ''[[One Piece]]''.

That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition.\"{{sfn|TalkAsia 2012}}</blockquote> Then Rakuten\u2013MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: <blockquote>\"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia.\"{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2011\u20132012: Formation ===\n{{External media\n| align  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMexRrjqvw4 First live performance of JKT48].

Production order, not airing order, is used here. --> episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth<!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --> season]] of the American [[animated]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on July 8, 2010. In the episode, [[Amy Wong]] and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] fall in love and begin a culturally taboo \"robosexual\" relationship.  After facing anti-robosexual sentiments from society, they elect to get married and advocate to legalize robosexual marriage through \"Proposition Infinity\".\n\nThe episode was written by [[Michael Rowe]] and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson.  \"Proposition Infinity\" served as a satire of the controversy over [[same-sex marriage]] and [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] (generally referred to as \"Proposition 8\"), which banned same-sex marriage in California in November 2008.  The title of the episode is derived from Proposition 8, turning the 8 sideways to create the symbol for [[infinity]] (\u221e), hence \"Proposition \u221e\".  Though the episode satirizes arguments for same-sex marriage, it leans favorably toward the idea of allowing same-sex marriage.  The theme of the episode revisits the social taboo of robosexual relationships presented in earlier episodes \"[[Space Pilot 3000]]\" and \"[[I Dated a Robot]]\".  Openly gay actor [[George Takei]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' fame, who married his partner in California during the debate over Proposition 8, returns as a guest star in the series.\n\n\"Proposition Infinity\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Co-creator [[David X. Cohen]] named it as one of his favorite episodes of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile bailing [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] out of jail after he was arrested for vandalism, [[Amy Wong|Amy]] flirts with several inmates. Infuriated at her obsession with \"bad boys\", [[Kif Kroker|Kif]] breaks up with her. The break-up severely upsets Amy, and to make her feel better, [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], and Bender take her to [[Planet Hollywood|Forbidden Planet Hollywood]]. Bender mocks Amy all night, insulting and infuriating her, but this leads the two to have sex because of her interest in \"bad boys\". After this, Amy and Bender discover a mutual attraction for each other and enter into a \"robosexual\" relationship, which is taboo in the 31st century.  Because it is frowned upon, they keep quiet about their relationship, even to their friends and co-workers. The co-workers grow suspicious, but think little of it.\n\nHowever, during a mission, Amy and Bender are discovered cuddling together. [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] immediately disapproves of this, but the rest of the crew accepts Bender and Amy's relationship.  The couple is thankful, since Amy knows that her family would disapprove. However, the Professor immediately informs [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Leo and Inez Wong|Amy's parents]] and then calls [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Reverend Lionel Preacherbot|Reverend Preacherbot]] to deal with Bender, who is sent to a [[ex-gay movement|robosexual rehabilitation camp]]. While at her parents' ranch, where her parents continuously introduce her to non-robot suitors, Amy is saved by Fry, who poses as her new non-robot beau to get her parents off her back. The crew then rescues Bender from the rehabilitation camp. At the Planet Express building, Bender proposes to Amy. The Professor reminds them that robosexual marriage is illegal in New New York. To fight against this, Bender and Amy launch a campaign for the legalization of robosexual marriage.\n\nThey launch \"Proposition Infinity\" (\"Proposition \u221e\") which, in days before the election, slumps in the polls. Amy loses hope, but Bender says that they will win due to his upcoming debate against Professor Farnsworth, the leader of the Proposition Infinity opposition. At the debate (moderated by the head of [[George Takei]]) Bender gives a heartfelt speech, which the audience applauds. The Professor follows with his rebuttal, relaying a story from his past where he was in love with a fellow scientist named Eunice whom he later discovered in bed with a robot, breaking his heart. Because of this, the Professor hates robosexuals.  This does not impress the audience.  Frustrated by the audience's lack of sympathy for his cause, he accidentally admits that Eunice was actually a robot.  Having suppressed the truth for so long, Farnsworth reveals that the robot's name was actually Unit 47 and that he caught her in bed with another robot.  With his heart broken, he takes his anger out on other robosexuals. After admitting the truth, the Professor withdraws his argument, now fully in support of Proposition Infinity. The next day the proposition is approved. Amy is ecstatic, but Bender quickly dumps her when he realizes marriage means that he must be [[monogamous]]. Amy is dejected, but Kif wins back her heart by adopting a bad boy persona and the two ride off together on a motorcycle.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Crystal Chesney-Thompson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Crystal Chesney-Thompson directed the episode.|alt=Photo of Crystal Chesney-Thompson]]\nThe episode was inspired by the controversy that arose from [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] in the United States during 2008 and was written by [[Michael Rowe]].<ref name=\"CohenTVSquad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/06/23/david-x-cohen-on-futuramas-new-season/|title=David X.

Production order, not airing order, is used here. --> episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth<!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --> season]] of the American [[animated]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on July 8, 2010. In the episode, [[Amy Wong]] and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] fall in love and begin a culturally taboo \"robosexual\" relationship.  After facing anti-robosexual sentiments from society, they elect to get married and advocate to legalize robosexual marriage through \"Proposition Infinity\".\n\nThe episode was written by [[Michael Rowe]] and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson.  \"Proposition Infinity\" served as a satire of the controversy over [[same-sex marriage]] and [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] (generally referred to as \"Proposition 8\"), which banned same-sex marriage in California in November 2008.  The title of the episode is derived from Proposition 8, turning the 8 sideways to create the symbol for [[infinity]] (\u221e), hence \"Proposition \u221e\".  Though the episode satirizes arguments for same-sex marriage, it leans favorably toward the idea of allowing same-sex marriage.  The theme of the episode revisits the social taboo of robosexual relationships presented in earlier episodes \"[[Space Pilot 3000]]\" and \"[[I Dated a Robot]]\".  Openly gay actor [[George Takei]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' fame, who married his partner in California during the debate over Proposition 8, returns as a guest star in the series.\n\n\"Proposition Infinity\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Co-creator [[David X. Cohen]] named it as one of his favorite episodes of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile bailing [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] out of jail after he was arrested for vandalism, [[Amy Wong|Amy]] flirts with several inmates. Infuriated at her obsession with \"bad boys\", [[Kif Kroker|Kif]] breaks up with her. The break-up severely upsets Amy, and to make her feel better, [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]], and Bender take her to [[Planet Hollywood|Forbidden Planet Hollywood]]. Bender mocks Amy all night, insulting and infuriating her, but this leads the two to have sex because of her interest in \"bad boys\". After this, Amy and Bender discover a mutual attraction for each other and enter into a \"robosexual\" relationship, which is taboo in the 31st century.  Because it is frowned upon, they keep quiet about their relationship, even to their friends and co-workers. The co-workers grow suspicious, but think little of it.\n\nHowever, during a mission, Amy and Bender are discovered cuddling together. [[Professor Hubert Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] immediately disapproves of this, but the rest of the crew accepts Bender and Amy's relationship.  The couple is thankful, since Amy knows that her family would disapprove. However, the Professor immediately informs [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Leo and Inez Wong|Amy's parents]] and then calls [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Reverend Lionel Preacherbot|Reverend Preacherbot]] to deal with Bender, who is sent to a [[ex-gay movement|robosexual rehabilitation camp]]. While at her parents' ranch, where her parents continuously introduce her to non-robot suitors, Amy is saved by Fry, who poses as her new non-robot beau to get her parents off her back. The crew then rescues Bender from the rehabilitation camp. At the Planet Express building, Bender proposes to Amy. The Professor reminds them that robosexual marriage is illegal in New New York. To fight against this, Bender and Amy launch a campaign for the legalization of robosexual marriage.\n\nThey launch \"Proposition Infinity\" (\"Proposition \u221e\") which, in days before the election, slumps in the polls. Amy loses hope, but Bender says that they will win due to his upcoming debate against Professor Farnsworth, the leader of the Proposition Infinity opposition. At the debate (moderated by the head of [[George Takei]]) Bender gives a heartfelt speech, which the audience applauds. The Professor follows with his rebuttal, relaying a story from his past where he was in love with a fellow scientist named Eunice whom he later discovered in bed with a robot, breaking his heart. Because of this, the Professor hates robosexuals.  This does not impress the audience.  Frustrated by the audience's lack of sympathy for his cause, he accidentally admits that Eunice was actually a robot.  Having suppressed the truth for so long, Farnsworth reveals that the robot's name was actually Unit 47 and that he caught her in bed with another robot.  With his heart broken, he takes his anger out on other robosexuals. After admitting the truth, the Professor withdraws his argument, now fully in support of Proposition Infinity. The next day the proposition is approved. Amy is ecstatic, but Bender quickly dumps her when he realizes marriage means that he must be [[monogamous]]. Amy is dejected, but Kif wins back her heart by adopting a bad boy persona and the two ride off together on a motorcycle.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Crystal Chesney-Thompson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Crystal Chesney-Thompson directed the episode.|alt=Photo of Crystal Chesney-Thompson]]\nThe episode was inspired by the controversy that arose from [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] in the United States during 2008 and was written by [[Michael Rowe]].<ref name=\"CohenTVSquad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/06/23/david-x-cohen-on-futuramas-new-season/|title=David X.

Today, the university's 703-acre [[Campus of the University of Washington|main Seattle campus]] is in the [[University District, Seattle|University District]] above the [[Montlake Cut]], within the urban [[Puget Sound region]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]].  The university has additional campuses in [[University of Washington Tacoma|Tacoma]] and [[University of Washington Bothell|Bothell]]. Overall, UW encompasses over 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with over 26 university libraries, as well as the [[UW Tower]], lecture halls, art centers, museums, laboratories, stadiums, and conference centers. The university offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees through 140 departments in various colleges and schools, sees about 46,000 in total student enrollment every year, and functions on a quarter system.\n\nWashington is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] and classified as an [[Research I university|R1 Doctoral Research University]] classification under the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]]. It is cited as a leading university in the world for scientific performance and research output by the ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'' and the [[CWTS Leiden Ranking]].

Prominent Seattle-area residents, including [[Methodist]] preacher [[Daniel Bagley]], saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige. Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools. At the time, [[Arthur A. Denny]], an early founder of Seattle and member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] to Seattle. However, Bagley eventually convinced Denny that the establishment of a university would assist more in the development of Seattle's economy. Two universities were initially chartered, but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in [[Lewis County, Washington|Lewis County]] provided that locally donated land was available. When no site emerged, Denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider Seattle as a location in 1858.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kuow.org/post/founding-university-washington-one-student-time |title=Founding The University Of Washington, One Student At A Time |last=Banel |first=Feliks |date=October 8, 2012 |website=KUOW.org |publisher=[[KUOW-FM]] |accessdate=December 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101194300/http://kuow.org/post/founding-university-washington-one-student-time |archive-date=January 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Territorial University students, Seattle, 1864 (PEISER 89).jpeg|thumb|Territorial University students in 1864]]\nIn 1861, scouting began for an appropriate {{convert|10|acre|ha|0}} site in Seattle to serve as a new university campus.

The legislature passed articles incorporating the University, and establishing its Board of Regents in 1862. The school initially struggled, closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage. Washington successfully awarded its first graduate [[Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt]] in 1876, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in science.\n\n===19th century relocation===\nBy the time [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] entered the [[United States|Union]] in 1889, both Seattle and the University had grown substantially. Washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students, and the campus's relative isolation in downtown Seattle faced encroaching development. A special legislative committee, headed by UW graduate [[Edmond Meany]], was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty. The committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown Seattle]] called [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union Bay]], which was the land of the [[Duwamish people|Duwamish]], and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction. In 1895, the University relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built [[Denny Hall]]. The University Regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, eventually settling with leasing the area. This would later become one of the University's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day Seattle, generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]]. The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the [[Fairmont Olympic Hotel]].\n\nThe sole-surviving remnants of Washington's first building are four {{convert|24|ft|adj=on}}, white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns. They were salvaged by [[Edmond S. Meany]], one of the University's first graduates and former head of its history department. Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed the columns as \"Loyalty,\" \"Industry,\" \"Faith\", and \"Efficiency\", or \"LIFE.\" The columns now stand in the [[Sylvan Grove Theater and Columns|Sylvan Grove Theater]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The University of Washington's Early Years |title=No Finer Site: The University of Washington's Early Years On Union Bay |chapterurl=http://www.lib.washington.edu/specialcollections/collections/exhibits/site/early |work=University Libraries |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition - Rainier Vista.jpg|thumb|Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition on the UW campus toward [[Mount Rainier]] in 1909]]\n\n===20th century expansion===\nOrganizers of the 1909 [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their [[World's Fair|world's fair]]. They came to an agreement with Washington's [[Board of Regents]] that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition, surrounding today's [[Drumheller Fountain]] facing towards [[Mount Rainier]]. In exchange, organizers agreed Washington would take over the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion. This arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several new buildings, prepared in part by [[John Charles Olmsted]]. The plan was later incorporated into the overall UW campus master plan, permanently affecting the campus layout.\n\n[[File:Geyser Basin, University of Washington campus, Seattle, 1919 (COBB 350).jpeg|thumb|Geyser Basin at the University of Washington, 1919]]\nBoth [[World War]]s brought the military to campus, with certain facilities temporarily lent to the federal government.

Construction of the [[Liberal Arts Quadrangle]], known to students as \"The Quad,\" began in 1916 and continued to 1939. The University's architectural centerpiece, [[Suzzallo Library]], was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935. After [[World War II]], further growth came with the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]]. Among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the [[University of Washington School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] in 1946, now consistently ranked as the top [[medical school]] in the United States. It would eventually also led to the [[University of Washington Medical Center]], ranked by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' to be among the top ten hospitals in the nation.\n\n[[File:Uwaerial1922.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of campus, circa 1922.]]\n\nDuring this era, many [[Japanese Americans]] were sent away to [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] along the west coast, as part of [[Executive Order 9066]] following the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]]. Many Japanese American students and \"soon-to-be\" graduates were unable to receive diplomas, or be recognized for accomplishments at the University, until Washington's commemoration ceremony for the Japanese Americans entitled [[The Long Journey Home (ceremonial event)|The Long Journey Home]], in May 2008.\n\nFrom 1958\u20131973, the University of Washington saw tremendous growth in students, faculties, operating budget, and prestige under the leadership of [[Charles Odegaard]]. UW student enrollment had more than doubled to 34,000 as the [[post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] generation came of age. However, this era was also marked by high levels of [[student activism]], as was the case at many American universities. Much of the unrest focused around [[civil rights]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/BSU_intro.htm|title=The Black Student Union at UW: Black Power on Campus|publisher=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007071347/http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/BSU_intro.htm|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml|title=Student Activism at UW, 1948\u20131970|last=Kindig|first=Jesse|publisher=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424200237/http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to anti-Vietnam War protests by the late 1960s, the University Safety and Security Division became the University of Washington Police Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/admin/police/about/history.html|title=UW Police Department: History|accessdate=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101112410/http://www.washington.edu/admin/police/about/history.html|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOdegaard instituted a vision of building a \"community of scholars\", convincing the Washington State legislatures to increase their investments towards the University.

Prominent Seattle-area residents, including [[Methodist]] preacher [[Daniel Bagley]], saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige. Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools. At the time, [[Arthur A. Denny]], an early founder of Seattle and member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] to Seattle. However, Bagley eventually convinced Denny that the establishment of a university would assist more in the development of Seattle's economy.

The legislature passed articles incorporating the University, and establishing its Board of Regents in 1862. The school initially struggled, closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage. Washington successfully awarded its first graduate [[Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt]] in 1876, with a [[bachelor's degree]] in science.\n\n===19th century relocation===\nBy the time [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] entered the [[United States|Union]] in 1889, both Seattle and the University had grown substantially. Washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students, and the campus's relative isolation in downtown Seattle faced encroaching development. A special legislative committee, headed by UW graduate [[Edmond Meany]], was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty. The committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown Seattle]] called [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union Bay]], which was the land of the [[Duwamish people|Duwamish]], and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction. In 1895, the University relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built [[Denny Hall]]. The University Regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, eventually settling with leasing the area. This would later become one of the University's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day Seattle, generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]]. The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the [[Fairmont Olympic Hotel]].\n\nThe sole-surviving remnants of Washington's first building are four {{convert|24|ft|adj=on}}, white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns. They were salvaged by [[Edmond S. Meany]], one of the University's first graduates and former head of its history department. Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed the columns as \"Loyalty,\" \"Industry,\" \"Faith\", and \"Efficiency\", or \"LIFE.\" The columns now stand in the [[Sylvan Grove Theater and Columns|Sylvan Grove Theater]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The University of Washington's Early Years |title=No Finer Site: The University of Washington's Early Years On Union Bay |chapterurl=http://www.lib.washington.edu/specialcollections/collections/exhibits/site/early |work=University Libraries |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=April 29, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition - Rainier Vista.jpg|thumb|Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition on the UW campus toward [[Mount Rainier]] in 1909]]\n\n===20th century expansion===\nOrganizers of the 1909 [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their [[World's Fair|world's fair]]. They came to an agreement with Washington's [[Board of Regents]] that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition, surrounding today's [[Drumheller Fountain]] facing towards [[Mount Rainier]]. In exchange, organizers agreed Washington would take over the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion. This arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several new buildings, prepared in part by [[John Charles Olmsted]]. The plan was later incorporated into the overall UW campus master plan, permanently affecting the campus layout.\n\n[[File:Geyser Basin, University of Washington campus, Seattle, 1919 (COBB 350).jpeg|thumb|Geyser Basin at the University of Washington, 1919]]\nBoth [[World War]]s brought the military to campus, with certain facilities temporarily lent to the federal government.

Construction of the [[Liberal Arts Quadrangle]], known to students as \"The Quad,\" began in 1916 and continued to 1939. The University's architectural centerpiece, [[Suzzallo Library]], was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935. After [[World War II]], further growth came with the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]]. Among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the [[University of Washington School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] in 1946, now consistently ranked as the top [[medical school]] in the United States. It would eventually also led to the [[University of Washington Medical Center]], ranked by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' to be among the top ten hospitals in the nation.\n\n[[File:Uwaerial1922.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of campus, circa 1922.]]\n\nDuring this era, many [[Japanese Americans]] were sent away to [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] along the west coast, as part of [[Executive Order 9066]] following the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]]. Many Japanese American students and \"soon-to-be\" graduates were unable to receive diplomas, or be recognized for accomplishments at the University, until Washington's commemoration ceremony for the Japanese Americans entitled [[The Long Journey Home (ceremonial event)|The Long Journey Home]], in May 2008.\n\nFrom 1958\u20131973, the University of Washington saw tremendous growth in students, faculties, operating budget, and prestige under the leadership of [[Charles Odegaard]]. UW student enrollment had more than doubled to 34,000 as the [[post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] generation came of age. However, this era was also marked by high levels of [[student activism]], as was the case at many American universities. Much of the unrest focused around [[civil rights]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/BSU_intro.htm|title=The Black Student Union at UW: Black Power on Campus|publisher=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007071347/http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/BSU_intro.htm|archive-date=October 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml|title=Student Activism at UW, 1948\u20131970|last=Kindig|first=Jesse|publisher=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|access-date=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424200237/http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_student.shtml|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to anti-Vietnam War protests by the late 1960s, the University Safety and Security Division became the University of Washington Police Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/admin/police/about/history.html|title=UW Police Department: History|accessdate=August 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101112410/http://www.washington.edu/admin/police/about/history.html|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOdegaard instituted a vision of building a \"community of scholars\", convincing the Washington State legislatures to increase their investments towards the University.

It is an award-winning publication, and it is the second-largest daily paper in Seattle. ''The Daily'' is published every day classes are in session during fall, winter and spring quarters, and weekly during summer quarters. In 2010, ''The Daily'' launched a half-hour weekly television magazine show, \"The Daily's Double Shot,\" on [[UWTV]] Channel 27. The UW continues to use its proprietary [[UWTV]] channel, online and printed publications.<ref name=\"UWTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uwtv.org/|title=UWTV|date=|publisher=UWTV|accessdate=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609230447/http://www.uwtv.org/|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The faculty also produce their own publications for students and alumni.\n\n===University support===\nUW offers many services for its students and alumni, beyond the standard offered by most colleges and universities.

Despite this, growing faculty and student count has strained the regional housing supply as well as transportation facilities. Starting in 2012, UW began taking active measures to explore, plan and enact a series of campus policies to manage the annual growth. In addition to new buildings, parking and [[light rail]] stations, new building construction and renovations have been scheduled to take place through 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpd.uw.edu/campus-master-plan|title=Campus Master Plan {{!}} Capital Planning and Development|website=cpd.uw.edu|language=en|access-date=August 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802040435/https://cpd.uw.edu/campus-master-plan|archive-date=August 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The plan includes the construction of three six-story [[residence hall]]s and two apartment complexes in the west section of campus, near the existing [[Terry and Lander Halls]], in Phase I, the renovation of six existing residence halls in Phase II, and additional new construction in Phase III. The projects will result in a net gain of approximately 2,400 beds. The Residence Hall Student Association (student government for the halls) is the second-largest student organization on campus and helps plan fun events in the halls. For students, faculty, and staff looking to live off-campus, they may also explore Off-Campus Housing Affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housing.asuw.org/|title=Off-Campus Housing Affairs |publisher=ASUW |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215084410/http://housing.asuw.org/|archivedate=December 15, 2004|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Greek System at UW has also been a prominent part of student culture for more than 115 years. It is made up of two organizational bodies, the [[Interfraternity Council]] (IFC) and the Panhellenic Association.  The IFC looks over 34 fraternities with 1900+ members and Panhellenic consists of 19 sororities and 1900 members. The school has additional Greek organizations that do not offer housing and are primarily special interest.\n\n====Disability resources====\nIn addition to the University of Washington's Disability Resources for Students (DRS) office, there is also a campus-wide [[The DO-IT Center|DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center]] program that assists educational institutions to fully integrate all students, including those with disabilities, into academic life. DO-IT includes a variety of initiatives, such as the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]], and provides information on the 'universal' design of educational facilities for students of all levels of physical and mental ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ud.html|title=Universal Design: Process, Principles, and Applications|date=June 14, 2012|publisher=Washington.edu|accessdate=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428030609/http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ud.html|archive-date=April 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> These design programs aim to reduce systemic barriers which could otherwise hinder the performance of some students, and may also be applied to other professional organizations and conferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/CUDE/app_project.html|title=Applications of Universal Design to Projects, Conference Exhibits, Presentations, and Professional Organizations|date=|publisher=Washington.edu|accessdate=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531051627/http://www.washington.edu/doit/CUDE/app_project.html|archive-date=May 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Washington Huskies}}\nUW students, sports teams, and alumni are called [[Washington Huskies]], and often referred to [[Metonymy|metonymically]] as \"Montlake,\" due to the campus's location on Montlake Boulevard N.E.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/thiel/300600_thiel22.html|title=Mora's move generates intrigue|last1=Thiel|first1=Art|date=January 21, 2007|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=September 16, 2010}}</ref> (although the traditional bounds of the [[Montlake, Seattle, Washington|Montlake neighborhood]] do not extend north of the [[Montlake Cut]] to include the campus.)

Beyond its current student body, the university has more than 105,000 alumni across the country and around the world.\n\nYoungstown State provides an extensive number of student life programs. Students can participate in over 100 clubs and organizations, ranging from student government, fraternities and sororities, recreational sports programs, and student media organizations such as [[Student Newspaper|The Jambar]]. Collectively known as the [[Youngstown State Penguins|Penguins]], Youngstown State's athletic teams compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]].

In 1955, Youngstown College was renamed as '''Youngstown University''', an indication of the school's broadening curriculum.(note: A private for profit Youngstown College was formed in 1987 and had no affiliation with YSU. The college closed its doors in mid 2000 due to financial issues.<ref name=\"vindy-10-14-07\"/>)\n\nOn September 1, 1967, after becoming a public institution, Youngstown University became officially known as Youngstown State University.<ref name=\"vindy-10-14-07\"/>  The following spring, YSU opened a Graduate School and College of Applied Science and Technology.

Although it is not located near any outstanding geographical features, that has not stopped Youngstown State's campus from being noted for its landscaping, which is dissimilar from that of many other urban universities. YSU's geographical center has a park-like atmosphere, featuring a rather-hilly terrain and a variety of trees and plant life, as well as tables and chairs that surround a campus fountain.\nMost buildings on campus have been built within the last half-century, making them newer than most buildings in downtown Youngstown, where most buildings were constructed before the [[Great Depression]].\n\nKilcawley Center is primarily a student-resource and community-center on campus. It features reading and study rooms, computer labs, a copying center, a variety of restaurants (including a [[Chick-Fil-A]], [[Wendy's]] and [[Dunkin' Donuts]]), and many student-affairs offices.

Together with the [[University of Akron]] and [[Kent State University]], YSU sponsors the [[Northeast Ohio Medical University]], a BS-MD program. YSU engineering students may pursue [[doctorate|doctoral]] studies in cooperation with the University of Akron and [[Cleveland State University]]. In addition, YSU has 35 masters programs and over 100 undergraduate majors.\n\nThe Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University was deemed an \"All-[[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]]\" school in 2004. The Dana School of Music is one of the oldest non-conservatory schools of music in the United States.{{Citation needed|year=September 2008|date=February 2011}} Additionally, the Youngstown State University Symphonic Wind Ensemble performed at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]] in March 2005 and again in November 2015.\n\nThe Williamson College of Business holds a [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]] accreditation, the most recognized form of professional accreditation an institution can earn. As of 2018, this accreditation is held by less than five percent of the worlds business schools.\n\n==Administration==\n===Labor relations===\nLabor unions are very active at YSU and include most non-administrative faculty and staff on campus. In August 2005, just before the start of the 2005\u201306 academic year, two of four campus unions were on strike. Following the conclusion of the strike, relations remained strained, with some faculty and staff calling for the resignation of YSU President David Sweet in May 2007.<ref>Gwin, Harold. [https://www.vindy.com/news/2007/may/11/60-ysu-workers-call-for-pres-sweet-to-resign/ \"60 YSU workers call for Pres. Sweet to resign\"], ''[[Youngstown Vindicator]]'', May 11, 2007.</ref> Others on campus thought some individuals on both sides were engaged in less than professional behaviors. Due to the animosity between the parties, a special committee was set up to examine labor relations. This committee recommended that the negotiations teams for all sides be replaced before the next round of contract negotiations. After the committee's recommendations, the Vice President for Administration was replaced, as well as the Executive Director of Human Resources.\n\nRelations have improved since that time and are now typical of what one would expect of a unionized campus in a region that has always been at the center of US union activism.\n\n==Student life==\n===Housing===\nThe university has been looking to increase the amount of available student housing on campus. As of September 2015, there were less than 1,500 student beds available for the more than 12,200 students enrolled. In June 2015, it was announced that a $7.8 million, 162-bed, four-story, privately owned, student housing complex named '''University Edge YSU''' would be built on West Rayen Avenue between Fifth and Belmont avenues by Hallmark Campus Communities of Columbus and Fortress Real Estate Co. of Atlanta. Construction started in late September 2015. In December 2015, it was announced that another apartment complex would be coming to YSU. LRC Realty announced the $10 million, 163-bed, five story, privately, owned retail/student housing complex, called '''The Enclave''', was built on nearly 2 acres between Lincoln and Wick avenues in Youngstown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2015/dec/04/panel-approves-lease-for-more-student-ho/|title=More student housing planned at YSU|first=Denise|last=Dick|website=vindy.com}}</ref> A Representative for LRC Realty said that the building includes a fitness center and an outdoor patio for student residents.

In August 2005, just before the start of the 2005\u201306 academic year, two of four campus unions were on strike. Following the conclusion of the strike, relations remained strained, with some faculty and staff calling for the resignation of YSU President David Sweet in May 2007.<ref>Gwin, Harold. [https://www.vindy.com/news/2007/may/11/60-ysu-workers-call-for-pres-sweet-to-resign/ \"60 YSU workers call for Pres. Sweet to resign\"], ''[[Youngstown Vindicator]]'', May 11, 2007.</ref> Others on campus thought some individuals on both sides were engaged in less than professional behaviors. Due to the animosity between the parties, a special committee was set up to examine labor relations. This committee recommended that the negotiations teams for all sides be replaced before the next round of contract negotiations. After the committee's recommendations, the Vice President for Administration was replaced, as well as the Executive Director of Human Resources.\n\nRelations have improved since that time and are now typical of what one would expect of a unionized campus in a region that has always been at the center of US union activism.\n\n==Student life==\n===Housing===\nThe university has been looking to increase the amount of available student housing on campus.
