{"title_page": "Palladium", "text_new": "{{About|the chemical element}}\n{{short description|chemical element with atomic number 46}}\n{{Infobox palladium}}\n'''Palladium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&nbsp;'''Pd''' and [[atomic number]] 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. He named it after the [[2 Pallas|asteroid Pallas]], which was itself named after the [[epithet]] of the Greek goddess [[Athena]], acquired by her when she slew [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]]. Palladium, [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], [[ruthenium]], [[iridium]] and [[osmium]] form a group of elements referred to as the [[platinum group]] metals (PGMs). They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.\n\nMore than half the supply of palladium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]] platinum is used in [[catalytic converter]]s, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust ([[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]]) into less noxious substances ([[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapor]]). Palladium is also used in electronics, [[dentistry]], [[medicine]], [[hydrogen purification]], chemical applications, [[Groundwater remediation|groundwater treatment]], and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of [[fuel cell]]s, which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.\n\n[[Ore]] [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] covering the [[Transvaal Basin]] in South Africa, the [[Stillwater igneous complex|Stillwater Complex]] in [[Montana]], United States; the [[Sudbury Basin]] and [[Thunder Bay District]] of [[Ontario]], Canada, and the [[Norilsk|Norilsk Complex]] in Russia. [[Recycling]] is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable [[Palladium as an investment|investment]] interest.\n\n==Characteristics==\nPalladium belongs to [[group 10 element|group&nbsp;10]] in the periodic table, but the configuration in the outermost electrons are in accordance with [[Hund's rule]].  Electrons in the [[Atomic orbital|''s''&nbsp;orbital]]{{clarify|date=August 2019|reason=When does the electron \u201cmigrate\u201d from the orbital empty in the ground state?}} migrate to fill the [[Atomic orbital|''d''&nbsp;orbitals]] because they have less energy.{{clarify|date=August 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n![[Atomic number|Z]] !!

It is the least dense and has the lowest [[melting point]] of the platinum group metals. It is soft and [[Ductility|ductile]] when [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated [[nitric acid]], in hot, concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], and when finely ground, in [[hydrochloric acid]].<ref name=CRC>{{cite book|author=Hammond, C.

Palladium heated to 800&nbsp;\u00b0C will produce a layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time, likely due to the formation of a surface layer of its monoxide.\n\nPalladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having ''T''<sub>c</sub>=3.2 K.<ref>B.

He named it after the [[2 Pallas|asteroid Pallas]], which was itself named after the [[epithet]] of the Greek goddess [[Athena]], acquired by her when she slew [[Pallas (daughter of Triton)|Pallas]]. Palladium, [[platinum]], [[rhodium]], [[ruthenium]], [[iridium]] and [[osmium]] form a group of elements referred to as the [[platinum group]] metals (PGMs). They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.\n\nMore than half the supply of palladium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]] platinum is used in [[catalytic converter]]s, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust ([[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[nitrogen dioxide]]) into less noxious substances ([[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapor]]). Palladium is also used in electronics, [[dentistry]], [[medicine]], [[hydrogen purification]], chemical applications, [[Groundwater remediation|groundwater treatment]], and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of [[fuel cell]]s, which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.\n\n[[Ore]] [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] covering the [[Transvaal Basin]] in South Africa, the [[Stillwater igneous complex|Stillwater Complex]] in [[Montana]], United States; the [[Sudbury Basin]] and [[Thunder Bay District]] of [[Ontario]], Canada, and the [[Norilsk|Norilsk Complex]] in Russia.

[[Aurangzeb]], the last Mughal emperor, who spent the latter years of his reign, 1681\u20131707, in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], died in Ahmednagar and is buried at [[Khuldabad]], near Aurangabad in 1707, with a small monument marking the site.\n\nIn 1759, the [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha]]s obtained possession of the place from [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and in 1795 it was ceded by the Peshwa to the Maratha chief [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]]. Ahmednagar was invaded by a British force under [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|General Wellesley]] and captured. It was afterwards restored to the Marathas, but again came into the possession of the British in 1817, according to the terms of the [[Treaty of Poona]], and was known as '''Ahmednuggur'''.\n\n==Military base==\nAhmednagar is home to the Indian Armoured Corps Centre & School (ACC&S), the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre (MIRC), the [[Vehicle Research and Development Establishment]] (VRDE) and the Controllerate of Quality Assurance Vehicles (CQAV). Training and recruitment for the [[Indian Army Armoured Corps]] takes place at the ACC&S. Formerly, the city was the Indian base of the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Tank Corps]] / [[Indian Armoured Corps]], amongst other units.  The town houses the second-largest display of military tanks in the world and largest in Asia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ahmednagar.nic.in/html_docs/history_of_ahmedngar_district.htm |title=The History of Ahmednagar |publisher=Ahmednagar.nic.in |date=15 August 1947 |accessdate=2011-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007150425/http://ahmednagar.nic.in/html_docs/history_of_ahmedngar_district.htm |archive-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2013}}\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nSituated in the rain-shadow region of the Western Ghats, Ahmednagar experiences primarily hot and dry climate through November to mid June. \n{{Weather box\n|location = Ahmednagar (1981\u20132010, extremes 1901\u20132012)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 36.1\n| Feb record high C = 38.9\n| Mar record high C = 43.2\n| Apr record high C = 43.5\n| May record high C = 44.0\n| Jun record high C = 43.3\n| Jul record high C = 37.7\n| Aug record high C = 39.5\n| Sep record high C = 38.2\n| Oct record high C = 39.7\n| Nov record high C = 35.6\n| Dec record high C = 35.6\n| year record high C = 44.0\n| Jan high C = 30.1\n| Feb high C = 32.3\n| Mar high C = 35.7\n| Apr high C = 38.6\n| May high C = 38.6\n| Jun high C = 33.1\n| Jul high C = 29.7\n| Aug high C = 29.2\n| Sep high C = 29.9\n| Oct high C = 31.8\n| Nov high C = 30.3\n| Dec high C = 29.5\n| year high C = 32.4\n| Jan low C = 11.7\n| Feb low C = 13.3\n| Mar low C = 16.8\n| Apr low C = 20.4\n| May low C = 22.5\n| Jun low C = 22.1\n| Jul low C = 21.4\n| Aug low C = 20.9\n| Sep low C = 20.4\n| Oct low C = 18.3\n| Nov low C = 15.0\n| Dec low C = 11.6\n| year low C = 17.9\n| Jan record low C = 1.8\n| Feb record low C = 2.8\n| Mar record low C = 7.5\n| Apr record low C = 9.5\n| May record low C = 15.2\n| Jun record low C = 17.0\n| Jul record low C = 16.5\n| Aug record low C = 12.2\n| Sep record low C = 10.7\n| Oct record low C = 10.6\n| Nov record low C = 5.6\n| Dec record low C = 3.3\n| year record low C = 1.8\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 0.3\n| Feb rain mm = 0.8\n| Mar rain mm = 1.9\n| Apr rain mm = 4.1\n| May rain mm = 22.7\n| Jun rain mm = 124.5\n| Jul rain mm = 90.9\n| Aug rain mm = 99.6\n| Sep rain mm = 186.9\n| Oct rain mm = 72.0\n| Nov rain mm = 24.8\n| Dec rain mm = 6.8\n| year rain mm = 635.4\n| Jan rain days = 0.0\n| Feb rain days = 0.3\n| Mar rain days = 0.3\n| Apr rain days = 0.5\n| May rain days = 1.3\n| Jun rain days = 6.4\n| Jul rain days = 6.0\n| Aug rain days = 5.0\n| Sep rain days = 8.8\n| Oct rain days = 4.2\n| Nov rain days = 1.0\n| Dec rain days = 0.4\n| year rain days = 34.3\n|time day = 17:30 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| Jan humidity = 37\n| Feb humidity = 32\n| Mar humidity = 26\n| Apr humidity = 23\n| May humidity = 30\n| Jun humidity = 58\n| Jul humidity = 68\n| Aug humidity = 70\n| Sep humidity = 68\n| Oct humidity = 57\n| Nov humidity = 52\n| Dec humidity = 43\n|year humidity = 48\n|source 1 = [[India Meteorological Department]]<ref name=IMDnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205040301/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| title = Station: Ahmednagar Climatological Table 1981\u20132010\n| work = Climatological Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = January 2015\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| accessdate = 30 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=IMDextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205042509/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| title = Extremes of Temperature & Rainfall for Indian Stations (Up to 2012)\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = December 2016\n| page = M135\n| accessdate = 30 March 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\nAs of 2011 Indian [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Ahmednagar had a population of 347,549.

[[Aurangzeb]], the last Mughal emperor, who spent the latter years of his reign, 1681\u20131707, in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], died in Ahmednagar and is buried at [[Khuldabad]], near Aurangabad in 1707, with a small monument marking the site.\n\nIn 1759, the [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha]]s obtained possession of the place from [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and in 1795 it was ceded by the Peshwa to the Maratha chief [[Daulat Rao Sindhia]]. Ahmednagar was invaded by a British force under [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|General Wellesley]] and captured. It was afterwards restored to the Marathas, but again came into the possession of the British in 1817, according to the terms of the [[Treaty of Poona]], and was known as '''Ahmednuggur'''.\n\n==Military base==\nAhmednagar is home to the Indian Armoured Corps Centre & School (ACC&S), the Mechanised Infantry Regimental Centre (MIRC), the [[Vehicle Research and Development Establishment]] (VRDE) and the Controllerate of Quality Assurance Vehicles (CQAV). Training and recruitment for the [[Indian Army Armoured Corps]] takes place at the ACC&S. Formerly, the city was the Indian base of the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Tank Corps]] / [[Indian Armoured Corps]], amongst other units.  The town houses the second-largest display of military tanks in the world and largest in Asia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ahmednagar.nic.in/html_docs/history_of_ahmedngar_district.htm |title=The History of Ahmednagar |publisher=Ahmednagar.nic.in |date=15 August 1947 |accessdate=2011-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007150425/http://ahmednagar.nic.in/html_docs/history_of_ahmedngar_district.htm |archive-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2013}}\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nSituated in the rain-shadow region of the Western Ghats, Ahmednagar experiences primarily hot and dry climate through November to mid June. \n{{Weather box\n|location = Ahmednagar (1981\u20132010, extremes 1901\u20132012)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 36.1\n| Feb record high C = 38.9\n| Mar record high C = 43.2\n| Apr record high C = 43.5\n| May record high C = 44.0\n| Jun record high C = 43.3\n| Jul record high C = 37.7\n| Aug record high C = 39.5\n| Sep record high C = 38.2\n| Oct record high C = 39.7\n| Nov record high C = 35.6\n| Dec record high C = 35.6\n| year record high C = 44.0\n| Jan high C = 30.1\n| Feb high C = 32.3\n| Mar high C = 35.7\n| Apr high C = 38.6\n| May high C = 38.6\n| Jun high C = 33.1\n| Jul high C = 29.7\n| Aug high C = 29.2\n| Sep high C = 29.9\n| Oct high C = 31.8\n| Nov high C = 30.3\n| Dec high C = 29.5\n| year high C = 32.4\n| Jan low C = 11.7\n| Feb low C = 13.3\n| Mar low C = 16.8\n| Apr low C = 20.4\n| May low C = 22.5\n| Jun low C = 22.1\n| Jul low C = 21.4\n| Aug low C = 20.9\n| Sep low C = 20.4\n| Oct low C = 18.3\n| Nov low C = 15.0\n| Dec low C = 11.6\n| year low C = 17.9\n| Jan record low C = 1.8\n| Feb record low C = 2.8\n| Mar record low C = 7.5\n| Apr record low C = 9.5\n| May record low C = 15.2\n| Jun record low C = 17.0\n| Jul record low C = 16.5\n| Aug record low C = 12.2\n| Sep record low C = 10.7\n| Oct record low C = 10.6\n| Nov record low C = 5.6\n| Dec record low C = 3.3\n| year record low C = 1.8\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 0.3\n| Feb rain mm = 0.8\n| Mar rain mm = 1.9\n| Apr rain mm = 4.1\n| May rain mm = 22.7\n| Jun rain mm = 124.5\n| Jul rain mm = 90.9\n| Aug rain mm = 99.6\n| Sep rain mm = 186.9\n| Oct rain mm = 72.0\n| Nov rain mm = 24.8\n| Dec rain mm = 6.8\n| year rain mm = 635.4\n| Jan rain days = 0.0\n| Feb rain days = 0.3\n| Mar rain days = 0.3\n| Apr rain days = 0.5\n| May rain days = 1.3\n| Jun rain days = 6.4\n| Jul rain days = 6.0\n| Aug rain days = 5.0\n| Sep rain days = 8.8\n| Oct rain days = 4.2\n| Nov rain days = 1.0\n| Dec rain days = 0.4\n| year rain days = 34.3\n|time day = 17:30 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| Jan humidity = 37\n| Feb humidity = 32\n| Mar humidity = 26\n| Apr humidity = 23\n| May humidity = 30\n| Jun humidity = 58\n| Jul humidity = 68\n| Aug humidity = 70\n| Sep humidity = 68\n| Oct humidity = 57\n| Nov humidity = 52\n| Dec humidity = 43\n|year humidity = 48\n|source 1 = [[India Meteorological Department]]<ref name=IMDnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205040301/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| title = Station: Ahmednagar Climatological Table 1981\u20132010\n| work = Climatological Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = January 2015\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| accessdate = 30 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=IMDextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205042509/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| title = Extremes of Temperature & Rainfall for Indian Stations (Up to 2012)\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = December 2016\n| page = M135\n| accessdate = 30 March 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\nAs of 2011 Indian [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Ahmednagar had a population of 347,549.

Some heterotrophic species consist of non-photosynthetic organelles which includes: Syndiniophyceae and Noctiluciphyceae. The class Syndiniophyceae consists of mostly endoparasitic protists with some undiscovered species. As a result, they exhibit strange physiological behaviors in their aquatic habitats making them difficult to recognize by their class. Exclusively, they parasitize marine organisms such as ciliates.\n\n== Description ==\nIn the beginning, ''I. chabelardi'' was correctly identified as a [[Syndinium|syndinid]]. Even today there are still controversial views on the placement of ''I. chabelardi'' in the phylogenetic tree. Some believe it belongs under the Perkinsoza class based on genetic analysis obtained. However, after further observations of its phenotype, it was discovered that it shares similar morphology with other dinoflagellates. For example, ''I. chabelardi'' may have features that resemble dinospores, trichocysts, or even condensed chromatin found at different trophic stages in dinoflagellates. Not much is known about this parasitic species.\n\n== Life Cycle ==\n''I. chabelardi'' infection varies on the host species<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cuttitta|first=A|last2=Caruana|first2=L.|last3=Di Nieri|first3=A.|last4=Sposito|first4=P.|last5=Patti|first5=C.|last6=Basilone|first6=G.|last7=Bonanno|first7=A.|last8=Patti|first8=B.|last9=Buscaino|first9=G.|last10=Mazzola|first10=S.|date=2006|title=ICHTHYODINIUM CHABELARDI LIKE A KILLER OF ENGRAULIS ENCRASICOLUS EGGS IN THE SICILIAN CHANNEL|url=http://aquasymbio.scrol.net/en/ichthyodinium-chabelardi-463-trophont-trophozoite-trophocyte|journal=Biol. Mar. Medit.|volume=13|issue=2|pages=312\u2013313}}</ref>. In some hosts, the schizonts may reach the second generation while, in other hosts, infection may reach the third generation. Thereafter, they release spores which swim to transmit their infection to other marine organisms. There are two different stages of the schizonts; the primary and the secondary stages.\n\n=== Primary schizonts ===\nThese are the small, transparent, unicellular forms of the parasite not growing more than 20 micrometers in size. Usually, up to 3 schizonts can be found on the yolk sac of fish eggs. Upon infection of the yolk sacs, they penetrate the eggs by absorption of the outer layer of the host egg. Following this, the nucleus undergoes mitosis and the cytoplasm encapsulates each newly formed nucleus forming secondary schizonts.\n\n=== Secondary schizonts ===\nAfter the formation of the secondary schizonts, they become separated into 20 micrometer cylindrical structures. The reason for this is unknown. After separation and growth of these individual structures, they start diving by mitosis partitioning into two longitudinal forms. Meanwhile, two sister cells are still attached to each other by their posterior ends (poles) forming a triangular structure. Afterward, the sister cells form layers of long cords containing about 8 cells per cord with a length ranging between 1-2 mm.\n\n=== Tertiary schizonts ===\nDuring this stage, the schizonts detach themselves from the cords and undergo mitosis again to form spherical structures. Moreover, the yolk sacs of the fish appear to be non transparent because of the single nucleus parasitic stages found in them. These tertiary schizonts develop into [[Zoospore|zoosporangia]] which is hatched and released into the surrounding water around the host. After hatching, this infective stage of the parasite may lead to the rupture of the yolk sac and eventually, the death of the early larval stage . The release of the parasite may vary at times. In some cases, it may be released after the larvae hatches while, in other cases it may be released at least 10 hours later.\n\n== Pathology ==\n\n== Significance ==\n\n== Ecology ==\n<br />\n\n== Transmission and Host range ==\nWhen these spores are in the water, they tend to develop certain features such as flagellates through mitosis and they then develop large trichocysts similar to [[Syndiniales]] helping them attach themselves to other hosts. The nucleus of the spores appear to have participated in early stages of mitosis because of their condensed chromatin structures found in their DNA. Some of the developmental stages of the spores even resemble the developmental stages of some Apicomplexan parasites. The parasitic spores survive outside of their hosts for only a few days but will eventually die since they are not free-living organisms. There is evidence that this parasite does not penetrate but passes through female reproductive opening before it closes up.\n\nThis parasite is considered as a pest to fish farms around the world and fish eggs such as salmon. They tend to parasitize commercially significant fish species such as:\n\n* Risso\n* [[Gilt-head bream|Gilt-head sea bream]] for example [[boops boops]]\n* [[Horse mackerel]]\n* [[European anchovy]]\n* [[Cod]]\n* [[European eel]]\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\nI. chabelardi can be found everywhere in the [[Ocean|oceans]]. Regions in which the parasite has been found are as follows:\n\n* Southern part of China's waters\n* Southern Pacific ocean\n* North-eastern Atlantic ocean\n* [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterannean Sea]]\n\nMoreover, they tend to prefer the warm and temperate parts of the oceans.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nPicture 1. of Ichthyodinium chabelardi on ResearchGate.\n\nPicture 2. of Ichthyodinium chabelardi on ResearchGate.\n[[Category:Syndiniophyceae]]\n", "text_old": "'''''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332965956_A_review_of_the_characteristics_of_the_dinoflagellate_parasite_Ichthyodinium_chabelardi_and_its_potential_effect_on_fin_fish_populations Ichthyodinium chabelardi]''''' is a parasitic species of dinoflagellates from the class [[Syndiniophyceae]].

The real positive axis corresponds to [[complex number]]s <math>z = |z| \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i}\\varphi}</math> with [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] <math>\\varphi = 0</math>.\n\n==Properties==\nThe set <math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math> is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, multiplication, and division. It inherits a [[topology]] from the [[real line]] and, thus, has the structure of a multiplicative [[topological group]] or of an additive [[topological semigroup]].\n\nFor a given positive real number ''x'', the [[sequence]] {''x''<sup>''n''</sup>} of its integral powers has three different fates: When ''x'' \u2208 (0, 1) the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] is zero and when ''x'' \u2208 (1, \u221e) the limit is infinity, while the sequence is constant for ''x'' = 1. The case ''x'' > 1 thus leads to an [[unbounded set|unbounded sequence]].\n\n<math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0} = (0,1) \\cup \\{ 1 \\} \\cup (1,\\infty)</math> and the [[multiplicative inverse]] function exchanges the intervals. The functions [[floor function|floor]], <math>\\operatorname{floor} : [ 1 , \\infty ) \\to \\mathbb{N},\\, x \\mapsto \\lfloor x \\rfloor</math>, and [[sawtooth function|excess]], <math>\\operatorname{excess} : [ 1 , \\infty ) \\to (0,1),\\, x \\mapsto x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor</math>, have been used to describe an element <math>x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math> as a [[continued fraction]] <math>[ n_0; n_1, n_2, \\ldots]</math> which is a sequence of integers obtained from the floor function after the excess has been reciprocated. For <math>x \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math> the sequence terminates with an exact fractional expression of <math>x</math>, and for [[quadratic irrational]] <math>x</math> the sequence becomes a [[periodic continued fraction]].\n\nIn the study of [[classical group]]s, for every <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>, the [[determinant]] gives a map from {{tmath|n \\times n}} matrices over the reals to the real numbers <math>\\mathrm{M}(n, \\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathbf{R}.</math> Restricting to invertible matrices gives a map from the [[general linear group]] to non-zero real numbers: <math>\\mathrm{GL}(n, \\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathbf{R}^\\times</math>. Restricting to matrices with a positive determinant gives the map <math>\\mathrm{GL}^+(n, \\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathbf{R}_{> 0}</math>; interpreting the image as a [[quotient group]] by the [[normal subgroup]] relation {{math|[[SL(n,R)|SL(''n'',\u211d)]]&nbsp;\u25c1&nbsp;GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'',\u211d)}} expresses the positive reals as a [[Lie group]].\n\n==Logarithmic measure==\nIf <math>[a,b] \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math> is an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], then <math>\\mu([a,b]) = \\log(b / a) = \\log \nb - \\log a</math> determines a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on certain subsets of <math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math>, corresponding to the [[pullback]] of the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the real numbers under the logarithm: it is the length on the [[logarithmic scale]]. In fact, it is an [[invariant measure]] with respect to multiplication <math>[a,b] \\to [az, bz]</math> by a <math>z \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math>, just as the Lebesgue measure is invariant under addition. In the context of topological groups, this measure is an example of a [[Haar measure]].\n\nThe utility of this measure is shown in its use for describing [[stellar magnitude]]s and noise levels in [[decibel]]s, among other applications of the [[logarithmic scale]]. For purposes of international standards [[ISO 80000-3]] the dimensionless quantities are referred to as [[level (logarithmic quantity)|levels]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe non-negative reals serve as the [[range of a function|range]] for [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]s, [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s, and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s in mathematics.\n\nIncluding 0, the set <math>\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}</math> has a [[semiring]] structure (0 is the additive identity), known as the [[probability semiring]]; taking logarithms (with a choice of base giving a [[logarithmic unit]]) gives an [[isomorphism]] with the [[log semiring]] (with 0 corresponding to \u2212\u221e), and its units (the finite numbers, excluding \u2212\u221e) correspond to the positive real numbers.\n\n===Square===\nLet <math>Q \\ = \\ \\mathbb{R}_{> 0} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{> 0} ,</math> the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. The quadrant itself is divided into four parts by the line <math>L \\ = \\ \\{(x,y): x = y \\}</math> and the standard hyperbola <math>H \\ = \\ \\{(x,y): xy = 1 \\}.</math>\n\nThe ''L'' \u222a ''H'' forms a trident while ''L'' \u2229 ''H'' = (1,1) is the central point. It is the identity element of two [[one-parameter group]]s that intersect there:\n:<math>\\{\\{(e^a, \\ e^a): a \\in R\\}, \\times \\}</math> on ''L'' and <math>\\{\\{(e^a, \\ e^{-a}): a \\in R\\},\\times \\}</math> on ''H''.\n\nSince <math>\\mathbb{R}_{> 0}</math> is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], ''Q'' is a [[direct product of groups]]. The one-parameter subgroups ''L'' and ''H'' in ''Q'' profile the activity in the product, and ''L'' \u00d7 ''H'' is a resolution of the types of group action.\n\nThe realms of business and science abound in ratios, and any change in ratios draws attention. The study refers to [[hyperbolic coordinates]] in ''Q''. Motion against the ''L'' axis indicates a change in the [[geometric mean]] \u221a(xy), while a change along ''H'' indicates a new [[hyperbolic angle]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem]]\n* [[Dagum distribution]]\n* [[Frans\u00e9n\u2013Robinson constant]]\n* [[Fr\u00e9chet mean]]\n* [[Generalized mean]]\n* [[Meijer G-function]]\n* [[Nesbitt's inequality]]\n* [[Semifield]]\n* [[Silverman's game]]\n* [[Stolarsky mean]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |first=Joseph |last=Kist |first2=Sanford |last2=Leetsma |year=1970 |title=Additive semigroups of positive real numbers |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=188 |issue=3 |pages=214\u2013218 |doi=10.1007/BF01350237 }}\n\n[[Category:Topological groups]]\n[[Category:Measure theory]]\n", "text_old": "In [[mathematics]], the set of '''positive real numbers''', <math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0} = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x > 0 \\right\\}</math>, is the subset of those [[real number]]s that are greater than zero.

It inherits a [[topology]] from the [[real line]] and, thus, has the structure of a multiplicative [[topological group]] or of an additive [[topological semigroup]].\n\nFor a given positive real number ''x'', the [[sequence]] {''x''<sup>''n''</sup>} of its integral powers has three different fates: When ''x'' \u2208 (0, 1) the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] is zero and when ''x'' \u2208 (1, \u221e) the limit is infinity, while the sequence is constant for ''x'' = 1. The case ''x'' > 1 thus leads to an [[unbounded set|unbounded sequence]].\n\n<math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0} = (0,1) \\cup \\{ 1 \\} \\cup (1,\\infty)</math> and the [[multiplicative inverse]] function exchanges the intervals. The functions [[floor function|floor]], <math>\\operatorname{floor} : [ 1 , \\infty ) \\to \\mathbb{N},\\, x \\mapsto \\lfloor x \\rfloor</math>, and [[sawtooth function|excess]], <math>\\operatorname{excess} : [ 1 , \\infty ) \\to (0,1),\\, x \\mapsto x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor</math>, have been used to describe an element <math>x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math> as a [[continued fraction]] <math>[ n_0; n_1, n_2, \\ldots]</math> which is a sequence of integers obtained from the floor function after the excess has been reciprocated. For <math>x \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math> the sequence terminates with an exact fractional expression of <math>x</math>, and for [[quadratic irrational]] <math>x</math> the sequence becomes a [[periodic continued fraction]].\n\nIn the study of [[classical group]]s, for every <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>, the [[determinant]] gives a map from {{tmath|n \\times n}} matrices over the reals to the real numbers <math>\\mathrm{M}(n, \\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathbf{R}.</math> Restricting to invertible matrices gives a map from the [[general linear group]] to non-zero real numbers: <math>\\mathrm{GL}(n, \\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathbf{R}^\\times</math>. Restricting to matrices with a positive determinant gives the map <math>\\mathrm{GL}^+(n, \\mathbf{R}) \\to \\mathbf{R}_{> 0}</math>; interpreting the image as a [[quotient group]] by the [[normal subgroup]] relation {{math|[[SL(n,R)|SL(''n'',\u211d)]]&nbsp;\u25c1&nbsp;GL<sup>+</sup>(''n'',\u211d)}} expresses the positive reals as a [[Lie group]].\n\n==Logarithmic measure==\nIf <math>[a,b] \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math> is an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], then <math>\\mu([a,b]) = \\log(b / a) = \\log \nb - \\log a</math> determines a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on certain subsets of <math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math>, corresponding to the [[pullback]] of the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the real numbers under the logarithm: it is the length on the [[logarithmic scale]]. In fact, it is an [[invariant measure]] with respect to multiplication <math>[a,b] \\to [az, bz]</math> by a <math>z \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math>, just as the Lebesgue measure is invariant under addition. In the context of topological groups, this measure is an example of a [[Haar measure]].\n\nThe utility of this measure is shown in its use for describing [[stellar magnitude]]s and noise levels in [[decibel]]s, among other applications of the [[logarithmic scale]]. For purposes of international standards [[ISO 80000-3]] the dimensionless quantities are referred to as [[level (logarithmic quantity)|levels]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe non-negative reals serve as the [[range (mathematics)|range]] for [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]s, [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s, and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s in mathematics.\n\nIncluding 0, the set <math>\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}</math> has a [[semiring]] structure (0 is the additive identity), known as the [[probability semiring]]; taking logarithms (with a choice of base giving a [[logarithmic unit]]) gives an [[isomorphism]] with the [[log semiring]] (with 0 corresponding to \u2212\u221e), and its units (the finite numbers, excluding \u2212\u221e) correspond to the positive real numbers.\n\n===Square===\nLet <math>Q \\ = \\ \\mathbb{R}_{> 0} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{> 0} ,</math> the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. The quadrant itself is divided into four parts by the line <math>L \\ = \\ \\{(x,y): x = y \\}</math> and the standard hyperbola <math>H \\ = \\ \\{(x,y): xy = 1 \\}.</math>\n\nThe ''L'' \u222a ''H'' forms a trident while ''L'' \u2229 ''H'' = (1,1) is the central point. It is the identity element of two [[one-parameter group]]s that intersect there:\n:<math>\\{\\{(e^a, \\ e^a): a \\in R\\}, \\times \\}</math> on ''L'' and <math>\\{\\{(e^a, \\ e^{-a}): a \\in R\\},\\times \\}</math> on ''H''.\n\nSince <math>\\mathbb{R}_{> 0}</math> is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], ''Q'' is a [[direct product of groups]]. The one-parameter subgroups ''L'' and ''H'' in ''Q'' profile the activity in the product, and ''L'' \u00d7 ''H'' is a resolution of the types of group action.\n\nThe realms of business and science abound in ratios, and any change in ratios draws attention. The study refers to [[hyperbolic coordinates]] in ''Q''. Motion against the ''L'' axis indicates a change in the [[geometric mean]] \u221a(xy), while a change along ''H'' indicates a new [[hyperbolic angle]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Bohr\u2013Mollerup theorem]]\n* [[Dagum distribution]]\n* [[Frans\u00e9n\u2013Robinson constant]]\n* [[Fr\u00e9chet mean]]\n* [[Generalized mean]]\n* [[Meijer G-function]]\n* [[Nesbitt's inequality]]\n* [[Semifield]]\n* [[Silverman's game]]\n* [[Stolarsky mean]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |first=Joseph |last=Kist |first2=Sanford |last2=Leetsma |year=1970 |title=Additive semigroups of positive real numbers |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=188 |issue=3 |pages=214\u2013218 |doi=10.1007/BF01350237 }}\n\n[[Category:Topological groups]]\n[[Category:Measure theory]]\n", "name_user": "Tea2min", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eApplications:DisambiguateRange (mathematics)(which redirects toRange#Mathematics) toRange of a function.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_real_numbers"}
