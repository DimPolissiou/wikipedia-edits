It combines the usual two steps of the construction of [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) followed by the population process of placing various leaded and non-leaded electronic components into one process.\n\n==The Occam process==\nElectronic components are first positioned onto an adhesive layer of a temporary or permanent substrate according to the customers needs and design parameters. Then, the  pre-tested, burned-in components are held firm in their positions through encapsulating them in insulating material and the entire assembly is then inverted. The adhesive layer is then cut (after removing the temporary substrate if it exists) or drilled out over the component leads mechanically or by [[laser ablation]]. These holes are then plated with a conductive, copper connection ([[Via (electronics)|vias]]) from the top of this layer to the leads. If needed, other encapsulation layers of components or vias can be placed on top of each other to make multi-level circuit connections. This construction is then coated with copper where needed to provide traces. Thus, this finished circuit board can now receive a [[conformal coating]] to protect against the environment, and then be placed into an assembly housing or be sent to another section for mechanical and/or electrical connections with other PCBs.<ref>\"Robust, Simplified and Solder-Free Assembly Processing of Electronics Products, Verdant Electronics White Paper, Sunnyvale, CA, 2007</ref><ref name=\"Davy\">{{cite news|first=Gordan |last=Davy |url=http://www.smta.org/files/Capital_Vendor_Occam.pdf |title=Occam Process Introduction |work=Surface Mount Technology Association |date= |accessdate=2009-09-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe process was named in reference to a quotation from [[William of Ockham]] (1288\u20131348), who said, \"It is vanity to do with more that which can be done with less.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.verdantelectronics.com |title=Verdant Electronics homepage |work= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Main advantages==\nThe 2006, European, RoHS regulations prompted the research needed to move from traditional lead-based solder connection processes to a more environmentally friendly approach.

It is the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, and has been reported as the largest Asian shopping mall in the [[Western world]]. The mall is located on the northeast corner of [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], along the city limits with [[Toronto]]. Opened in the mid-1990s amid a period of significant  [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|Chinese immigration to Canada]], the mall operates as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]] with 450 individual units. The mall also includes Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that functions as a notable [[tourism in Canada|tourist destination]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. \n\nAn [[Remington Centre|addition to Pacific Mall]] that would occupy the site formerly held by [[Market Village]], a now-defunct mall adjacent to Pacific Mall, was announced in 2005. The expansion would see the construction of a structure that would bring the combined size of the malls to {{conv|1000000|ft2|m2|sigfig=1}}, though the project has faced numerous delays. Pacific Mall is noted as a location for the sale of [[counterfeit goods]]; stores in Pacific Mall have been raided multiple times by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and in 2018 the mall was listed as a [[Notorious markets|notorious market]] by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Pacific Mall===\nPacific Mall is built on the site formerly occupied by Cullen Country Barns, a farm-themed complex opened in 1983 that housed shops, a theatre, and restaurants.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}} The complex was established by Len Cullen, the founder of [[Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village]] in [[Whitby, Ontario]], and consisted of two barn wings with [[gambrel]] roofs and a concrete silo. None were historic structures dating back to the time when the site was a working farm, but they were acquired by Cullen and moved from [[Pickering, Ontario]] to Markham in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Len Cullen was visionary industry pioneer |url=https://horttrades.com/len-cullen |website=Landscape Ontario Horticultural Trades Association |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=30 March 2016}}</ref> A fire damaged part of the complex in 1988,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Irish |first1=Paul |title=Frontal attack |url=https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/fire-fighters-struggle-to-break-through-the-west-wall-of-news-photo/499290885?#/frontal-attack-fire-fighters-struggle-to-break-through-the-west-wall-picture-id499290885 |website=[[Getty Images]] |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=18 October 1998}}</ref> and it was demolished in 1994; some portions of the former [[Market Village]], a shopping complex adjacent to Pacific Mall, mimicked the Cullen complex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Low |first1=Jeff |title=Then and Now: Cullen Country Barns and Pacific Mall |url=https://urbantoronto.ca/news/2013/02/then-and-now-cullen-country-barns-and-pacific-mall |website=Urban Toronto |accessdate=21 October 2019 |date=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to Heritage Town in Pacific Mall]]\n[[File:Egg waffle stand at Pacific Mall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[egg waffle]] stand at Pacific Mall]]\nPlanning for Pacific Mall began in the late 1980s amid the formation of Chinese immigrant communities in suburban [[Toronto]] and a flourishing of ethnic malls in Markham, [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=14}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=112}} The mall was planned and constructed amid the so-called \"Hong Kong Tide\" of the 1980s and 1990s, which saw an increase in immigration to Canada by highly educated, skilled migrants from Hong Kong who were frequently wealthy entrepreneurs and investors.{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=113}} This immigration was influenced by a range of factors, notably the [[handover of Hong Kong]], and new Canadian [[Immigration to Canada|open-door immigration policies]] that recruited based on merit rather than national origin.<ref name=\"GM1\"/>{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=112}} The passage of the [[Investment Canada Act]], which sought to direct business migrants and foreign capital into Canada, is also noted as a factor.{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=113}} Of additional note is the implementation of the [[Canadian Immigrant Investor Program]] (CANIIP), which granted landed immigrant status to individuals with least [[CAD$]]500,000 in wealth who agreed to invest $250,000 in Canadian business ventures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=137}} As a result of this immigration, Markham's ethnic Chinese population rose 15 percent in 1995, resulting in nearly 30 percent of Markham's population being of Chinese origin;{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=139}} by 1999, there would be a total of 58 Asian shopping malls in Markham, Richmond Hill, and Scarborough.<ref name=\"GM1\"/> \n\nA large-scale, indoor Asian mall to be built on the former site of Cullen Country Barns was formally proposed in 1993 by Torgan Group, an [[Israeli-Canadian]] development company,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=118}} with the [[Fairchild Group]] as a partner.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ley |first1=David |title=Millionaire Migrants: Trans-Pacific Life Lines |date=2011 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9781444399530}}</ref> The mall would operate as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]], where shop units are owned by individuals who determine the store's inventory and business hours, and can sell the unit at will. The developers of Pacific Mall claimed they were the first mall in North America to use this business model,{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=115}} though Pacific Mall was preceded by the condominium mall Chinatown Centre in [[Chinatown, Toronto#West Chinatown|West Chinatown, Toronto]], which opened in 1989.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=138}}\n\nThe mall's construction was opposed by some long-term residents of Markham,{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=120}} and was delayed numerous times from 1993 to 1996.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=141}} Concerns were raised by [[Markham City Council]] over the impact the mall would have parking and traffic volume, the style of the building that would replace Cullen Country Barns, and challenges in dealing with multiple owners in a condo-style mall.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=118}} The Council commissioned an independent study on retail condominiums by John Winter and Associates, which concluded that retail condos are a positive means of diversifying developments.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=144}} Pacific Mall's application underwent a nine-month review,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=145}} with a building permit granted in May 1995.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=144}}\n\nHistorian Erica Allen-Kim argues that Pacific Mall was \"a weathervane for Markham's ongoing transformation from a rural township to an [[ethnoburb]].\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=133}} Then-deputy mayor of Markham Carole Bell received criticism for her statement that \"everything's going Chinese\" in response to the proliferation of ethnic malls.<ref name=\"GM1\">{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Jan |title=Not made in China |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/not-made-in-china/article746929/ |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=22 October 2019 |date=6 November 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Matt |title=Ethnic Relations I: The Evolution of Steeles and Kennedy |url=http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |website=Green Beam City |accessdate=22 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522023252/http://green.hyperdot.net/ethnic-relations-i-the-evolution-of-steeles-and-kennedy |archivedate=22 May 2010 |date=5 July 2010}}</ref> She attempted to implement by-laws that would have forbid the rezoning of industrial areas for retail condominiums and made English-language signs mandatory on all structures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=133}} Then-mayor of Markham [[Don Cousens]] formed an advisory council of eleven Markham residents and three members of council to \"address associated multicultural issues affecting planning decisions.\"{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=144}}\n\n===Opening and continued operation===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Emperor's chair at Heritage Town in Pacific Mall]]\nSources report Pacific Mall as opening either in 1996<ref name=\"1996 Opening\"/> or 1997.<ref name=\"1997 Opening\"/> Its Cantonese name, \"\u592a\u53e4\u5ee3\u5834\" (Tai Gu Gwong Cheung), is derived from [[Pacific Place (Hong Kong)|Pacific Place]] in [[Hong Kong]].

[[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, and has been reported as the largest Asian shopping mall in the [[Western world]]. The mall is located on the northeast corner of [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], along the city limits with [[Toronto]]. Opened in the mid-1990s amid a period of significant  [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|Chinese immigration to Canada]], the mall operates as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]] with 450 individual units. The mall also includes Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that functions as a notable [[tourism in Canada|tourist destination]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. \n\nAn [[Remington Centre|addition to Pacific Mall]] that would occupy the site formerly held by [[Market Village]], a now-defunct mall adjacent to Pacific Mall, was announced in 2005. The expansion would see the construction of a structure that would bring the combined retail space of the malls to {{conv|1000000|ft2|m2|sigfig=1}}, though the project has faced numerous delays. Pacific Mall is noted as a location for the sale of [[counterfeit goods]]; stores in Pacific Mall have been raided multiple times by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and in 2018 the mall was listed as a [[Notorious markets|notorious market]] by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Pacific Mall===\nPacific Mall is built on the site formerly occupied by Cullen Country Barns, a farm-themed complex opened in 1983 that housed shops, a theatre, and restaurants.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}} The complex was established by Len Cullen, the founder of [[Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village]] in [[Whitby, Ontario]], and consisted of two barn wings with [[gambrel]] roofs and a concrete silo.

In 1837, the lake was again dammed, but at the location of the current dam, this time by the Morris Canal & Banking Company to supply water to the Pompton Feeder of the Morris Canal.  The enlarged lake now flooded the Succor Brook at the northern end, forming the East Arm, surrounded \"Lime Ridge\" to create Chapel Island, and flooded the extreme southern end, including parts of Belcher Creek.\n \nThe enlarged lake began to attract tourists. The Montclair and Greenwood Lake Railway reached the lake at Awosting around 1874, and the \"State Line\" (later [[Sterling Forest, New York|Sterling Forest]]) depot was established around 1876. (This railway later became the [[New York and Greenwood Lake Railway (1878\u20131943)|New York and Greenwood Lake Railway]], and then the Greenwood Lake Division of the Erie Railway.) During its resort era, several [[steamboat]]s operated on the lake, including the Greenwood Lake Transportation Company's ''Arlington'', ''Milford'', and their side-wheeler, ''Montclair'', built in 1876, which had two decks and is reported to have been capable of carrying from 200 to 400 passengers.<ref name=about/>  There were also other steamers that were privately run, such as the Pioneer and the Anita, and smaller steam launches, such as the Wilhelmina, the Carrie T., and the Ferncliff, run by specific hotels.  These steamboats met the trains and took passengers to the various resorts around the lake in both states.\n\nThere is a [[seaplane]] area on the lake, a few large [[marina]]s and lakeside [[restaurant]]s with [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s.  [[Greenwood Lake Airport]] just south of the lake has a runway long enough to handle small [[Jet aircraft|jets]].\n\nThere are numerous marinas and restaurants along Greenwood Lake.\n\nIn 2011, the film \"The Magic of Bell Isle\" starring Morgan Freeman was filmed along the lake.\n\n== Works about the lake ==\n{{See|Jasper Francis Cropsey}}\nJasper Francis Cropsey created several paintings of Greenwood Lake beginning in 1843.
