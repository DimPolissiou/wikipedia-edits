It aims to broaden the agenda of the first waves of feminism, which largely focused on the experiences of white, middle-class women. The broad agenda means that intersectionality is used to find combinations of injustices that are felt by members of society. For example, a black woman might face discrimination from a company that is not distinctly due to her race (because the company does not discriminate against black men) nor her [[gender]] (because the company does not discriminate against white women), but by a unique combination of the two. Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from [[white feminism]] by acknowledging the fact that all women have different experiences and identities.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/|title=What Does Intersectional Feminsim Actually Mean?|date=May 11, 2018|website=International Women's Development Agency|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423154503/https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/|archive-date=23 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It is a qualitative [[analytic framework]] that identifies how interlocking systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]] affect those who are most [[Social exclusion|marginalized in society]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intersectionality|volume = 1|last=Cooper|first=Brittney|date=1 February 2016|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.013.20}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=May 2019}} The term was coined by [[black feminist]] scholar [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw]] in 1989.<ref name='Crenshaw 1'/><ref name='Crenshaw 2'/><ref name=\":2\"/> There are various forms of [[social stratification]] such as [[Social class|class]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, creed, [[Disability|ability]], and [[gender]], which are included in the consideration of intersectional feminism and its social and cultural effects. The purpose of intersectionality as a theory is to identify how overlapping categories of identity impact individuals and institutions, and take these relationships into account when working to promote social and political equity.<ref name=\":3\" /> It ensures that feminism considers not only gender, but also combinations of various types of oppression that result in people's experiences of injustice. While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society, today the analysis has expanded to include many more aspects of social identity. Race and gender bias are two separate issues; however, they can be combined to create even more harm. Intersectionality is used to describe this phenomenon of being impacted and oppressed by multiple sources, but only treated for one.<ref>{{Citation|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberl\u00e9|title=The urgency of intersectionality|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Intersectionality may also be related to the term [[triple oppression]], which engages with similar themes. Ironically, Intersectionality is also the basis for all discrimination, because it takes historical events of oppression based on immutable characteristics and extrapolates them on to current situations and individuals. In short it assigns character traits and flaws, solely based on one's immutable characteristics, making it inherently discriminate. <ref>{{Citation|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberl\u00e9|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex:\nA Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&context=uclf|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>   \n\nIntersectionality has been critiqued as being inherently ambiguous. The ambiguity of this theory means that it can be perceived as unorganized and lacking a clear set of defining goals; this arguably means that intersectionality will be unlikely to achieve equality due to its unfocused agenda. Without a clear focus, it is difficult for a movement to create change because having such a broad theory makes it harder for people to fully understand its goals. As it is based in [[standpoint theory]], critics say the focus on subjective experiences can lead to contradictions and the inability to identify common causes of oppression.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{external media|width=210px|align=right | topic = [[Women of the World Festival|Women of the World Festival 2016]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA ''Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw \u2013 On Intersectionality''] via [[Southbank Centre]] on [[YouTube]]<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw|Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw]] | date= 14 March 2016 | accessdate= 31 May 2016 | title= Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw \u2013 On Intersectionality \u2013 keynote \u2013 WOW 2016 | medium= Video | publisher= [[Southbank Centre]] via YouTube | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610104533/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA | archive-date= 10 June 2016 | url-status= live }}</ref>}}\n\nThe concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked by feminist theory and movements.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Thompson | first = Becky | title = Multiracial feminism: recasting the chronology of Second Wave Feminism | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 337\u2013360 | doi = 10.2307/3178747 | jstor = 3178747 | date = Summer 2002 | ref = harv| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e742ad93c990615a97d8c857597206b6ebaf54b }}</ref> As articulated by author [[bell hooks]], the emergence of intersectionality \"challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate\".<ref name=\"bell hooks 2014\">{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Feminist Theory: from margin to center | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | origyear = 1984 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781138821668 }}</ref> The historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement in the United States resulted in many black 19th and 20th century feminists, such as [[Anna J.

For example, Deborah K. King published the article \"Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology\" in 1988, just before Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality. In the article King addresses what soon became the foundation for intersectionality, saying, \"Black women have long recognized the special circumstances of our lives in the United States: the commonalities that we share with all women, as well as the bonds that connect us to the men of our race.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Deborah K.|date=1988|title=Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology|journal=Signs|volume=14|issue=1|pages=42\u201372|issn=0097-9740|jstor=3174661|doi=10.1086/494491}}</ref> Additionally, [[Gloria Wekker]] describes how [[Gloria E.

Structural intersectionality deals with how non-white women experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different than that of white women. Political intersectionality examines how laws and policies intended to increase equality have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against non-white women. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how [[Popular culture|pop culture]] portrayals of non-white women can obscure their own authentic lived experiences.<ref name=\"Crenshaw 1991\" />\n\nThe term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the further development of Crenshaw's work in the writings of sociologist [[Patricia Hill Collins]]. Crenshaw's term, Collins says, replaced her own previous coinage \"black feminist thought\", and \"increased the general applicability of her theory from African American women to all women\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = Susan A. | last2 = Huffman | first2 = Douglas J. | title = The decentering of second wave feminism and the rise of the third wave | journal = [[Science & Society]] | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 56\u201391 | jstor = 40404229 | date = January 2005 | ref = harv | doi=10.1521/siso.69.1.56.56799}}</ref>{{rp|61}} Much like Crenshaw, Collins argues that cultural patterns of oppression are not only interrelated, but are bound together and influenced by the intersectional systems of society, such as race, gender, class, and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Collins 2000\"/>{{rp|42}} Collins describes this as \"interlocking social institutions [that] have relied on multiple forms of segregation... to produce unjust results\".<ref>Collins, Patricia Hill (2009) [1990], \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=icWTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA277 Towards a politics of empowerment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203045/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=icWTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA277 |date=2 December 2017 }}\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Collins | editor-first = Patricia Hill | editor-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment | page = 277 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780415964722 | title-link = Black Feminist Thought | year = 2009 }}</ref>\n\nCollins sought to create frameworks to think about intersectionality, rather than expanding on the theory itself. She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various [[social institutions]] in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality.

Joy James takes things one step further by \"using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena\". Collins later integrated these three views by examining a black political economy through the centering of black women's experiences and the use of a theoretical framework of intersectionality.<ref name=\"Collins 2000\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nCollins uses a [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminist]] approach and applies her intersectional principles to what she calls the \"work/family nexus and black women's poverty\".

Smith|Dorothy Smith]] have been instrumental in providing a sociological definition of [[standpoint theory]]. A standpoint is an individual's unique world perspective. The theoretical basis of this approach views societal knowledge as being located within an individual's specific geographic location.

Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was a debate on what these societal categories were, and how they played a role in the lives of many minorities. What was once a more cut and dry categorization between gender, race, and class has turned into a multidimensional intersection of \"race\" including religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK, they refer to these intersections under the notion of multiple discrimination. The EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; however, there is debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities.<ref>Lawson, Anna. European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality : Investigating the Triangle of Racial, Gender and Disability Discrimination, edited by Dagmar Schiek, Routledge, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central</ref> The EU is not the only organization that is acknowledging this concept. People around the world are taking a new approach when identifying other identities as well as their own; however, there are still places that follow the traditional process of categorization as stated in the following quote. \"The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell).\"<ref>Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities: Global, Transnational and Local Contexts, edited by Esther Ngan-ling Chow, and Tan Lin, Emerald Publishing Limited, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central</ref> This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.\n\nFor example, Chandra Mohanty discusses alliances between women throughout the world as intersectionality in a global context. She rejects the western feminist theory, especially when it writes about global women of color and generally associated \"third world women\". She argues that \"third world women\" are often thought of as a homogenous entity, when, in fact, their experience of oppression is informed by their geography, history, and culture. When western feminists write about women in the global South in this way, they dismiss the inherent intersecting identities that are present in the dynamic of feminism in the global South. Mohanty questions the performance of intersectionality and relationality of power structures within the US and colonialism and how to work across identities with this history of colonial power structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohanty|first=Chandra|date=Spring-Autumn 1984|title=Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses|url=|journal=Boundary 2|volume=12|pages=|via=JSTOR}}</ref> This lack of homogeneity and intersecting identities can be seen through [[Feminism in India]], which goes over how women in India practice feminism within social structures and the continuing effects of colonization that differ from that of Western and other non-Western countries.\n\nThis is elaborated on by Christine Bose, who discusses a global use of intersectionality which works to remove associations of specific inequalities with specific institutions, while showing that these systems generate intersectional effects. She uses this approach to develop a framework that can analyze gender inequalities across different nations and differentiates this from an approach (the one that Mohanty was referring to) which, one, paints national-level inequalities as the same and, two, differentiates only between the global North and South. This is manifested through the intersection of global dynamics like economics, migration, or violence, with regional dynamics, like histories of the nation or gendered inequalities in education and property education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BOSE|first=CHRISTINE E.|date=2012|title=Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality|journal=Gender and Society|volume=26|issue=1|pages=67\u201372|issn=0891-2432|jstor=23212241|doi=10.1177/0891243211426722}}</ref>\n\nThere is an issue globally with the way the law interacts with intersectionality, for example, the UK's legislation to protect workers rights has a distinct issue with intersectionality.

She has identified several ways in which the conventional theory has been destructive to the movement. She asserts that the common practice of using intersectionality to attack other ways of feminist thinking and the tendency of academics to critique intersectionality instead of using intersectionality as a tool to critique other conventional ways of thinking has been a misuse of the ideas it stands for. Tomlinson argues that in order to use intersectional theory correctly, intersectional feminists must not only consider the arguments but the tradition and mediums through which these arguments are made. Conventional academics are likely to favor writings by authors or publications with prior established credibility instead of looking at the quality of each piece individually, contributing to negative stereotypes associated with both feminism and intersectionality by having weaker arguments in defense of feminism and intersectionality become prominent based on renown. She goes on to argue that this allows critics of intersectionality to attack these weaker arguments, \"[reducing] intersectionality's radical critique of power to desires for identity and inclusion, and offer a deradicalized intersectionality as an asset for dominant disciplinary discourses\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Tomlinson | first = Barbara | title = To Tell the Truth and Not Get Trapped: Desire, Distance, and Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 993\u20131017 | doi = 10.1086/669571 | date = Summer 2013 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\nSharon Goldman of the Israel-America Studies Program at Shalem College also criticized intersectionality on the basis of its being too simplistic. Goldman stipulates that many of the people championed by intersectionality truly are victims of oppression, but her reading of the ideology is that it favors the powerless over the powerful regardless of context. Any group that overcomes adversity, achieves independence, or defends itself successfully is seen as corrupt or imperialist by intersectionality adherents. The examples Goldman gives are American Jews who, inspired by the abject victimhood of [[the Holocaust]], engaged in politics to successfully advance their ideas into the American mainstream.

As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy. Even if an objective definition of oppression was reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed.

It aims to broaden the agenda of the first waves of feminism, which largely focused on the experiences of white, middle-class women. The broad agenda means that intersectionality is used to find combinations of injustices that are felt by members of society. For example, a black woman might face discrimination from a company that is not distinctly due to her race (because the company does not discriminate against black men) nor her [[gender]] (because the company does not discriminate against white women), but by a unique combination of the two. Intersectional feminism aims to separate itself from [[white feminism]] by acknowledging the fact that all women have different experiences and identities.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/|title=What Does Intersectional Feminsim Actually Mean?|date=May 11, 2018|website=International Women's Development Agency|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423154503/https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/|archive-date=23 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It is a qualitative [[analytic framework]] that identifies how interlocking systems of [[Power (social and political)|power]] affect those who are most [[Social exclusion|marginalized in society]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intersectionality|volume = 1|last=Cooper|first=Brittney|date=1 February 2016|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199328581.013.20}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=May 2019}} The term was coined by [[black feminist]] scholar [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw]] in 1989.<ref name='Crenshaw 1'/><ref name='Crenshaw 2'/><ref name=\":2\"/> There are various forms of [[social stratification]] such as [[Social class|class]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], age, religion, creed, [[Disability|ability]], and [[gender]], which are included in the consideration of intersectional feminism and its social and cultural effects. The purpose of intersectionality as a theory is to identify how overlapping categories of identity impact individuals and institutions, and take these relationships into account when working to promote social and political equity.<ref name=\":3\" /> It ensures that feminism considers not only gender, but also combinations of various types of oppression that result in people's experiences of injustice. While the theory began as an exploration of the oppression of women of color within society, today the analysis has expanded to include many more aspects of social identity. Race and gender bias are two separate issues; however, they can be combined to create even more harm. Intersectionality is used to describe this phenomenon of being impacted and oppressed by multiple sources, but only treated for one.<ref>{{Citation|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberl\u00e9|title=The urgency of intersectionality|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Intersectionality may also be related to the term [[triple oppression]], which engages with similar themes.   \n\nIntersectionality has been critiqued as being inherently ambiguous. The ambiguity of this theory means that it can be perceived as unorganized and lacking a clear set of defining goals; this arguably means that intersectionality will be unlikely to achieve equality due to its unfocused agenda. Without a clear focus, it is difficult for a movement to create change because having such a broad theory makes it harder for people to fully understand its goals. As it is based in [[standpoint theory]], critics say the focus on subjective experiences can lead to contradictions and the inability to identify common causes of oppression.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{external media|width=210px|align=right | topic = [[Women of the World Festival|Women of the World Festival 2016]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA ''Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw \u2013 On Intersectionality''] via [[Southbank Centre]] on [[YouTube]]<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw|Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw]] | date= 14 March 2016 | accessdate= 31 May 2016 | title= Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw \u2013 On Intersectionality \u2013 keynote \u2013 WOW 2016 | medium= Video | publisher= [[Southbank Centre]] via YouTube | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610104533/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DW4HLgYPlA | archive-date= 10 June 2016 | url-status= live }}</ref>}}\n\nThe concept of intersectionality is intended to illuminate dynamics that have often been overlooked by feminist theory and movements.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Thompson | first = Becky | title = Multiracial feminism: recasting the chronology of Second Wave Feminism | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 337\u2013360 | doi = 10.2307/3178747 | jstor = 3178747 | date = Summer 2002 | ref = harv| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e742ad93c990615a97d8c857597206b6ebaf54b }}</ref> As articulated by author [[bell hooks]], the emergence of intersectionality \"challenged the notion that 'gender' was the primary factor determining a woman's fate\".<ref name=\"bell hooks 2014\">{{cite book | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Feminist Theory: from margin to center | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2014 | origyear = 1984 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781138821668 }}</ref> The historical exclusion of black women from the feminist movement in the United States resulted in many black 19th and 20th century feminists, such as [[Anna J.

Structural intersectionality deals with how non-white women experience domestic violence and rape in a manner qualitatively different than that of white women. Political intersectionality examines how laws and policies intended to increase equality have paradoxically decreased the visibility of violence against non-white women. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how [[Popular culture|pop culture]] portrayals of non-white women can obscure their own authentic lived experiences.<ref name=\"Crenshaw 1991\" />\n\nThe term gained prominence in the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the further development of Crenshaw's work in the writings of sociologist [[Patricia Hill Collins]].

She identified three main branches of study within intersectionality. One branch deals with the background, ideas, issues, conflicts, and debates within intersectionality. Another branch seeks to apply intersectionality as an analytical strategy to various [[social institutions]] in order to examine how they might perpetuate social inequality.

Joy James takes things one step further by \"using paradigms of intersectionality in interpreting social phenomena\".

In her 2000 article \"Black Political Economy\" she describes how, in her view, the intersections of [[consumer racism]], gender hierarchies, and disadvantages in the labor market can be centered on black women's unique experiences.

Before Crenshaw coined her definition of intersectionality, there was a debate on what these societal categories were, and how they played a role in the lives of many minorities. What was once a more cut and dry categorization between gender, race, and class has turned into a multidimensional intersection of \"race\" including religion, sexuality, ethnicities, etc. In the EU and UK, they refer to these intersections under the notion of multiple discrimination. The EU passed a non-discrimination law which addresses these multiple intersections; however, there is debate on whether the law is still proactively focusing on the proper inequalities.<ref>Lawson, Anna. European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality : Investigating the Triangle of Racial, Gender and Disability Discrimination, edited by Dagmar Schiek, Routledge, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central</ref> The EU is not the only organization that is acknowledging this concept. People around the world are taking a new approach when identifying other identities as well as their own; however, there are still places that follow the traditional process of categorization as stated in the following quote. \"The impact of patriarchy and traditional assumptions about gender and families are evident in the lives of Chinese migrant workers (Chow, Tong), sex workers and their clients in South Korea (Shin), and Indian widows (Chauhan), but also Ukrainian migrants (Amelina) and Australian men of the new global middle class (Connell).\"<ref>Analyzing Gender, Intersectionality, and Multiple Inequalities: Global, Transnational and Local Contexts, edited by Esther Ngan-ling Chow, and Tan Lin, Emerald Publishing Limited, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central</ref> This text suggests that there are many more intersections of discrimination for people around the globe than Crenshaw originally accounted for in her definition.\n\nFor example, Chandra Mohanty discusses alliances between women throughout the world as intersectionality in a global context. She rejects the western feminist theory, especially when it writes about global women of color and generally associated \"third world women\". She argues that \"third world women\" are often thought of as a homogenous entity, when, in fact, their experience of oppression is informed by their geography, history, and culture. When western feminists write about women in the global South in this way, they dismiss the inherent intersecting identities that are present in the dynamic of feminism in the global South. Mohanty questions the performance of intersectionality and relationality of power structures within the US and colonialism and how to work across identities with this history of colonial power structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohanty|first=Chandra|date=Spring-Autumn 1984|title=Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses|url=|journal=Boundary 2|volume=12|pages=|via=JSTOR}}</ref> This lack of homogeneity and intersecting identities can be seen through [[Feminism in India]], which goes over how women in India practice feminism within social structures and the continuing effects of colonization that differ from that of Western and other non-Western countries.\n\nThis is elaborated on by Christine Bose, who discusses a global use of intersectionality which works to remove associations of specific inequalities with specific institutions, while showing that these systems generate intersectional effects. She uses this approach to develop a framework that can analyze gender inequalities across different nations and differentiates this from an approach (the one that Mohanty was referring to) which, one, paints national-level inequalities as the same and, two, differentiates only between the global North and South. This is manifested through the intersection of global dynamics like economics, migration, or violence, with regional dynamics, like histories of the nation or gendered inequalities in education and property education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BOSE|first=CHRISTINE E.|date=2012|title=Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality|journal=Gender and Society|volume=26|issue=1|pages=67\u201372|issn=0891-2432|jstor=23212241|doi=10.1177/0891243211426722}}</ref>\n\nThere is an issue globally with the way the law interacts with intersectionality, for example, the UK's legislation to protect workers rights has a distinct issue with intersectionality.

America is said to be one giant matrix of oppression, and its victims cannot fight their battles separately. They must all come together to fight their common enemy, the group that sits at the top of the pyramid of oppression: the straight, white, cis-gendered, able-bodied Christian or Jewish or possibly atheist male.

She has identified several ways in which the conventional theory has been destructive to the movement. She asserts that the common practice of using intersectionality to attack other ways of feminist thinking and the tendency of academics to critique intersectionality instead of using intersectionality as a tool to critique other conventional ways of thinking has been a misuse of the ideas it stands for. Tomlinson argues that in order to use intersectional theory correctly, intersectional feminists must not only consider the arguments but the tradition and mediums through which these arguments are made. Conventional academics are likely to favor writings by authors or publications with prior established credibility instead of looking at the quality of each piece individually, contributing to negative stereotypes associated with both feminism and intersectionality by having weaker arguments in defense of feminism and intersectionality become prominent based on renown. She goes on to argue that this allows critics of intersectionality to attack these weaker arguments, \"[reducing] intersectionality's radical critique of power to desires for identity and inclusion, and offer a deradicalized intersectionality as an asset for dominant disciplinary discourses\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Tomlinson | first = Barbara | title = To Tell the Truth and Not Get Trapped: Desire, Distance, and Intersectionality at the Scene of Argument | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 993\u20131017 | doi = 10.1086/669571 | date = Summer 2013 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\nSharon Goldman of the Israel-America Studies Program at Shalem College also criticized intersectionality on the basis of its being too simplistic. Goldman stipulates that many of the people championed by intersectionality truly are victims of oppression, but her reading of the ideology is that it favors the powerless over the powerful regardless of context. Any group that overcomes adversity, achieves independence, or defends itself successfully is seen as corrupt or imperialist by intersectionality adherents. The examples Goldman gives are American Jews who, inspired by the abject victimhood of [[the Holocaust]], engaged in politics to successfully advance their ideas into the American mainstream. American Jews are not given the benefit of the doubt by intersectionality adherents because they proudly reject victimization.<ref>Goldman, Sharon.

These intersection effects were based on studying the lenses of biases, heuristics, stereotypes, and judgments. Psychologists have extended research in psychological biases to the areas of cognitive and motivational psychology. What is found, is that every human mind has its own biases in judgment and decision-making that tend to preserve the status quo by avoiding change and attention to ideas that exist outside one's personal realm of perception.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorrell|first=Michael Gorrell|date=2011|title=E-books on EBSCOhost: Combining NetLibrary E-books with the EBSCOhost Platform|journal=Information Standards Quarterly|volume=23|issue=2|pages=31|doi=10.3789/isqv23n2.2011.07|issn=1041-0031|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2bf86c0ee1851b9cb678dee377f5f5045cb51ab9}}</ref> Psychological interaction effects span a range of variables, although person-by-situation effects are the most examined category. As a result, psychologists do not construe the interaction effect of demographics such as gender and race as either more noteworthy or less noteworthy than any other interaction effect. In addition, oppression can be regarded as a subjective construct when viewed as an absolute hierarchy. Even if an objective definition of oppression was reached, person-by-situation effects would make it difficult to deem certain persons or categories of persons as uniformly oppressed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name=\"DRItext\" />\n\nVitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (and humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]].

For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of [[dichlorophenolindophenol]] (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |title=Testing Foods for Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation |date=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123101705/http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |title=Measuring the Vitamin C content of foods and fruit juices |publisher=Nuffield Foundation |date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721181046/http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\nSimple tests are available to measure the levels of vitamin C in [[urine]] and [[serous fluid|serum]].<ref name=Carr2016 /><ref name=Schleicher2009 /> These better reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> It has been observed that while serum concentrations follow a [[circadian rhythm]] or reflect short-term dietary impact, content within cells or tissues is more stable and can give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the entire organism.

UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]].

This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

Briefly, his position was that for optimal health, humans should be consuming at least 2,300&nbsp;mg/day to compensate for the inability to synthesize vitamin C. The recommendation also fell into the consumption range for gorillas - a non-synthesizing near-relative to humans.<ref name=pmid5275366>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L | title = Evolution and the need for ascorbic acid | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 1643\u20138 | date = December 1970 | pmid = 5275366 | pmc = 283405 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.67.4.1643 | bibcode = 1970PNAS...67.1643P }}</ref> A second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter (\u00b5mol/L) once consumption exceeds 1,250 milligrams.<ref name=Mandl2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandl J, Szarka A, B\u00e1nhegyi G | title = Vitamin C: update on physiology and pharmacology | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 157 | issue = 7 | pages = 1097\u2013110 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19508394 | pmc = 2743829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00282.x }}</ref> As noted, government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110&nbsp;mg/day and normal plasma is approximately 50 \u00b5mol/L, so 'normal' is about 25% of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in the proposed megadose range.\n\nPauling popularized the concept of high dose vitamin C as prevention and treatment of the common cold in 1970.

The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]].

For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of [[dichlorophenolindophenol]] (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |title=Testing Foods for Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation |date=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123101705/http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |title=Measuring the Vitamin C content of foods and fruit juices |publisher=Nuffield Foundation |date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721181046/http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\nSimple tests are available to measure the levels of vitamin C in [[urine]] and [[serous fluid|serum]].<ref name=Carr2016 /><ref name=Schleicher2009 /> These better reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> It has been observed that while serum concentrations follow a [[circadian rhythm]] or reflect short-term dietary impact, content within cells or tissues is more stable and can give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the entire organism.

UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]].

This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

They relied almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality. The munition has been obsolete since the end of [[World War I]] for anti-personnel use, when it was superseded by [[shell (projectile)|high-explosive shells]] for that role. The functioning and principles behind Shrapnel shells are fundamentally different from high-explosive shell fragmentation. '''Shrapnel''' is named after Major-General [[Henry Shrapnel]] (1761\u20131842), a [[England|British]] [[artillery]] officer, whose [[experiment]]s, initially conducted on his own time and at his own expense, culminated in the [[design]] and development of a new type of [[artillery shell]].\n\nThe term \"shrapnel\" nowadays is often used to refer to lethal [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] of the casing of shells and bombs, though this usage strays from the original meaning of the word.<ref name=shrapneldef>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/shrapnel.htm|title=What is the difference between artillery shrapnel and shell fragments?|date=March 1952|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210123724/http://www.history.army.mil/faq/shrapnel.htm|archivedate=10 February 2017|journal=Combat Forces Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:12-pdrShrapnel.jpg|thumb|left|This engraving shows a 12-pounder U.S. shrapnel shell c. 1865. It is fitted with a Borman fuze. In the cutaway view, the dark grey is the wall of the shell, the medium grey is sulphur resin, the light grey are the musket balls, and the black is the bursting charge.]]\nIn 1784, Lieutenant Shrapnel of the [[Royal Artillery]] began developing an [[anti-personnel weapon]]. At the time artillery could use \"[[canister shot]]\" to defend themselves from [[infantry]] or [[cavalry]] attack, which involved loading a tin or canvas container filled with small iron or lead balls instead of the usual [[Round shot|cannonball]]. When fired, the container burst open during passage through the bore or at the muzzle, giving the effect of an oversized [[shotgun shell]]. At ranges of up to 300 m canister shot was still highly lethal, though at this range the shots\u2019 density was much lower, making a hit on a human body less likely. At longer ranges, solid shot or the common shell\u2014a hollow cast-iron sphere filled with [[gunpowder|black powder]]\u2014was used, although with more of a concussive than a fragmentation effect, as the pieces of the shell were very large and sparse in number.\n\nShrapnel's innovation was to combine the multi-projectile shotgun effect of canister shot, with a [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuze]] to open the canister and disperse the bullets it contained at some distance along the canister's trajectory from the gun.  His shell was a hollow cast-iron sphere filled with a mixture of balls and powder, with a crude time fuze. If the fuze was set correctly then the shell would break open, either in front of or above the intended human objective, releasing its contents (of [[musket]] balls). The shrapnel balls would carry on with the \"remaining velocity\" of the shell.  In addition to a denser pattern of musket balls, the retained velocity could be higher as well, since the shrapnel shell as a whole would likely have a higher [[ballistic coefficient]] than the individual musket balls (see [[external ballistics]]).\n\nThe explosive charge in the shell was to be just enough to break the casing rather than scatter the shot in all directions. As such his invention increased the effective range of canister shot from {{convert|300|m}} to about {{convert|1,100|m}}.\n\nHe called his device 'spherical case shot', but in time it came to be called after him; a  nomenclature formalised in 1852 by the British Government.\n\nInitial designs suffered from the potentially catastrophic problem that friction between the shot and black powder during the high acceleration down the gun bore could sometimes cause premature ignition of the powder. Various solutions were tried, with limited if any success.  However, in 1852 [[Edward Mounier Boxer|Colonel Boxer]] proposed using a diaphragm to separate the bullets from the bursting charge; this proved successful and was adopted the following year. As a buffer to prevent lead shot deforming, a resin was used as a packing material between the shot. A useful side effect of using the resin was that the combustion also gave a visual reference upon the shell bursting, as the resin shattered into a cloud of dust.\n\n== British artillery adoption ==\n[[File:Shrapnel&BoxerShellDesigns.jpg|thumb|right|Original Shrapnel design (left), and Boxer design of May 1852 which avoided premature explosions (right).]]\n[[File:RML 16 pounder shrapnel shell Mk III diagram.jpg|thumb|right|1870s [[cast-iron]] [[British ordnance terms#RML|RML]] 16-pounder \"Boxer\" shrapnel shell showing limited space for bullets.]]\n[[File:BL 5 inch shrapnel shells Mk III & Mk IV diagrams.jpg|thumb|right|[[Forging|Forged]] [[steel]] shrapnel shells for [[BL 5 inch gun Mk I - V|BL 5 inch gun]] with bursting charge in base (left), and in nose (right) for comparison, 1886.]]\nIt took until 1803 for the British artillery to adopt (albeit with great enthusiasm) the shrapnel shell (as \"spherical case\"). [[Henry Shrapnel]] was promoted to [[major]] in the same year. The first recorded use of shrapnel by the British was in 1804 against the Dutch at [[Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam]] in [[Suriname]].<ref>Hogg p. 180.</ref> [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]]'s armies used it from 1808 in the [[Peninsular War]] and at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he wrote admiringly of its effectiveness.\n\nThe design was improved by Captain [[Edward Mounier Boxer|E. M. Boxer]] of the [[Royal Arsenal]] around 1852 and crossed over when cylindrical shells for rifled guns were introduced. Lieutenant-Colonel Boxer adapted his design in 1864<ref>Marshall, 1920.</ref> to produce shrapnel shells for the new [[muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loader]] ([[British ordnance terms#RML|RML]]) guns: the walls were of thick [[cast iron]], but the gunpowder charge was now in the shell base with a tube running through the centre of the shell to convey the ignition flash from the [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuze]] in the nose to the gunpowder charge in the base. The powder charge both shattered the cast iron shell wall and liberated the bullets.<ref name=TOA1887page216/> The broken shell wall continued mainly forward but had little destructive effect. The system had major limitations: the thickness of the iron shell walls limited the available carrying capacity for bullets but provided little destructive capability, and the tube through the centre similarly reduced available space for bullets.<ref name=ToA1887>\"[[Treatise on Ammunition]]\", 4th Edition 1887, pp. 203-205.</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s [[William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] provided a design with the bursting charge in the head and the shell wall made of steel and hence much thinner than previous cast-iron shrapnel shell walls. While the thinner shell wall and absence of a central tube allowed the shell to carry far more bullets, it had the disadvantage that the bursting charge separated the bullets from the shell casing by firing the case forward and at the same time slowing the bullets down as they were ejected through the base of the shell casing, rather than increasing their velocity. Britain adopted this solution for several smaller calibres (below 6-inch)<ref name=ToA1887/> but by [[World War I]] few if any such shells remained.\n\nThe final shrapnel shell design, adopted in the 1880s, bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel's original design other than its spherical bullets and time fuse. It used a much thinner forged steel shell case with a timer fuse in the nose and a tube running through the centre to convey the ignition flash to a gunpowder bursting charge in the shell base. The use of steel allowed a thinner shell wall, allowing space for many more bullets. It also withstood the force of the powder charge without shattering, so that the bullets were fired forward out of the shell case with increased velocity, much like a shotgun. This design came to be adopted by all countries and was in standard use when [[World War I]] began in 1914. During the 1880s, when both the old cast-iron and modern forged-steel shrapnel shell designs were in British service, British ordnance manuals referred to the older cast-iron design as \"Boxer shrapnel\", apparently to differentiate it from the modern steel design.<ref name=TOA1887page216>\"The action of Boxer-shrapnel is well known. The fuze fires the primer, which conveys the flash down the pipe to the bursting charge, the explosion of which breaks up the shell, and liberates the balls\". [[Treatise on Ammunition]] 1887, p. 216.</ref>\n\nThe modern thin-walled forged-steel design made feasible shrapnel shells for howitzers, which had a much lower velocity than field guns, by using a larger gunpowder charge to accelerate the bullets forward on bursting.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Treatise on Ammunition]] 1887, p. 205.</ref> The ideal shrapnel design would have had a timer fuze in the shell base to avoid the need for a central tube, but this was not technically feasible due to the need to manually adjust the fuze before firing, and was in any case rejected from an early date by the British due to risk of premature ignition and irregular action.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==World War I era==\n[[File:Shrapnel (PSF).png|thumb|right|WWI shrapnel [[British ordnance terms#Round|round]]\n<br>1 Gunpowder bursting charge\n<br>2 Bullets\n<br>3 Time fuze\n<br>4 Ignition tube\n<br>5 Resin holding bullets in position\n<br>6 Steel shell wall\n<br>7 Cartridge case\n<br>8 Shell propellant]]\n\n===Technical considerations===\nThe size of shrapnel balls in World War I was based on two considerations.  One was the premise that a projectile energy of about {{convert|60|ftlbf|J|lk=on}} was required to disable an enemy soldier.<ref>Lt-Col. Ormond M Lissak, [https://archive.org/details/ordnancegunneryt00lissrich Ordnance and Gunnery. A Text-Book. New York: John Wiley, 1915. Page 446]</ref><ref>Treatise on Ammunition, 10th Edition, 1915. War Office, UK. Page 173.</ref> A typical World War I {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} field gun shell at its maximum possible range traveling at a velocity of 250 feet/second, plus the additional velocity from the shrapnel bursting charge (about 150 feet per second), would give individual shrapnel bullets a velocity of 400 feet per second and an energy of 60 foot-pounds (81 [[joule]]s): this was the minimum energy of a single half-inch lead-[[antimony]] ball of approximately {{convert|170|gr}}, or 41-42 balls = 1 pound.<ref group=note>Foot-pounds is calculated as wv\u00b2/2gc, where gc is the local acceleration of gravity, or 32.16 ft/second. Hence for the British calculation: 60 foot-pounds = 1/41 x v\u00b2/64.32 . Hence v\u00b2 = 60 x 64.32 x 41 . Hence v = 398 feet/second</ref> Hence this was a typical field gun shrapnel bullet size.\n\nThe maximum possible range, typically beyond {{convert|7,000|yards}}, was beyond useful shrapnel combat ranges for normal field guns due to loss of accuracy and the fact that at extreme range the projectiles descended relatively steeply and hence the \"cone\" of bullets covered a relatively small area.\n\nAt a more typical combat range of {{convert|3,000|yards}}, giving a fairly flat trajectory and hence a long \"[[Field of fire (weaponry)|beaten zone]]\" for the bullets, a typical 3-inch or 75-mm field gun shrapnel shell would have a velocity of approximately 900 feet/second. The bursting charge would add a possible 150 feet/second, giving a bullet velocity of 1,050 feet/second. This would give each bullet approximately 418 foot-pounds: seven times the assumed energy required to disable a man.\n: <math>1/41 \\times 1050^2/64.32 = 418 \\text{ foot-pounds}</math>\n\nFor larger guns which had lower velocities, correspondingly larger balls were used so that each individual ball carried enough energy to be lethal.\n\nMost engagements using guns in this size range used direct fire at enemy from {{convert|1,500|yards}} to {{convert|3,000|yards}} distant, at which ranges the residual shell velocity was correspondingly higher, as in the table - at least in the earlier stages of World War 1.\n\n[[File:US3inchShrapnelPatterns1915.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Trajectory and pattern of US {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} Shrapnel shell of WWI era.]]\nThe other factor was the trajectory.  The shrapnel bullets were typically lethal for about {{convert|300|yards}} from normal field guns after bursting and over {{convert|400|yards}} from heavy field guns.  To make maximum use of these distances a flat trajectory and hence high velocity gun was required. The pattern in Europe was that the armies with higher-velocity guns tended to use heavier bullets because they could afford to have fewer bullets per shell.<ref>Bethel p. 124.</ref>\n\nThe important points to note about shrapnel shells and bullets in their final stage of development in World War I are:\n*They used the property of carrying power, whereby if two projectiles are fired with the same velocity, then the heavier one goes farther. Bullets packed into a heavier carrier shell went farther than they would individually.\n*The shell body itself was not designed to be lethal: its sole function was to transport the bullets close to the target, and it fell to the ground intact after the bullets were released. A battlefield where a shrapnel barrage had been fired was afterwards typically littered with intact empty shell bodies, fuzes and central tubes. Troops under a shrapnel barrage would attempt to convey any of these intact fuzes they found to their own artillery units, as the time setting on the fuze could be used to calculate the shell's range and hence identify the firing gun's position, allowing it to be targeted in a counter-barrage.\n*They depended almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality: there was no lateral explosive effect.\n\nA firsthand description of successful British deployment of shrapnel in a defensive barrage during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], 1917: <blockquote>... the air is full of yellow spurts of smoke that burst about 30 feet up and shoot towards the earth - just ahead of each of these yellow puffs the earth rises in a lashed-up cloud - shrapnel - and how beautifully placed - long sweeps of it fly along that slope lashing up a good 200 yards of earth at each burst.<ref>Lieutenant Cyril Lawrence, 1st Field Company, Australian Engineers.

The nose fuze is not present in the sectioned round at top but is present in the complete round below. The tube through the centre of the shell is visible, which conveyed the ignition flash from the fuze to the small gunpowder charge in the cavity visible here in the base of the shell. This gunpowder charge then exploded and propelled the bullets out of the shell body through the nose.]]\nDuring the initial stages of [[World War I]], shrapnel was widely used by all sides as an anti-personnel weapon. It was the only type of shell available for British field guns ([[Ordnance QF 13 pounder|13-pounder]], [[Ordnance BLC 15 pounder|15 pounder]] and [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18-pounder]]) until October 1914. Shrapnel was effective against troops in the open, particularly massed infantry (advancing or withdrawing). However, the onset of [[trench warfare]] from late 1914 led to most armies decreasing their use of shrapnel in favour of high-explosive. Britain continued to use a high percentage of shrapnel shells. New tactical roles included cutting barbed wire and providing \"creeping barrages\" to both screen its own attacking troops and suppressing the enemy defenders to prevent them from shooting at their attackers.\n\nIn a creeping barrage fire was 'lifted' from one 'line' to the next as the attackers advanced.  These lines were typically {{convert|100|yard}} apart and the lifts were typically 4 minutes apart.  Lifting meant that [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuzes]] settings had to be changed. The attackers tried to keep as close as possible (as little as 25 yards sometimes) to the bursting shrapnel so as to be on top of the enemy trenches when fire lifted beyond them, and before the enemy could get back to their parapets.\n\n===Advantages===\nWhile shrapnel made no impression on trenches and other earthworks, it remained the favoured weapon of the British (at least) to support their infantry assaults by suppressing the enemy infantry and preventing them from manning their trench parapets. This was called 'neutralization' and by the second half of 1915 had become the primary task of artillery supporting an attack. Shrapnel was less hazardous to the assaulting British infantry than high explosives - as long as their own shrapnel burst above or ahead of them, attackers were safe from its effects, whereas [[high-explosive shell|high-explosive shells]] bursting short are potentially lethal within 100 yards or more in any direction.  Shrapnel was also useful against counter-attacks, working parties and any other troops in the open.\n\nBritish Expeditionary Force \"GHQ Artillery Notes No. 5 Wire-cutting\" was issued in June 1916.  It prescribed the use of shrapnel for wirecutting, with HE used to scatter the posts and wire when cut.  However, there were constraints: the best ranges for 18-pdrs were 1,800\u20132,400 yards.  Shorter ranges meant the flat trajectories might not clear the firers' own parapets, and fuzes could not be set for less than 1,000 yards.  The guns had to be overhauled by artificers and carefully calibrated.  Furthermore, they needed good platforms with trail and wheels anchored with sandbags, and an observing officer had to monitor the effects on the wire continuously and make any necessary adjustments to range and fuze settings.  These instructions were repeated in \"GHQ Artillery Notes No. 3 Artillery in Offensive Operations\", issued in February 1917 with added detail including the amount of ammunition required per yard of wire frontage.  The use of shrapnel for wire-cutting was also highlighted in RA \"Training Memoranda No. 2 1939\".\n\nShrapnel provided a useful \"screening\" effect from the smoke of the black-powder bursting charges when the British used it in \"creeping barrages\".\n\n===Disadvantages===\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the heavy casualties sustained by the British at the [[Battle of the Somme]] was the perceived belief that shrapnel would be effective at cutting the [[barbed wire]] entanglements in [[no man's land]] (although it has been suggested that the reason for the use of shrapnel as a wire-cutter at the Somme was because Britain lacked the capacity to manufacture enough HE shell<ref>Keegan, The Face of Battle</ref>). This perception was reinforced by the successful deployment of shrapnel shells against Germany's barbed wire entanglements in the 1915 [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], but the Germans thickened their barbed wire strands after that battle.  As a result, shrapnel was later only effective in killing enemy personnel; even if the conditions were correct, with the angle of descent being flat to maximise the number of bullets going through the entanglements, the probability of a shrapnel ball hitting a thin line of barbed wire and successfully cutting it was extremely low. The bullets also had limited destructive effect and were stopped by sandbags, so troops behind protection or in bunkers were generally safe. Additionally, steel helmets, including both the German [[Stahlhelm]] and the British [[Brodie helmet]], could resist Shrapnel bullets and protect the wearer from head injury:\n<blockquote>... suddenly, with a great clanging thud, I was hit on the forehead and knocked flying onto the floor of the trench... a shrapnel bullet had hit my helmet with great violence, without piercing it, but sufficiently hard to dent it. If I had, as had been usual up until a few days previously, been wearing a cap, then the Regiment would have had one more man killed.<ref>Reserve Lieutenant Walter Schulze of 8th Company Reserve Infantry Regiment 76, German Army, described his combat introduction to the Stahlhelm on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], 29 July 1916. Quoted in Sheldon, ''German Army on the Somme'', page 219. Sheldon quotes and translates from Gropp, ''History of IR 76'', p 159.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA shrapnel shell was more expensive than a high-explosive one{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and required higher grade steel for the shell body.  They were also harder to use correctly because getting the correct fuze running time was critical in order to burst the shell in the right place. This required considerable skill by the observation officer when engaging moving targets.\n\nAn added complication was that the actual fuze running time was affected by the meteorological conditions, with the variation in gun muzzle velocity being an added complication. However, the British used fuze indicators at each gun that determined the correct fuze running time (length) corrected for muzzle velocity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Replacement by high-explosive shell===\nWith the advent of relatively insensitive high explosives which could be used as the filling for shells, it was found that the casing of a properly designed [[high-explosive shell]] [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmented]] effectively {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. For example, the detonation of an average 105&nbsp;mm shell produces several thousand high-velocity (1,000 to 1,500&nbsp;m/s) fragments, a lethal (at very close range) blast overpressure and, if a surface or sub-surface burst, a useful cratering and anti-materiel effect \u2014 all in a munition much less complex than the later versions of the shrapnel shell. However, this fragmentation was often lost when shells penetrated soft ground, and because some fragments went in all directions it was a hazard to assaulting troops.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Variations===\nOne item of note is the \"universal shell\", a type of field gun shell developed by [[Krupp]] of Germany in the early 1900s. This shell could function as either a shrapnel shell or high explosive projectile. The shell had a modified fuze, and, instead of resin as the packing between the shrapnel balls, [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] was used. When a timed fuze was set the shell functioned as a shrapnel round, ejecting the balls and igniting (not detonating) the TNT, giving a visible puff of black smoke. When allowed to impact, the TNT filling would detonate, becoming a high-explosive shell with a very large amount of low-velocity fragmentation and a milder blast. Due to its complexity it was dropped in favour of a simple high-explosive shell.\n\nDuring World War I the UK also used shrapnel pattern shells to carry \"pots\" instead of \"bullets\".  These were incendiary shells with seven pots<ref>Hogg p. 173.</ref> using a [[thermite]] compound.\n\nWhen World War I began the United States also had what it referred to as the \"Ehrhardt high-explosive shrapnel\" in its inventory.<ref>E.L. Gruber, [https://archive.org/details/noteson3inchgunm00grubrich \"Notes on the 3 inch gun materiel and field artillery equipment\"]. New Haven Print. Co., 1917</ref> It appears to be similar to the German design, with bullets embedded in TNT rather than resin, together with a quantity of explosive in the shell nose. Douglas Hamilton mentions this shell type in passing, as \"not as common as other types\" in his comprehensive treatises on manufacturing shrapnel<ref>Douglas T Hamilton, [https://archive.org/details/shrapnelshellman00hamirich \"Shrapnel Shell Manufacture. A Comprehensive Treatise\". New York: Industrial Press, 1915]</ref> and high explosive shells<ref>Douglas T Hamilton, [https://archive.org/details/highexplosiveshe00hamirich \"High-explosive shell manufacture; a comprehensive treatise\".  New York: Industrial Press, 1916]</ref> of 1915 and 1916, but gives no manufacturing details. Nor does Ethan Viall in 1917.<ref>Ethan Viall, [https://archive.org/details/unitedstatesarti00vialrich \"United States artillery ammunition; 3 to 6 in. shrapnel shells, 3 to 6 in. high explosive shells and their cartridge cases\"]. New York, McGraw-Hill book company, 1917.</ref> Hence the US appears to have ceased its manufacture early in the war, presumably based on the experience of other combatants.\n\n==World War II era==\n[[File:Rus122shrapnel.JPG|thumb|Russian 122 mm shrapnel shell]]\nA new British streamlined shrapnel shell, Mk 3D, had been developed for [[BL 60 pounder gun]] in the early 1930s, containing 760 bullets. There was some use of shrapnel by the British in the campaigns in East and North East Africa at the beginning of the war, where 18-pdr and 4.5-in (114&nbsp;mm) howitzers were used.  By [[World War II]] shrapnel shells, in the strict sense of the word, fell out of use, the last recorded use of shrapnel being 60 pdr shells fired in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] in 1943.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  In 1945 the British conducted successful trials with shrapnel shells fuzed with [[Proximity fuze|VT]]. However, shrapnel was not developed for any of the post World War I guns.{{clarify|date=August 2011|worldwide or UK only?}}\n\n==Vietnam War era==\nAlthough not strictly shrapnel, a 1960s weapons project produced splintex shells for 90 and 106&nbsp;mm recoilless rifles and 105&nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s where it was called a \"[[Beehive anti-personnel round|beehive]]\" round. Unlike the shrapnel shells\u2019 balls, the splintex shells contained [[flechette]]s. The result was the 105&nbsp;mm M546 APERS-T (anti-personnel-tracer) round, first used in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1966. The shell consisted of approximately 8,000 one-half gram flechettes arranged in five tiers, a time fuze, body shearing detonators, a central flash tube, a smokeless propellant charge with a dye marker contained in the base and a tracer element. The shell functioned as follows: the time fuze fired, the flash traveled down the flash tube, the shearing detonators fired, and the forward body split into four pieces. The body and first four tiers were dispersed by the projectile's spin, the last tier and visual marker by the powder charge itself. The flechettes spread, mainly due to spin, from the point of burst in an ever-widening cone along the projectile's previous trajectory prior to bursting. The round was complex to make, but is a highly effective anti-personnel weapon &mdash; soldiers reported that after beehive rounds were fired during an overrun attack, many enemy dead had their hands nailed to the wooden stocks of their rifles, and these dead could be dragged to mass graves by the rifle. It is said that the name beehive was given to the munition type due to the noise of the flechettes moving through the air resembling that of a swarm of bees.\n\n==Modern era==\nThough shrapnel rounds are now rarely used, apart from the beehive munitions, there are other modern rounds, that use, or have used, the shrapnel principle. The DM 111 20&nbsp;mm cannon round used for close range air defense, the flechette-filled 40&nbsp;mm HVCC (40 x 53&nbsp;mm HV grenade), the 35&nbsp;mm cannon (35 \u00d7 228&nbsp;mm) AHEAD ammunition (152 x 3.3 g tungsten cylinders), RWM Schweiz 30 \u00d7 173&nbsp;mm air-bursting munition, five-inch shotgun projectile (KE-ET) and possibly more. Also, many modern armies have canister shot ammunition for tank and artillery guns, the XM1028 round for the 120&nbsp;mm M256 tank gun being one example (approx 1150 tungsten balls at 1,400&nbsp;m/s).\n\nAt least some [[anti-ballistic missile]]s (ABMs) use shrapnel-like warheads instead of the more common{{Citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=ABMs are nowadays hit-to-kill, except for the Russian system. With ICBM hit by blast/frag, it would be quite impossible to determine if it has been actually disabled.}} blast-fragmentation types. As with a blast-frag warhead, the use of this type of warhead does not require a direct body-on-body impact, so greatly reduces tracking and steering accuracy requirements. At a predetermined distance from the incoming [[re-entry vehicle]] (RV) the warhead releases, in the case of the ABM warhead by an explosive expulsion charge, an array of mainly rod-like sub-projectiles into the RV's flight path. Unlike a blast-frag warhead, the expulsion charge is only needed to release the sub-projectiles from the main warhead, not to accelerate them to high velocity. The velocity required to penetrate the RV's casing comes from the high terminal velocity of the warhead, similar to the shrapnel shell's principle. The reason for the use of this type of warhead and not a blast-frag is that the fragments produced by a blast-frag warhead cannot guarantee penetration of the RV's casing. By using rod-like sub-projectiles, a much greater thickness of material can be penetrated, greatly increasing the potential for disruption of the incoming RV.\n\nThe [[Starstreak missile]] uses a similar system, with three metal darts splitting from the missile prior to impact, although in the case of Starstreak these darts are [[missile guidance|guided]].\n\n==Gallery of images==\n<gallery>\nFile:USRussianGermanFrenchBritShrapnelShells.jpg|US, Russian, German, French & British WWI Shrapnel rounds compared\nFile:18pdrShrapnelDiagram1.jpg|British 18-pounder shrapnel shell, WWI\nFile:Bille Shrapnel surface et profondeur Verdun.jpg|Shrapnel ball from WWI recovered at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]\nFile:Empty shells Sanctuary Wood Museum Flickr 5086309295 73cff176d9 o.jpg|Empty fired shrapnel shells at Sanctuary Wood, Belgium\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of cannon projectiles]]\n*[[Claymore mine]]\n*[[Continuous-rod warhead]]\n*[[Grape shot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bethel, HA. 1911.

They relied almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality. The munition has been obsolete since the end of [[World War I]] for anti-personnel use, when it was superseded by [[shell (projectile)|high-explosive shells]] for that role. The functioning and principles behind Shrapnel shells are fundamentally different from high-explosive shell fragmentation. '''Shrapnel''' is named after Major-General [[Henry Shrapnel]] (1761\u20131842), a [[England|British]] [[artillery]] officer, whose [[experiment]]s, initially conducted on his own time and at his own expense, culminated in the [[design]] and development of a new type of [[artillery shell]].\n\nThe term \"shrapnel\" nowadays is often used to refer to lethal [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] of the casing of shells and bombs, though this usage strays from the original meaning of the word.<ref name=shrapneldef>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/shrapnel.htm|title=What is the difference between artillery shrapnel and shell fragments?|date=March 1952|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210123724/http://www.history.army.mil/faq/shrapnel.htm|archivedate=10 February 2017|journal=Combat Forces Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:12-pdrShrapnel.jpg|thumb|left|This engraving shows a 12-pounder U.S. shrapnel shell c. 1865. It is fitted with a Borman fuze. In the cutaway view, the dark grey is the wall of the shell, the medium grey is sulphur resin, the light grey are the musket balls, and the black is the bursting charge.]]\nIn 1784, Lieutenant Shrapnel of the [[Royal Artillery]] began developing an [[anti-personnel weapon]]. At the time artillery could use \"[[canister shot]]\" to defend themselves from [[infantry]] or [[cavalry]] attack, which involved loading a tin or canvas container filled with small iron or lead balls instead of the usual [[Round shot|cannonball]]. When fired, the container burst open during passage through the bore or at the muzzle, giving the effect of an oversized [[shotgun shell]]. At ranges of up to 300 m canister shot was still highly lethal, though at this range the shots\u2019 density was much lower, making a hit on a human body less likely. At longer ranges, solid shot or the common shell\u2014a hollow cast-iron sphere filled with [[gunpowder|black powder]]\u2014was used, although with more of a concussive than a fragmentation effect, as the pieces of the shell were very large and sparse in number.\n\nShrapnel's innovation was to combine the multi-projectile shotgun effect of canister shot, with a [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuze]] to open the canister and disperse the bullets it contained at some distance along the canister's trajectory from the gun.  His shell was a hollow cast-iron sphere filled with a mixture of balls and powder, with a crude time fuze. If the fuze was set correctly then the shell would break open, either in front of or above the intended human objective, releasing its contents (of [[musket]] balls). The shrapnel balls would carry on with the \"remaining velocity\" of the shell.  In addition to a denser pattern of musket balls, the retained velocity could be higher as well, since the shrapnel shell as a whole would likely have a higher [[ballistic coefficient]] than the individual musket balls (see [[external ballistics]]).\n\nThe explosive charge in the shell was to be just enough to break the casing rather than scatter the shot in all directions. As such his invention increased the effective range of canister shot from {{convert|300|m}} to about {{convert|1,100|m}}.\n\nHe called his device 'spherical case shot', but in time it came to be called after him; a  nomenclature formalised in 1852 by the British Government.\n\nInitial designs suffered from the potentially catastrophic problem that friction between the shot and black powder during the high acceleration down the gun bore could sometimes cause premature ignition of the powder. Various solutions were tried, with limited if any success.  However, in 1852 [[Edward Mounier Boxer|Colonel Boxer]] proposed using a diaphragm to separate the bullets from the bursting charge; this proved successful and was adopted the following year. As a buffer to prevent lead shot deforming, a resin was used as a packing material between the shot. A useful side effect of using the resin was that the combustion also gave a visual reference upon the shell bursting, as the resin shattered into a cloud of dust.\n\n== British artillery adoption ==\n[[File:Shrapnel&BoxerShellDesigns.jpg|thumb|right|Original Shrapnel design (left), and Boxer design of May 1852 which avoided premature explosions (right).]]\n[[File:RML 16 pounder shrapnel shell Mk III diagram.jpg|thumb|right|1870s [[cast-iron]] [[British ordnance terms#RML|RML]] 16-pounder \"Boxer\" shrapnel shell showing limited space for bullets.]]\n[[File:BL 5 inch shrapnel shells Mk III & Mk IV diagrams.jpg|thumb|right|[[Forging|Forged]] [[steel]] shrapnel shells for [[BL 5 inch gun Mk I - V|BL 5 inch gun]] with bursting charge in base (left), and in nose (right) for comparison, 1886.]]\nIt took until 1803 for the British artillery to adopt (albeit with great enthusiasm) the shrapnel shell (as \"spherical case\"). [[Henry Shrapnel]] was promoted to [[major]] in the same year. The first recorded use of shrapnel by the British was in 1804 against the Dutch at [[Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam]] in [[Suriname]].<ref>Hogg p. 180.</ref> [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|The Duke of Wellington]]'s armies used it from 1808 in the [[Peninsular War]] and at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he wrote admiringly of its effectiveness.\n\nThe design was improved by Captain [[Edward Mounier Boxer|E. M. Boxer]] of the [[Royal Arsenal]] around 1852 and crossed over when cylindrical shells for rifled guns were introduced. Lieutenant-Colonel Boxer adapted his design in 1864<ref>Marshall, 1920.</ref> to produce shrapnel shells for the new [[muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loader]] ([[British ordnance terms#RML|RML]]) guns: the walls were of thick [[cast iron]], but the gunpowder charge was now in the shell base with a tube running through the centre of the shell to convey the ignition flash from the [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuze]] in the nose to the gunpowder charge in the base. The powder charge both shattered the cast iron shell wall and liberated the bullets.<ref name=TOA1887page216/> The broken shell wall continued mainly forward but had little destructive effect. The system had major limitations: the thickness of the iron shell walls limited the available carrying capacity for bullets but provided little destructive capability, and the tube through the centre similarly reduced available space for bullets.<ref name=ToA1887>\"[[Treatise on Ammunition]]\", 4th Edition 1887, pp. 203-205.</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s [[William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] provided a design with the bursting charge in the head and the shell wall made of steel and hence much thinner than previous cast-iron shrapnel shell walls. While the thinner shell wall and absence of a central tube allowed the shell to carry far more bullets, it had the disadvantage that the bursting charge separated the bullets from the shell casing by firing the case forward and at the same time slowing the bullets down as they were ejected through the base of the shell casing, rather than increasing their velocity. Britain adopted this solution for several smaller calibres (below 6-inch)<ref name=ToA1887/> but by [[World War I]] few if any such shells remained.\n\nThe final shrapnel shell design, adopted in the 1880s, bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel's original design other than its spherical bullets and time fuse. It used a much thinner forged steel shell case with a timer fuse in the nose and a tube running through the centre to convey the ignition flash to a gunpowder bursting charge in the shell base. The use of steel allowed a thinner shell wall, allowing space for many more bullets. It also withstood the force of the powder charge without shattering, so that the bullets were fired forward out of the shell case with increased velocity, much like a shotgun. This design came to be adopted by all countries and was in standard use when [[World War I]] began in 1914. During the 1880s, when both the old cast-iron and modern forged-steel shrapnel shell designs were in British service, British ordnance manuals referred to the older cast-iron design as \"Boxer shrapnel\", apparently to differentiate it from the modern steel design.<ref name=TOA1887page216>\"The action of Boxer-shrapnel is well known. The fuze fires the primer, which conveys the flash down the pipe to the bursting charge, the explosion of which breaks up the shell, and liberates the balls\". [[Treatise on Ammunition]] 1887, p. 216.</ref>\n\nThe modern thin-walled forged-steel design made feasible shrapnel shells for howitzers, which had a much lower velocity than field guns, by using a larger gunpowder charge to accelerate the bullets forward on bursting.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Treatise on Ammunition]] 1887, p. 205.</ref> The ideal shrapnel design would have had a timer fuze in the shell base to avoid the need for a central tube, but this was not technically feasible due to the need to manually adjust the fuze before firing, and was in any case rejected from an early date by the British due to risk of premature ignition and irregular action.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==World War I era==\n[[File:Shrapnel (PSF).png|thumb|right|WWI shrapnel [[British ordnance terms#Round|round]]\n<br>1 Gunpowder bursting charge\n<br>2 Bullets\n<br>3 Time fuze\n<br>4 Ignition tube\n<br>5 Resin holding bullets in position\n<br>6 Steel shell wall\n<br>7 Cartridge case\n<br>8 Shell propellant]]\n\n===Technical considerations===\nThe size of shrapnel balls in World War I was based on two considerations.  One was the premise that a projectile energy of about {{convert|60|ftlbf|J|lk=on}} was required to disable an enemy soldier.<ref>Lt-Col. Ormond M Lissak, [https://archive.org/details/ordnancegunneryt00lissrich Ordnance and Gunnery. A Text-Book. New York: John Wiley, 1915. Page 446]</ref><ref>Treatise on Ammunition, 10th Edition, 1915. War Office, UK. Page 173.</ref> A typical World War I {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} field gun shell at its maximum possible range traveling at a velocity of 250 feet/second, plus the additional velocity from the shrapnel bursting charge (about 150 feet per second), would give individual shrapnel bullets a velocity of 400 feet per second and an energy of 60 foot-pounds (81 [[joule]]s): this was the minimum energy of a single half-inch lead-[[antimony]] ball of approximately {{convert|170|gr}}, or 41-42 balls = 1 pound.<ref group=note>Foot-pounds is calculated as wv\u00b2/2gc, where gc is the local acceleration of gravity, or 32.16 ft/second. Hence for the British calculation: 60 foot-pounds = 1/41 x v\u00b2/64.32 . Hence v\u00b2 = 60 x 64.32 x 41 . Hence v = 398 feet/second</ref> Hence this was a typical field gun shrapnel bullet size.\n\nThe maximum possible range, typically beyond {{convert|7,000|yards}}, was beyond useful shrapnel combat ranges for normal field guns due to loss of accuracy and the fact that at extreme range the projectiles descended relatively steeply and hence the \"cone\" of bullets covered a relatively small area.\n\nAt a more typical combat range of {{convert|3,000|yards}}, giving a fairly flat trajectory and hence a long \"[[Field of fire (weaponry)|beaten zone]]\" for the bullets, a typical 3-inch or 75-mm field gun shrapnel shell would have a velocity of approximately 900 feet/second. The bursting charge would add a possible 150 feet/second, giving a bullet velocity of 1,050 feet/second. This would give each bullet approximately 418 foot-pounds: seven times the assumed energy required to disable a man.\n: <math>1/41 \\times 1050^2/64.32 = 418 \\text{ foot-pounds}</math>\n\nFor larger guns which had lower velocities, correspondingly larger balls were used so that each individual ball carried enough energy to be lethal.\n\nMost engagements using guns in this size range used direct fire at enemy from {{convert|1,500|yards}} to {{convert|3,000|yards}} distant, at which ranges the residual shell velocity was correspondingly higher, as in the table - at least in the earlier stages of World War 1.\n\n[[File:US3inchShrapnelPatterns1915.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Trajectory and pattern of US {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} Shrapnel shell of WWI era.]]\nThe other factor was the trajectory.  The shrapnel bullets were typically lethal for about {{convert|300|yards}} from normal field guns after bursting and over {{convert|400|yards}} from heavy field guns.  To make maximum use of these distances a flat trajectory and hence high velocity gun was required. The pattern in Europe was that the armies with higher-velocity guns tended to use heavier bullets because they could afford to have fewer bullets per shell.<ref>Bethel p. 124.</ref>\n\nThe important points to note about shrapnel shells and bullets in their final stage of development in World War I are:\n*They used the property of carrying power, whereby if two projectiles are fired with the same velocity, then the heavier one goes farther. Bullets packed into a heavier carrier shell went farther than they would individually.\n*The shell body itself was not designed to be lethal: its sole function was to transport the bullets close to the target, and it fell to the ground intact after the bullets were released. A battlefield where a shrapnel barrage had been fired was afterwards typically littered with intact empty shell bodies, fuzes and central tubes. Troops under a shrapnel barrage would attempt to convey any of these intact fuzes they found to their own artillery units, as the time setting on the fuze could be used to calculate the shell's range and hence identify the firing gun's position, allowing it to be targeted in a counter-barrage.\n*They depended almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality: there was no lateral explosive effect.\n\nA firsthand description of successful British deployment of shrapnel in a defensive barrage during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], 1917: <blockquote>... the air is full of yellow spurts of smoke that burst about 30 feet up and shoot towards the earth - just ahead of each of these yellow puffs the earth rises in a lashed-up cloud - shrapnel - and how beautifully placed - long sweeps of it fly along that slope lashing up a good 200 yards of earth at each burst.<ref>Lieutenant Cyril Lawrence, 1st Field Company, Australian Engineers.

The nose fuze is not present in the sectioned round at top but is present in the complete round below. The tube through the centre of the shell is visible, which conveyed the ignition flash from the fuze to the small gunpowder charge in the cavity visible here in the base of the shell. This gunpowder charge then exploded and propelled the bullets out of the shell body through the nose.]]\nDuring the initial stages of [[World War I]], shrapnel was widely used by all sides as an anti-personnel weapon. It was the only type of shell available for British field guns ([[Ordnance QF 13 pounder|13-pounder]], [[Ordnance BLC 15 pounder|15 pounder]] and [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18-pounder]]) until October 1914. Shrapnel was effective against troops in the open, particularly massed infantry (advancing or withdrawing). However, the onset of [[trench warfare]] from late 1914 led to most armies decreasing their use of shrapnel in favour of high-explosive. Britain continued to use a high percentage of shrapnel shells. New tactical roles included cutting barbed wire and providing \"creeping barrages\" to both screen its own attacking troops and suppressing the enemy defenders to prevent them from shooting at their attackers.\n\nIn a creeping barrage fire was 'lifted' from one 'line' to the next as the attackers advanced.  These lines were typically {{convert|100|yard}} apart and the lifts were typically 4 minutes apart.  Lifting meant that [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|time fuzes]] settings had to be changed. The attackers tried to keep as close as possible (as little as 25 yards sometimes) to the bursting shrapnel so as to be on top of the enemy trenches when fire lifted beyond them, and before the enemy could get back to their parapets.\n\n===Advantages===\nWhile shrapnel made no impression on trenches and other earthworks, it remained the favoured weapon of the British (at least) to support their infantry assaults by suppressing the enemy infantry and preventing them from manning their trench parapets. This was called 'neutralization' and by the second half of 1915 had become the primary task of artillery supporting an attack. Shrapnel was less hazardous to the assaulting British infantry than high explosives - as long as their own shrapnel burst above or ahead of them, attackers were safe from its effects, whereas [[high-explosive shell|high-explosive shells]] bursting short are potentially lethal within 100 yards or more in any direction.  Shrapnel was also useful against counter-attacks, working parties and any other troops in the open.\n\nBritish Expeditionary Force \"GHQ Artillery Notes No. 5 Wire-cutting\" was issued in June 1916.  It prescribed the use of shrapnel for wirecutting, with HE used to scatter the posts and wire when cut.  However, there were constraints: the best ranges for 18-pdrs were 1,800\u20132,400 yards.  Shorter ranges meant the flat trajectories might not clear the firers' own parapets, and fuzes could not be set for less than 1,000 yards.  The guns had to be overhauled by artificers and carefully calibrated.  Furthermore, they needed good platforms with trail and wheels anchored with sandbags, and an observing officer had to monitor the effects on the wire continuously and make any necessary adjustments to range and fuze settings.  These instructions were repeated in \"GHQ Artillery Notes No. 3 Artillery in Offensive Operations\", issued in February 1917 with added detail including the amount of ammunition required per yard of wire frontage.  The use of shrapnel for wire-cutting was also highlighted in RA \"Training Memoranda No. 2 1939\".\n\nShrapnel provided a useful \"screening\" effect from the smoke of the black-powder bursting charges when the British used it in \"creeping barrages\".\n\n===Disadvantages===\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the heavy casualties sustained by the British at the [[Battle of the Somme]] was the perceived belief that shrapnel would be effective at cutting the [[barbed wire]] entanglements in [[no man's land]] (although it has been suggested that the reason for the use of shrapnel as a wire-cutter at the Somme was because Britain lacked the capacity to manufacture enough HE shell)<ref>Keegan, The Face of Battle</ref>). This perception was reinforced by the successful deployment of shrapnel shells against Germany's barbed wire entanglements in the 1915 [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], but the Germans thickened their barbed wire strands after that battle.  As a result, shrapnel was later only effective in killing enemy personnel; even if the conditions were correct, with the angle of descent being flat to maximise the number of bullets going through the entanglements, the probability of a shrapnel ball hitting a thin line of barbed wire and successfully cutting it was extremely low. The bullets also had limited destructive effect and were stopped by sandbags, so troops behind protection or in bunkers were generally safe. Also steel helmets, both the German [[Stahlhelm]] and the British [[Brodie helmet]], could resist Shrapnel bullets and protect the wearer from head injury:\n<blockquote>... suddenly, with a great clanging thud, I was hit on the forehead and knocked flying onto the floor of the trench... a shrapnel bullet had hit my helmet with great violence, without piercing it, but sufficiently hard to dent it. If I had, as had been usual up until a few days previously, been wearing a cap, then the Regiment would have had one more man killed.<ref>Reserve Lieutenant Walter Schulze of 8th Company Reserve Infantry Regiment 76, German Army, described his combat introduction to the Stahlhelm on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], 29 July 1916. Quoted in Sheldon, ''German Army on the Somme'', page 219. Sheldon quotes and translates from Gropp, ''History of IR 76'', p 159.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA shrapnel shell was more expensive than a high-explosive one{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} and required higher grade steel for the shell body.  They were also harder to use correctly because getting the correct fuze running time was critical in order to burst the shell in the right place. This required considerable skill by the observation officer when engaging moving targets.\n\nAn added complication was that the actual fuze running time was affected by the meteorological conditions, with the variation in gun muzzle velocity being an added complication. However, the British used fuze indicators at each gun that determined the correct fuze running time (length) corrected for muzzle velocity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Replacement by high-explosive shell===\nWith the advent of relatively insensitive high explosives which could be used as the filling for shells, it was found that the casing of a properly designed [[high-explosive shell]] [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmented]] effectively {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. For example, the detonation of an average 105&nbsp;mm shell produces several thousand high-velocity (1,000 to 1,500&nbsp;m/s) fragments, a lethal (at very close range) blast overpressure and, if a surface or sub-surface burst, a useful cratering and anti-materiel effect \u2014 all in a munition much less complex than the later versions of the shrapnel shell. However, this fragmentation was often lost when shells penetrated soft ground, and because some fragments went in all directions it was a hazard to assaulting troops.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Variations===\nOne item of note is the \"universal shell\", a type of field gun shell developed by [[Krupp]] of Germany in the early 1900s. This shell could function as either a shrapnel shell or high explosive projectile. The shell had a modified fuze, and, instead of resin as the packing between the shrapnel balls, [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] was used. When a timed fuze was set the shell functioned as a shrapnel round, ejecting the balls and igniting (not detonating) the TNT, giving a visible puff of black smoke. When allowed to impact, the TNT filling would detonate, becoming a high-explosive shell with a very large amount of low-velocity fragmentation and a milder blast. Due to its complexity it was dropped in favour of a simple high-explosive shell.\n\nDuring World War I the UK also used shrapnel pattern shells to carry \"pots\" instead of \"bullets\".  These were incendiary shells with seven pots<ref>Hogg p. 173.</ref> using a [[thermite]] compound.\n\nWhen World War I began the United States also had what it referred to as the \"Ehrhardt high-explosive shrapnel\" in its inventory.<ref>E.L. Gruber, [https://archive.org/details/noteson3inchgunm00grubrich \"Notes on the 3 inch gun materiel and field artillery equipment\"]. New Haven Print. Co., 1917</ref> It appears to be similar to the German design, with bullets embedded in TNT rather than resin, together with a quantity of explosive in the shell nose. Douglas Hamilton mentions this shell type in passing, as \"not as common as other types\" in his comprehensive treatises on manufacturing shrapnel<ref>Douglas T Hamilton, [https://archive.org/details/shrapnelshellman00hamirich \"Shrapnel Shell Manufacture. A Comprehensive Treatise\". New York: Industrial Press, 1915]</ref> and high explosive shells<ref>Douglas T Hamilton, [https://archive.org/details/highexplosiveshe00hamirich \"High-explosive shell manufacture; a comprehensive treatise\".  New York: Industrial Press, 1916]</ref> of 1915 and 1916, but gives no manufacturing details. Nor does Ethan Viall in 1917.<ref>Ethan Viall, [https://archive.org/details/unitedstatesarti00vialrich \"United States artillery ammunition; 3 to 6 in. shrapnel shells, 3 to 6 in. high explosive shells and their cartridge cases\"]. New York, McGraw-Hill book company, 1917.</ref> Hence the US appears to have ceased its manufacture early in the war, presumably based on the experience of other combatants.\n\n==World War II era==\n[[File:Rus122shrapnel.JPG|thumb|Russian 122 mm shrapnel shell]]\nA new British streamlined shrapnel shell, Mk 3D, had been developed for [[BL 60 pounder gun]] in the early 1930s, containing 760 bullets. There was some use of shrapnel by the British in the campaigns in East and North East Africa at the beginning of the war, where 18-pdr and 4.5-in (114&nbsp;mm) howitzers were used.  By [[World War II]] shrapnel shells, in the strict sense of the word, fell out of use, the last recorded use of shrapnel being 60 pdr shells fired in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] in 1943.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  In 1945 the British conducted successful trials with shrapnel shells fuzed with [[Proximity fuze|VT]]. However, shrapnel was not developed for any of the post World War I guns.{{clarify|date=August 2011|worldwide or UK only?}}\n\n==Vietnam War era==\nAlthough not strictly shrapnel, a 1960s weapons project produced splintex shells for 90 and 106&nbsp;mm recoilless rifles and 105&nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s where it was called a \"[[Beehive anti-personnel round|beehive]]\" round. Unlike the shrapnel shells\u2019 balls, the splintex shells contained [[flechette]]s. The result was the 105&nbsp;mm M546 APERS-T (anti-personnel-tracer) round, first used in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1966. The shell consisted of approximately 8,000 one-half gram flechettes arranged in five tiers, a time fuze, body shearing detonators, a central flash tube, a smokeless propellant charge with a dye marker contained in the base and a tracer element. The shell functioned as follows: the time fuze fired, the flash traveled down the flash tube, the shearing detonators fired, and the forward body split into four pieces. The body and first four tiers were dispersed by the projectile's spin, the last tier and visual marker by the powder charge itself. The flechettes spread, mainly due to spin, from the point of burst in an ever-widening cone along the projectile's previous trajectory prior to bursting. The round was complex to make, but is a highly effective anti-personnel weapon &mdash; soldiers reported that after beehive rounds were fired during an overrun attack, many enemy dead had their hands nailed to the wooden stocks of their rifles, and these dead could be dragged to mass graves by the rifle. It is said that the name beehive was given to the munition type due to the noise of the flechettes moving through the air resembling that of a swarm of bees.\n\n==Modern era==\nThough shrapnel rounds are now rarely used, apart from the beehive munitions, there are other modern rounds, that use, or have used, the shrapnel principle. The DM 111 20&nbsp;mm cannon round used for close range air defense, the flechette-filled 40&nbsp;mm HVCC (40 x 53&nbsp;mm HV grenade), the 35&nbsp;mm cannon (35 \u00d7 228&nbsp;mm) AHEAD ammunition (152 x 3.3 g tungsten cylinders), RWM Schweiz 30 \u00d7 173&nbsp;mm air-bursting munition, five-inch shotgun projectile (KE-ET) and possibly more. Also, many modern armies have canister shot ammunition for tank and artillery guns, the XM1028 round for the 120&nbsp;mm M256 tank gun being one example (approx 1150 tungsten balls at 1,400&nbsp;m/s).\n\nAt least some [[anti-ballistic missile]]s (ABMs) use shrapnel-like warheads instead of the more common{{Citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=ABMs are nowadays hit-to-kill, except for the Russian system. With ICBM hit by blast/frag, it would be quite impossible to determine if it has been actually disabled.}} blast-fragmentation types. As with a blast-frag warhead, the use of this type of warhead does not require a direct body-on-body impact, so greatly reduces tracking and steering accuracy requirements. At a predetermined distance from the incoming [[re-entry vehicle]] (RV) the warhead releases, in the case of the ABM warhead by an explosive expulsion charge, an array of mainly rod-like sub-projectiles into the RV's flight path. Unlike a blast-frag warhead, the expulsion charge is only needed to release the sub-projectiles from the main warhead, not to accelerate them to high velocity. The velocity required to penetrate the RV's casing comes from the high terminal velocity of the warhead, similar to the shrapnel shell's principle. The reason for the use of this type of warhead and not a blast-frag is that the fragments produced by a blast-frag warhead cannot guarantee penetration of the RV's casing. By using rod-like sub-projectiles, a much greater thickness of material can be penetrated, greatly increasing the potential for disruption of the incoming RV.\n\nThe [[Starstreak missile]] uses a similar system, with three metal darts splitting from the missile prior to impact, although in the case of Starstreak these darts are [[missile guidance|guided]].\n\n==Gallery of images==\n<gallery>\nFile:USRussianGermanFrenchBritShrapnelShells.jpg|US, Russian, German, French & British WWI Shrapnel rounds compared\nFile:18pdrShrapnelDiagram1.jpg|British 18-pounder shrapnel shell, WWI\nFile:Bille Shrapnel surface et profondeur Verdun.jpg|Shrapnel ball from WWI recovered at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]\nFile:Empty shells Sanctuary Wood Museum Flickr 5086309295 73cff176d9 o.jpg|Empty fired shrapnel shells at Sanctuary Wood, Belgium\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of cannon projectiles]]\n*[[Claymore mine]]\n*[[Continuous-rod warhead]]\n*[[Grape shot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bethel, HA. 1911.
