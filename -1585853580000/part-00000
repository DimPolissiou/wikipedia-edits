Two of Robin's songs, \"Embrace\" and \"Promise The Earth\" are [[Europop]] dance songs, while Barry's \"Technicolor Dreams\" is an exception to the rule, as it is an homage to the typical 1930s [[Tin Pan Alley]] melody. Maurice Gibb provides lead vocals for two songs, \"Man in the Middle\" and \"Walking on Air\".<ref name=\":0\" /> In the United Kingdom, two bonus tracks were published, \"Just in Case\" and \"Promise the Earth\" as well as other countries issued the album with 14 tracks.<ref name=\"records\"/>\n\n===Recording===\nOne song in the album, \"Sacred Trust\" was recorded in early 1998 in [[Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/98.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1998 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> Around 1999, the Bee Gees recorded \"I Will Be There\" but only as a demo as they sent it to [[Tina Turner]] and she recorded it for her album ''[[Twenty Four Seven (Tina Turner album)|Twenty Four Seven]]'' that same year.

Also in 1999, three new Barry Gibb compositions \"Technicolor Dreams\", \"Loose Talk Costs Lives\" and \"Voice in the Wilderness\" were recorded as well as four new Maurice Gibb compositions, but only \"Walking on Air\" and \"Man in the Middle\" were released.

The [[Princely states]] had [[List_of_princely_states_of_British_India_(by_region)#Princely States at the time of independence on 14 August 1947|their own flags]] which were to be flown alongside the [[British flag]] as a symbol of [[suzerainty]]. The official state flag for use on land was the [[Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and it was this flag that was lowered on [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] in 1947. The flag of the [[Governor-General of India]] was defaced with the [[Order of the Star of India|Star of India]]. The [[civil ensign]] and [[naval ensign]], were the [[Red Ensign]] or [[Blue Ensign]] respectively, defaced with the Star of India emblem.\n \n==History==\nIdeas for a flag for areas under British India were initially [[Empire|imperial]] ones, rather than [[nationalist]] ones. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and the later establishment of the [[British Raj]], a representative symbol of the new government was pending. Various designs were proposed for the first Star of India flag in 1863, keeping similar flag designs adopted in other [[British colonies]] such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], combining symbols of Imperial authority such as the Union Jack, the [[Tudor Crown|royal crown]], with symbols specific to the colony in question. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roy |first1=Srirupa |title=A symbol of freedom: The Indian flag and the transformations of nationalism |date=2002 |publisher=The Journal of Asian Studies |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37914933/JASRoy.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_Symbol_of_Freedom_The_Indian_Flag_and.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190704%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190704T154240Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=06228d58966a48525c9fb2f61d568529a1a7b59232f771bf1a53cf247458422e |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref>\n===Company flag===\n{{Main|Flag of the East India Company}}\n{{Gallery\n| width = 200\n| height = 150\n| align = center\n| File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg\n| Flag of the East India Company, which dissolved in 1858.\n}}\nUpon receiving Royal Assent to trade in the Indian Ocean by Queen Elizabeth I in 1600, the English East India Company adopted a flag of thirteen red and white stripes with the flag of England in canton.\n\nAfter the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the British government passed the Government of India Act 1858, nationalising the East India Company and taking over all of their possessions within India, where they would be considered legally a part of the British Raj.

It was often used to represent India, acting as an \"unofficial national flag\", in international events etc. This flag was not the Viceroy's personal flag; it was also used by Governors, Lieutenant Governors, Chief Commissioners and other British officers in India. When at sea, only the Viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast, while other officials flew it from the foremast.\n\nIts usage was discontinued from 1947, when the new Governor-General of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest (a lion standing on the Crown), beneath which was the word 'India' in gold majuscules.\n\n==Emblem==\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name = Star of India\n|image = Star-of-India-gold-centre.svg\n|middle = \n|middle_width = \n|middle_caption = \n|lesser = \n|lesser_width = \n|lesser_caption = \n|armiger = [[Empress of India|Emperor/Empress of India]]<br>[[Viceroy of India]]\n|year_adopted = 1861\n|crest = \n|torse = \n|motto = ''\"Heaven's Light Our Guide\"''\n|shield = Silver five pointed star encircled by a blue ribbon bearing the motto of [[Order of the Star of India|the order]] atop a gold [[sunburst]]. \n|supporters = \n|compartment = \n|orders = [[Order of the Star of India]]\n|other_elements = \n|earlier_versions = \n|use = Emblem of the [[Indian Empire]], alongside the [[Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom]]\n}}\n{{see also|Order of the Star of India}}The Star of India was the symbol of the [[Order of the Star of India]], a chivalric order of [[knighthood]].

In the centre of the sunburst was a light blue ribbon bearing the motto of the Order, ''{{aut|Heaven's Light Our Guide}}''. Within the ribbon was a five-pointed star, decorated with diamonds.

The [[Princely states]] had [[List_of_princely_states_of_British_India_(by_region)#Princely States at the time of independence on 14 August 1947|their own flags]] which were to be flown alongside the [[British flag]] as a symbol of [[suzerainty]]. The official state flag for use on land was the [[Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and it was this flag that was lowered on [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] in 1947. The flag of the [[Governor-General of India]] was defaced with the [[Order of the Star of India|Star of India]]. The [[civil ensign]] and [[naval ensign]], were the [[Red Ensign]] or [[Blue Ensign]] respectively, defaced with the Star of India emblem.\n \n==History==\nIdeas for a flag for areas under British India were initially [[Empire|imperial]] ones, rather than [[nationalist]] ones. After the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and the later establishment of the [[British Raj]], a representative symbol of the new government was pending. Various designs were proposed for the first Star of India flag in 1863, keeping similar flag designs adopted in other [[British colonies]] such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], combining symbols of Imperial authority such as the Union Jack, the [[Tudor Crown|royal crown]], with symbols specific to the colony in question. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roy |first1=Srirupa |title=A symbol of freedom: The Indian flag and the transformations of nationalism |date=2002 |publisher=The Journal of Asian Studies |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37914933/JASRoy.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_Symbol_of_Freedom_The_Indian_Flag_and.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190704%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190704T154240Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=06228d58966a48525c9fb2f61d568529a1a7b59232f771bf1a53cf247458422e |accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref>\n===Company flag===\n{{Main|Flag of the East India Company}}\n{{Gallery\n| width = 200\n| height = 150\n| align = center\n| File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg\n| Flag of the East India Company, which dissolved in 1858.\n}}\nUpon receiving Royal Assent to trade in the Indian Ocean by Queen Elizabeth I in 1600, the English East India Company adopted a flag of thirteen red and white stripes with the flag of England in canton.\n\nAfter the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the British government passed the Government of India Act 1858, nationalising the East India Company and taking over all of their possessions within India, where they would be considered legally a part of the British Raj.

It was often used to represent India, acting as an \"unofficial national flag\", in international events etc. This flag was not the Viceroy's personal flag; it was also used by Governors, Lieutenant Governors, Chief Commissioners and other British officers in India. When at sea, only the Viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast, while other officials flew it from the foremast.\n\nIts usage was discontinued from 1947, when the new Governor-General of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest (a lion standing on the Crown), beneath which was the word 'India' in gold majuscules.\n\n==Emblem==\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name = Star of India\n|image = Star-of-India-gold-centre.svg\n|middle = \n|middle_width = \n|middle_caption = \n|lesser = \n|lesser_width = \n|lesser_caption = \n|armiger = [[Empress of India|Emperor/Empress of India]]<br>[[Viceroy of India]]\n|year_adopted = 1861\n|crest = \n|torse = \n|motto = ''\"Heaven's Light Our Guide\"''\n|shield = Silver five pointed star encircled by a blue ribbon bearing the motto of [[Order of the Star of India|the order]] atop a gold [[sunburst]]. \n|supporters = \n|compartment = \n|orders = [[Order of the Star of India]]\n|other_elements = \n|earlier_versions = \n|use = Emblem of the [[Indian Empire]], alongside the [[Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom]]\n}}\n{{see also|Order of the Star of India}}The Star of India was the symbol of the [[Order of the Star of India]], a chivalric order of [[knighthood]].
