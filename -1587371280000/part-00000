Maurice Abrahams was so captivated by the appearance of his nephew dressed up as a cowboy that he was inspired to write \"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\".

During one of his radio shows Paul Aaron had the elder Joe Abrahams (the original Cowboy Joe) as a special guest. Paul Aaron played many versions of his favorite song dating back to one sung by Bob Roberts from an RCA Victor 78 rpm record. He also played many \"live\" versions recorded during the University of Wyoming football and basketball games. A recent version of the song appears on Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks 2009 album \"Tangled Tales\".\n\n==College fight songs==\n===University of Wyoming song===\n\"Ragtime Cowboy Joe\" is also the [[fight song]] of the [[University of Wyoming]]. Traditionally, Cowboy fans stand and clap to the beat of the song as played by Wyoming's [[Western Thunder Marching Band]]. The version of the song appropriated by Wyoming was written by Francis Edwin Stroup (1909\u20132010)<ref name=\"Leaders\" /> in 1961.  He rewrote the chorus.<ref name=\"Music Reference\" />  Stroup had been an Assistant Professor of Health and Physical Education for Men at Wyoming until August 31, 1950. He also had composed the fight song for his alma mater, the [[University of North Texas]] in 1939, ten years after graduating.<ref name=\"NTSC song\" />  The song, \"Fight, North Texas\", has endured for {{Cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1939|09|01}}}} years and the lyrics have changed minimally to reflect the name changes of the university. Stroup also composed school songs for [[Drake University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. Stroup, while teaching at [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1961, also wrote the \"Huskie Fight Song\", which was adopted as the university's fight song in 1963.<ref name=\"Herra\" /><ref name=\"Schott\" /><ref name=\"King\" /><ref name=\"NIU obit\" /><ref name=\"Studwell\" />\n\nThe lyrics Stroup wrote for the University of Wyoming follow:\n\n: (for the [[Wyoming Cowboys and Cowgirls|Cowboys]])\n\n: ''C!

The song was also a success on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|Billboard Black Singles]], peaking at No. 29. Since the song was also credited to [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|David Seville]] by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', it became Seville's fourth consecutive Top 20 single.
