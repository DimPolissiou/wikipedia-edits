Manny Diaz is a graduate of [[Florida State University]] where he joined the Gamma Rho Chapter of [[Theta Chi Fraternity]].\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===Florida State===\nDiaz began his coaching career at [[Florida State University]] in 1998, working alongside defensive coordinator [[Mickey Andrews]] for two seasons. During his stint, the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]] appeared in back-to-back [[BCS National Championship Game]]s, a loss to the [[1998 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] in the [[1999 Fiesta Bowl]] and a win against the [[1999 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech Hokies]] in the [[2000 Sugar Bowl]].\n\n===NC State===\nDiaz played a major role for one of the country's top-ranked defenses by coaching safeties in 2004 and 2005 and handling the linebackers in 2002 and 2003 for the [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State Wolfpack]].\n\nThe [[2005 NC State Wolfpack football team]] finished eighth nationally in total defense, sixth in third-down percentage, and twelfth in scoring defense en route to a 7\u20135 record and a shutout win over the [[2005 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida Bulls]] in the [[2005 Meineke Car Care Bowl]]. Diaz also served as special teams coordinator and the kickoff return unit finished fifth nationally, while the punt return team blocked four kicks.\n\nIn his first year as safeties coach and special teams coordinator in 2004, NC State's defense finished the year as the top-ranked unit in the country in total defense by allowing just over 220 yards per game. The Wolfpack defense also held national powers Ohio State and Florida State to under 130 yards of total offense during the season. Diaz's players included All-ACC performer and former [[New York Jets]] player [[Andre Maddox]]. His 2004 special teams at NC State also had three blocked punts and two returns for touchdowns.\n\nDiaz handled the linebackers for NC State in 2002 and 2003. The [[2003 NC State Wolfpack football team]] finished 7\u20135 with Diaz sharing play-calling duties for all 11 games. He also made all the defensive calls during the [[2003 Tangerine Bowl]] win over the [[2003 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas Jayhawks]].\n\nIn 2002, his first year as a full-time coach, Diaz helped the Wolfpack to one of their best seasons ever, finishing 11\u20133 and defeating [[2002 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] in the Gator Bowl.

In back-to-back games against Florida State and Notre Dame, NC State did not allow an offensive touchdown.\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\nDiaz spent four seasons as defensive coordinator at [[Middle Tennessee State University]]. Diaz also coached linebackers for two years after mentoring the safeties during his first two seasons in Murfreesboro.\n\nIn four years under Diaz, the Middle Tennessee defense led its conference in sacks and tackles for loss twice, and finished no lower than third in the league in either category during his tenure.

Diaz's defense also ranked sixth nationally in sacks that season, posting nearly three per game.\n\nAlso in 2009, Diaz tutored defensive end [[Chris McCoy]] who was tabbed the Sun Belt Conference co-Defensive Player of the Year. McCoy led the league and ranked sixth nationally in tackles for loss. Safety [[Jeremy Kellem]] and cornerbacks [[Alex Suber]] and Marcus Udell were also named first team all-SBC.

That was a dramatic turnaround for MSU from the season prior to his arrival. In 2009, the defense finished 71st in scoring defense, 62nd in rushing defense and 89th in TFL. Mississippi State also finished ranked 13th in red zone defense (.73) and 22nd in turnovers forced (28) nationally this season.\n\n===Texas===\nDiaz was introduced as the defensive coordinator for the [[Texas Longhorns]] in January 2011. During his first season at Texas, Diaz led the top defense in the Big 12 as the Longhorns ranked first in the conference in total defense, rushing defense and pass defense. Overall the unit ranked 11th nationally in total defense and was sixth against the run despite facing six offenses that ranked in the top 15 nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://texassports.com/coaches.aspx?rc=488=|title=|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the Longhorns' defense, under Diaz, gave up a school record 550 yards rushing to [[2013 BYU Cougars football team|Brigham Young University]], including 257 to quarterback [[Taysom Hill]].

The Jeweler.\" Citing a need for his defense to create more turnovers, the chain became a frenzy as Miami opened the 2017 season 10-0 and won the ACC Coastal Division for the first time. Miami appeared in the 2017 Capital One Orange Bowl. Continuing the impressive trends from Diaz\u2019s first year running the defense, the Hurricanes ranked among the nation\u2019s leaders in several defensive categories in 2017, including first nationally in team sacks, third nationally in tackles for loss and ninth nationally in opponent yards per play.\n\nIn his final season as defensive coordinator in 2018, the Hurricanes ranked No. 4 in NCAA in total defense and ranked No. 1 in several categories, including tackles for loss, third down conversion percentage and passing yards allowed.

In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]] to [[Petronas]] Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the [[Sirte Basin]], [[Libya]]. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100&nbsp;km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[oil equivalent]].

A status that continues today. The largest discoveries have been made in the Utsira High ([[Johan Sverdrup oil field]], [[Edvard Grieg oil field]]) and in the southern Barents Sea (the Alta, Gohta and Filicudi discoveries). By the end of 2016, Lundin Energy had drilled a total of 84 exploration and appraisal wells in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2016_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2016 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum AB |accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Lundin family has been involved in oil exploration and production for over thirty years.

In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]] to [[Petronas]] Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the [[Sirte Basin]], [[Libya]]. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100&nbsp;km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[oil equivalent]]. In [[Tunisia]], the Oudna field development (Lundin Petroleum 40% working interest) was successfully completed and production commenced in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2006_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2006 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Lundin Petroleum acquired Coparex International from BNP Paribas, adding exploration and production assets in France, Netherlands, Tunisia, Venezuela, Indonesia and Albania to the existing portfolio. The acquisition transformed Lundin Petroleum from a pure exploration company into a larger E&P player. In early 2003, Lundin Petroleum entered Norway for the first time by acquiring 75 percent of the shareholding in Norwegian OER oil.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 2004, Lundin Petroleum acquired a portfolio of producing assets in the UK from DNO AS, doubling Lundin Petroleum's reserves to {{convert|138|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=unit|order=flip}} of oil equivalent and increased production to {{convert|28,900|oilbbl|m3|order=flip}} per day of oil equivalent.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn April 2010 it [[demerger|demerged]] its assets on the [[United Kingdom Continental Shelf]] into [[Petrofac]]'s Energy Developments unit to form the stand-alone company [[EnQuest]].\n\nIn 2010, Lundin Petroleum made a large discovery on the Avaldsnes prospect in PL501 on the Utsira High in the North Sea, estimated to contain recoverable resources of {{convert|100|to|400|e6oilbbl|e6m3|order=flip|abbr=unit}} of oil equivalent.

The reported crimes include indiscriminate attacks and intentional targeting of civilians, burning of shelters, pillage, destruction of objects necessary for survival, unlawful killing of civilians, rape of women, abduction of children, torture, and forced displacement. Approximately 12.000 people died and 160.000 were violently displaced from their land and homes, many forever.

The trial is likely to begin by the end of 2020 and may take several years.\n\nThe Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities. In May 2016, representatives of communities in Block 5A claimed their right to remedy and reparation and called upon Lundin and its shareholders to pay off their debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://https://unpaiddebt.org/remedy-claim/ |publisher=Unpaid Debt |title=Victim's Remedy Claim |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> A conviction in Sweden may provide remedy and reparation for a few victims of human rights violations who will be witnesses in court, but not for the app. 200,000 victims who will not be represented in court. \n\nLundin Energy endorses the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, acknowledging the duty of business enterprises to contribute to effective remedy of adverse impact that it has caused or contributed to.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lundin-petroleum.com/.../cr_humanrights_policy_e.pdf |title=Lundin Petroleum Humanrights Policy |accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> The company has never refuted publicly reported incriminating facts.

It would be the first time since the Nuremberg trails that a multibillion-dollar company were to be charged for international crimes. The court is likely to answer a number of important legal questions, including about the individual criminal liability of corporate executives vs. corporate criminal liability of organisations, the applicable standard of proof for international crimes before a national court, and the question whether a lack of due diligence is sufficient for a finding of guilt.

Several witnesses have been granted asylum in safe countries through UNHCR supported emergency protection procedures. The company has confirmed that its CEO and Chairman have been officially informed by the prosecutor about the allegation, noting that it believes that it is completely unfounded.
