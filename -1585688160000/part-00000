If the leaflets do not close correctly, [[Aortic insufficiency|aortic regurgitation]] can occur. If these become severe enough, they may require heart surgery. The heart is put under more stress in order to either pump more blood through a stenotic valve or attempt to circulate regurgitation blood through a leaking valve.{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Aortic lesions====\nOne of the most notable associations with BAV is the tendency for these patients to present with ascending aortic aneurysmal lesions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\nThe extracellular matrix of the aorta in patients with BAV shows marked deviations from that of the normal tricuspid aortic valve.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\nIt is currently believed that an increase in the ratio of [[MMP2]] (Matrix Metalloproteinases 2) to [[TIMP1]] ([[tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase]]) may be responsible for the abnormal degradation of the valve matrix and therefore lead to aortic dissection and aneurysm. However, other studies have also shown MMP9 involvement with no differences in TIMP expression. The size of the proximal aorta should be evaluated carefully during the workup. The initial diameter of the aorta should be noted and annual evaluation with [[CT scan]], or [[MRI]] to avoid [[ionizing radiation]], should be recommended to the patient; the examination should be conducted more frequently if a change in aortic diameter is seen. From this monitoring, the type of surgery that should be offered to the patient can be determined based on the change in size of the aorta.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n====Aortic narrowing====\nA bicuspid aortic valve may cause the heart's aortic valve to narrow ([[aortic stenosis]]). This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart to the body. In some cases, the aortic valve does not close tightly, causing [[Aortic regurgitation|blood to leak backward]] into the left ventricle.<ref>Aortic valve stenosis (AVS).

bicuspid aortic valve.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /><ref name=\"bic11\" /> The patient-specific risk of developing complications such as aortic aneurysms is dependent on the particular aortic leaflet fusion pattern, with each pattern varying in 4D MRI measurements of wall [[shear stress]] (WSS), blood flow velocity, asymmetrical flow displacement and flow angle of the aorta.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /><ref name=\"bic13\" />\n\nBAV outflow is helical and occurs at high velocities (>1&nbsp;m/s) throughout the ascending aorta.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /><ref name=\"bic11\" /> This is potentially more damaging to the aorta in comparison to the streamline flow and short-lived burst of high velocity at the beginning of the aorta, as seen within a healthy tricuspid valve.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> This eccentric outflow from the BAV results in blood hitting and reflecting off the aortic wall in a non-streamline fashion.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" />  The specific zones where blood hits is dependent on the varying BAV leaflet fusion patterns and consequently correlates with increases in WSS.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic13\" /> WSS measurements in RL fusion indicate an increase in pressure applied predominantly to the right-anterior side of the vessel wall, while RN fusion increases WSS on the right-posterior wall.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic13\" /> The resulting rise in WSS is supported by the asymmetrical displacement of blood flow produced by an increased angle of outflow from the BAV.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /> Displacement is measured as the distance in millimeters from the center of the aorta to the center of the high velocity outflow.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Blood does not flow centrally through the aorta in BAV, but along the right-anterior and right-posterior vessel wall for RL and RN leaflet fusion respectively.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" />\n\n===Aortic disease===\nIdentification of hemodynamics for RL, RN, and left coronary and noncoronary leaflet fusion patterns enables detection of specific aortic regions susceptible to dysfunction and the eventual development of disease.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /> Specifically, RL and RN fusion patterns are more likely to develop into these aortic disease states.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /> The blood flow information associated with RL fusion causes dilation of the mid-ascending aorta, while RN fusion is associated with dilation in the root, distal ascending aorta and transverse arch.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic11\" /> BAV helical and high velocity outflow patterns are consistent with aortic dilation hemodynamics seen in those with tricuspid aortic valves.<ref name=\"bic10\" /> However, it is the increase and variance in WSS and flow displacement in BAV that demonstrate the importance of aortic leaflet morphology.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Flow displacement measurements taken from 4D MRI may be best for detecting irregularities in hemodynamics.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Displacement measurements were highly sensitive and distinguishable between different valve morphologies.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Hemodynamic measurements from 4D MRI in patients with BAV are advantageous in determining the timing and location of repair surgery to the aorta in aortopathy states.<ref name=\"bic7\" />\n\nMost patients with bicuspid aortic valve whose valve becomes dysfunctional will need careful follow-up and potentially valve replacement at some point in

Heart valves play a crucial role in ensuring the unidirectional flow of blood from the atrium to the ventricles, or from the ventricle to the [[aorta]] or [[pulmonary trunk]].\n<!-- Cause and Pathophysiology -->\n<!-- Prevention and Treatment -->\n<!-- Epidemiology -->\n\n===Signs and symptoms===\nIn many cases, a bicuspid aortic valve will cause no problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/CardiovascularConditionsofChildhood/Commonly-Asked-Questions-About-Children-and-Heart-Disease_UCM_311917_Article.jsp |title=Atrial Septal Defect |work=Commonly Asked Questions About Children and Heart Disease |date=October 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref> People with BAV may become tired more easily than those with normal valvular function and have difficulty maintaining stamina for cardio-intensive activities due to poor heart performance.\n\n===Complications===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}\n\n====Calcification====\nBAV may become calcified later in life, which may lead to varying degrees of severity of [[aortic stenosis]] that will manifest as [[heart murmur|murmur]]s. If the leaflets do not close correctly, [[Aortic insufficiency|aortic regurgitation]] can occur. If these become severe enough, they may require heart surgery. The heart is put under more stress in order to either pump more blood through a stenotic valve or attempt to circulate regurgitation blood through a leaking valve.{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Aortic lesions====\nOne of the most notable associations with BAV is the tendency for these patients to present with ascending aortic aneurysmal lesions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\nThe extracellular matrix of the aorta in patients with BAV shows marked deviations from that of the normal tricuspid aortic valve.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\nIt is currently believed that an increase in the ratio of [[MMP2]] (Matrix Metalloproteinases 2) to [[TIMP1]] ([[tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase]]) may be responsible for the abnormal degradation of the valve matrix and therefore lead to aortic dissection and aneurysm. However, other studies have also shown MMP9 involvement with no differences in TIMP expression. The size of the proximal aorta should be evaluated carefully during the workup. The initial diameter of the aorta should be noted and annual evaluation with [[CT scan]], or [[MRI]] to avoid [[ionizing radiation]], should be recommended to the patient; the examination should be conducted more frequently if a change in aortic diameter is seen. From this monitoring, the type of surgery that should be offered to the patient can be determined based on the change in size of the aorta.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n====Aortic narrowing====\nA bicuspid aortic valve may cause the heart's aortic valve to narrow ([[aortic stenosis]]). This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart to the body. In some cases, the aortic valve does not close tightly, causing [[Aortic regurgitation|blood to leak backward]] into the left ventricle.<ref>Aortic valve stenosis (AVS).

bicuspid aortic valve.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /><ref name=\"bic11\" /> The patient-specific risk of developing complications such as aortic aneurysms is dependent on the particular aortic leaflet fusion pattern, with each pattern varying in 4D MRI measurements of wall [[shear stress]] (WSS), blood flow velocity, asymmetrical flow displacement and flow angle of the aorta.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /><ref name=\"bic13\" />\n\nBAV outflow is helical and occurs at high velocities (>1&nbsp;m/s) throughout the ascending aorta.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /><ref name=\"bic11\" /> This is potentially more damaging to the aorta in comparison to the streamline flow and short-lived burst of high velocity at the beginning of the aorta, as seen within a healthy tricuspid valve.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> This eccentric outflow from the BAV results in blood hitting and reflecting off the aortic wall in a non-streamline fashion.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" />  The specific zones where blood hits is dependent on the varying BAV leaflet fusion patterns and consequently correlates with increases in WSS.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic13\" /> WSS measurements in RL fusion indicate an increase in pressure applied predominantly to the right-anterior side of the vessel wall, while RN fusion increases WSS on the right-posterior wall.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic13\" /> The resulting rise in WSS is supported by the asymmetrical displacement of blood flow produced by an increased angle of outflow from the BAV.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /> Displacement is measured as the distance in millimeters from the center of the aorta to the center of the high velocity outflow.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Blood does not flow centrally through the aorta in BAV, but along the right-anterior and right-posterior vessel wall for RL and RN leaflet fusion respectively.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" />\n\n===Aortic disease===\nIdentification of hemodynamics for RL, RN, and left coronary and noncoronary leaflet fusion patterns enables detection of specific aortic regions susceptible to dysfunction and the eventual development of disease.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /> Specifically, RL and RN fusion patterns are more likely to develop into these aortic disease states.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic9\" /> The blood flow information associated with RL fusion causes dilation of the mid-ascending aorta, while RN fusion is associated with dilation in the root, distal ascending aorta and transverse arch.<ref name=\"bic7\" /><ref name=\"bic11\" /> BAV helical and high velocity outflow patterns are consistent with aortic dilation hemodynamics seen in those with tricuspid aortic valves.<ref name=\"bic10\" /> However, it is the increase and variance in WSS and flow displacement in BAV that demonstrate the importance of aortic leaflet morphology.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Flow displacement measurements taken from 4D MRI may be best for detecting irregularities in hemodynamics.<ref name=\"bic7\" /> Displacement measurements were highly sensitive and distinguishable between

Kotick instituted a large restructuring to pull the company out of debt, including renaming the company as Activision and moving it to Santa Monica, California. After bringing the company back to profitability by 1997, Kotick spent the next decade expanding Activision's products through acquisitions of an estimated 25 studios, which resulted in several successful series of games, including ''[[Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk's]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. However, by around 2006, the popularity of [[massively multiplayer online]] (MMO) games started to grow. Such games provide a constant revenue stream to their publishers, rather than only a single purchase, making them a more valuable proposition. None of Activision's subsidiaries had an MMO or the capability to make one quickly. Furthering this, Activision was facing tougher competition from companies like [[Electronic Arts]], as well as slowdowns in sales of their key game series.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\">{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html#788254c31a16 | title = Activision's Unlikely Hero | first = Peter | last = Beller | date = January 15, 2009 | accessdate = February 12, 2019 | work = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]}}</ref>\n\nAround 2006, Kotick reached out to [[Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy]], the CEO of the French media conglomerate [[Vivendi]]. Vivendi at that time had a small games division, [[Vivendi Games]], a holding company principally for [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. Kotick wanted to get access to Blizzard's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', a successful MMO, and suggested a means to acquire this to L\u00e9vy. L\u00e9vy instead offered that he would be willing to merge Vivendi Games with Activision, but only if Vivendi kept majority control of the merged company. According to those close to Kotick, Kotick was concerned about this offer as it would force him to cede control of Activision. However, after talking to Blizzard's CEO [[Mike Morhaime]], Kotick recognized that Vivendi would be able to give them inroads into the growing video game market in China.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nKotick proposed the merger to Activision's board, which agreed to it in December 2007. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in [[California]].

Kotick instituted a large restructuring to pull the company out of debt, including renaming the company as Activision and moving it to Santa Monica, California. After bringing the company back to profitability by 1997, Kotick spent the next decade expanding Activision's products through acquisitions of an estimated 25 studios, which resulted in several successful series of games, including ''[[Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk's]]'', ''[[Call of Duty]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. However, by around 2006, the popularity of [[massively multiplayer online]] (MMO) games started to grow. Such games provide a constant revenue stream to their publishers, rather than only a single purchase, making them a more valuable proposition. None of Activision's subsidiaries had an MMO or the capability to make one quickly. Furthering this, Activision was facing tougher competition from companies like [[Electronic Arts]], as well as slowdowns in sales of their key game series.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\">{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html#788254c31a16 | title = Activision's Unlikely Hero | first = Peter | last = Beller | date = January 15, 2009 | accessdate = February 12, 2019 | work = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]}}</ref>\n\nAround 2006, Kotick reached out to [[Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy]], the CEO of the French media conglomerate [[Vivendi]]. Vivendi at that time had a small games division, [[Vivendi Games]], a holding company principally for [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. Kotick wanted to get access to Blizzard's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', a successful MMO, and suggested a means to acquire this to L\u00e9vy. L\u00e9vy instead offered that he would be willing to merge Vivendi Games with Activision, but only if Vivendi kept majority control of the merged company. According to those close to Kotick, Kotick was concerned about this offer as it would force him to cede control of Activision. However, after talking to Blizzard's CEO [[Mike Morhaime]], Kotick recognized that Vivendi would be able to give them inroads into the growing video game market in China.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nKotick proposed the merger to Activision's board, which agreed to it in December 2007. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in [[California]].

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an [[artist]] and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

The reflexive space, the powerful creations are not synonymous with anarchy. It is about safeguarding the autonomy of artistic creation and affirming a critical attitude towards the present world. Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an [[artist]] and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.
