However, a return of darker plot elements and storylines more related to relevant social issues, such as racism, began to flourish during the period, prefiguring the later [[Modern Age of Comic Books]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:9.13.09DennyO'NeillByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ground-breaking writer [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] discussed topics previously avoided in comics, such as drug abuse and urban poverty.]]\n\nThere is no one single event that can be said to herald the beginning of the Bronze Age. Instead, a number of events at the beginning of the 1970s, taken together, can be seen as a shift away from the tone of comics in the previous decade.\n\nOne such event was the April 1970 issue of [[Green Lantern]], which added [[Green Arrow]] as a title character.  The series, written by [[Denny O'Neil]] and penciled by [[Neal Adams]] (inking was by Adams or [[Dick Giordano]]), focused on \"relevance\" as Green Lantern was exposed to poverty and experienced self-doubt.<ref>Jacobs, Will, Gerard Jones (1985).

Retrieved 2011-10-23.</ref>\n\nLater in 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] left [[Marvel Comics]], ending arguably the most important creative partnership of the Silver Age (with [[Stan Lee]]). Kirby then turned to [[DC Comics|DC]], where he created ''[[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]'' series of titles starting with ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]] #133'' in December 1970. Also in 1970 [[Mort Weisinger]], the long term editor of the various [[Superman]] titles, retired to be replaced by [[Julius Schwartz]]. Schwartz set about toning down some of the more fanciful aspects of the Weisinger era, removing most [[Kryptonite]] from continuity and scaling back Superman's nigh-infinite\u2014by then\u2014powers, which was done by veteran Superman artist [[Curt Swan]] together with groundbreaking author [[Denny O'Neil]].\n\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age coincided with the end of the careers of many of the veteran writers and artists of the time, or their promotion to management positions and retirement from regular writing or drawing, and their replacement with a younger generation of editors and creators, many of whom knew each other from their experiences in comic book fan conventions and publications. At the same time, publishers began the era by scaling back on their super-hero publications, canceling many of the weaker-selling titles, and experimenting with other genres such as horror and sword-and-sorcery.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe era also encompassed major changes in the distribution of and audience for comic books. Over time, the medium shifted from cheap mass market products sold at [[newsstand]]s to a more expensive product sold at specialty comic book shops and aimed at a smaller, core audience of fans. The shift in distribution allowed many small-print publishers to enter the market, changing the medium from one dominated by a few large publishers to a more diverse and eclectic range of books.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==The 1970s==\n[[File:Green lantern 85.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' #85 (October 1971), one of the first comic stories to tackle the issue of drug use, cover art by [[Neal Adams]].]]\nIn 1970, Marvel published the first comic book issue of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s pulp character [[Conan the Barbarian]]. Conan's [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|success as a comic hero]] resulted in adaptations of other Howard characters: [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]], [[Red Sonja]], and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]].  DC Comics responded with comics featuring [[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]], [[Beowulf (DC Comics)|Beowulf]], and [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser#Comics adaptations|Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]]. They also took over the licensing of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Tarzan (comics)#DC Comics|Tarzan]] from long-time publisher [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]] and began adapting other Burroughs creations, such as [[John Carter, Warlord of Mars|John Carter]], the [[Pellucidar|Pellucidar series]], and the [[Amtor#Comic books|Amtor series]].  Marvel also adapted to comic book form, with less success, [[Edwin Lester Arnold]]'s character [[Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation#In other media|Gullivar Jones]] and, later, [[Lin Carter]]'s [[Thongor of Lemuria#Marvel Comics adaptation|Thongor]].\n\nThe murder of [[Spider-Man]]'s longtime girlfriend, [[Gwen Stacy]], at the hands of the [[Green Goblin]] in 1973's ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #121-122 is considered by comics scholar Arnold T. Blumberg to be the definitive Bronze Age event, as it exemplifies the period's trend towards darker territory and willingness to subvert conventions such as the assumed survival of long-established, \"untouchable\" characters. However, there had been a gradual darkening of the tone of superhero comics for several years prior to \"[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]\", including the death of [[George Stacy|her father]] in 1970's ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90 and the beginning of the [[Dennis O'Neil]]/[[Neal Adams]] tenure on ''Batman''.\n\nIn 1971, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Stan Lee was approached by the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story, \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]],\" which portrayed drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. At that time, any portrayal of drug use in comic books was banned outright by the [[Comics Code Authority]], regardless of the context. The CCA refused to approve the story, but Lee published it regardless.\n\nThe positive reception that the story received led to the CCA revising the Comics Code later that year to allow the portrayal of drug addiction as long as it was depicted in a negative light. Soon after, DC Comics had their own drug abuse storyline in ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Green Arrow]]'' #85-86. Written by [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] with art by [[Neal Adams]], the storyline was entitled \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]],\" and it revealed that the Green Arrow's sidekick [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] had become addicted to [[heroin]].\n\nThe 1971 revision to the Comics Code has also been seen as relaxing the rules on the use of vampires, ghouls and werewolves in comic books, allowing the growth of a number of supernatural and horror-oriented titles, such as ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', among numerous others. However, the tone of horror comic stories had already seen substantial changes between the relatively tame offerings of the early 1960s (e.g. ''Unusual Tales'') and the more violent products available in the late 1960s (e.g. ''The Witching Hour'', revised formats in ''House of Secrets'', ''House of Mystery'', ''The Unexpected'').\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, publishers moved away from the super-hero stories that enjoyed mass-market popularity in the mid-1960s; DC cancelled most of its super-hero titles other than those starring Superman and Batman, while Marvel cancelled weaker-selling titles such as ''Dr. Strange'', ''Sub-Mariner'' and ''The X-Men''. In their place, they experimented with a wide variety of other genres, including Westerns, horror and monster stories, and the above-mentioned adaptations of pulp adventures. These trends peaked in the early 1970s, and the medium reverted by the mid-1970s to selling predominantly super-hero titles.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Further developments==\n\n===Social relevance===\nA concern with social issues had been a part of comic book stories since their beginnings: early Superman stories, for example, dealt with issues such as child mistreatment and working conditions for [[Minor (law)|minors]]. However, in the 1970s relevance became not only a feature of the stories, but also something that the books loudly proclaimed on their covers to promote sales. The Spider-Man drug issues were at the forefront of the trend of \"social relevance\" with comic books noticeably handling real-life issues. The above-mentioned ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' series dealt not only with drugs, but other topics like racism and environmental degradation. The X-Men titles, which were partly based on the premise that mutants were a metaphor for real-world minorities, became wildly popular. Other well-known \"relevant\" comics include the  \"[[Demon in a Bottle]]\", where [[Iron Man]] confronts his alcoholism, and the socially conscious stories written by [[Steve Gerber]] in such titles as ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' and ''[[Omega the Unknown]]''. Issues regarding female empowerment became trends with female versions of popular male characters ([[Spider-Woman]], [[Red Sonja]], [[Ms. Marvel]], [[She-Hulk]]).\n\n===Creator credit and labor agreements===\nWriters and artists began getting a lot more credit for their creations even though they were still ceding copyrights to the companies for whom they worked. Pencil Artists were allowed to keep their original artwork and sell it on the open market.  When word got out that Superman's creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] were living in poverty, artists such as Neal Adams, [[Jerry Robinson]], and [[Bernie Wrightson]] helped organize fellow artists to pressure DC in rectifying them and other pioneers from the 1930s and 1940s. Newer publishers, such as Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, negotiated contracts in which creators retained copyright to their creations.\n\n===Minority superheroes===\nOne of the most significant developments during the period was a substantial rise in the number of black and other non-white minority superheroes. Before the 1970s, there had been very few non-white superheroes ([[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] being notable exceptions) but starting in the early 1970s this began to change with the introduction of characters such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Luke Cage]] (who was the first black superhero to star in his own comic book in 1972) of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],  [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Monica Rambeau]] of the Avengers, [[Misty Knight]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[DC (comics)|DC]]'s Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], [[Bronze Tiger]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] of [[Teen Titans]] many of whom were black (with the exception of Shang-Chi himself). Additionally, Jewish superheroes became more visible with the appearances of Marvel's [[Kitty Pryde]] of the X-Men and [[Moon Knight]] respectively.\n\nCharacters such as Luke Cage, [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], Misty Knight, Shang-Chi, and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] have been seen by some as an attempt by Marvel Comics to cash in on the 1970s crazes for [[Kung Fu]] movies. However, these and other minority characters came into their own after these film trends faded, and became increasingly popular and important as time progressed. By the mid-1980s, Storm and Cyborg had become leaders of the [[X-Men]] and [[Teen Titans]] respectively, and John Stewart briefly replaced [[Hal Jordan]] as the lead character of the ''[[Green Lantern]]'' title.\n\n===Art styles===\nStarting with Neal Adams' work in ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' a newly sophisticated realism became the norm in the industry. Buyers would no longer be interested in the heavily stylized work of artists of the Silver Age or simpler cartooning of the Golden Age. The so-called \"House Styles\" of DC and Marvel became imitations of Adams' work and much more realistic versions of Kirby's respectively. This change is sometimes credited to a new generation of artists influenced by the popularity of [[EC Comics]] in the 1950s. In spite of the House Styles, those artists who could draw apart from these would gain some notoriety. Such names include [[Berni Wrightson]], [[Jim Aparo]], [[Jim Starlin]], [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[George P\u00e9rez]], and [[Howard Chaykin]].  A secondary line of comics at DC, headed by former EC Comics artist Joe Orlando and devoted to horror titles, established a differing set of styles and aggressively sought talent from Asia and Latin America.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===The revival of the X-Men and the Teen Titans===\nThe [[X-Men]] were originally created in 1963 by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. However, the title never achieved the popularity of other Lee/Kirby creations, and by 1970 Marvel ceased publishing new material and the title was turned over to reprints. But in 1975 an \"all-new all-different\" version of the X-Men was introduced by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Cockrum]] in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, with Chris Claremont as uncredited assistant co-plotter.<ref>Chris Claremont's role in this issue is mentioned in ''Official Marvel Index to the X-Men'' #4, November 1987</ref> Claremont stayed as writer on just about all X-Men related titles, including spinoffs, for the next sixteen years, after which other regular writers such as Louise Simonson, Fabian Nicieza, and Scott Lobdell joined and Claremont eventually left.\n\nOne of the most apparent influences from this series was the creation of what became DC Comics' answer to X-Men's character-based storytelling style, ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]], which became a highly successful and influential property in its own right. Wolfman would associate himself with the title for sixteen years, while Perez established a large fan base and sought-after pencilling style. A [[Teen Titans (TV series)|successful cartoon]] based on the Titans of the Bronze Age of Comics was launched in 2003, and lasted for four years.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Team-up books and anthologies===\nDuring the Silver Age, comic books frequently had several features, a form harkening back to the Golden Age when the first comics were anthologies. In 1968, Marvel graduated its double feature characters appearing in their anthologies to full-length stories in their own comic. But several of these characters could not sustain their own title and were cancelled. Marvel tried to create new double feature anthologies such as ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' and ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' which did not last as double feature comic books. A more enduring concept was that of the team-up book, either combining two characters, at least one of which was not popular enough to sustain its own title (''Green Lantern/Green Arrow''). Even DC combined two features in ''[[Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' and had team-up books (''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]''). Virtually all such books disappeared by the end of the period.\n\n===Company crossovers===\nMarvel and DC worked out several crossover titles the first of which was ''[[Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. This was followed by a second Superman and Spider-Man, ''Batman vs. the Incredible Hulk'' and the ''[[The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans|X-Men vs The New Teen Titans]]''. Another title, ''The Avengers vs. the Justice League of America'' was written by [[Gerry Conway]] and drawn by [[George P\u00e9rez]] with plotting by Roy Thomas, but was never published, reflecting the later animosity between the two companies. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was not pleased that DC wanted the fourth company crossover to include the New Teen Titans, DC's best-selling title at the time, as he wanted the crossover to be the X-Men and the Legion of Super-Heroes. This led to Shooter's decision to stall and cancel the JLA/Avengers project.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Reprints===\nBeginning circa 1970, Marvel introduced vast numbers of reprints into the market, which played a key role in their becoming the overall market leader among comic publishers. Suddenly many titles featured reprints:  ''X-Men'', ''Sgt. Fury'', ''[[Kid Colt Outlaw]]'', ''Rawhide Kid'', ''Two-Gun Kid'', ''Outlaw Kid'', ''Jungle Action'', ''Special Marvel Edition'' (the early issues), ''War is Hell'' (the early issues), ''Creatures on the Loose'', ''Monsters on the Prowl'', and ''FEAR'', to name just a few.\n\n===DC Implosion===\nIn the mid-'70s, DC launched numerous new titles such as [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[New Gods]]'' and [[Steve Ditko]]'s ''[[Shade the Changing Man]]''. [[Jenette Kahn]] would eventually take the helm of the company in 1976. The company followed this up in 1978 with the \"[[DC Explosion]]\" where the standard line of books increased in page count and 50 cent price. Many of these titles added backup features with various characters. However, DC greatly overestimated the appeal of so many new titles at once, sales dropped severely during the harsh 1978 winter and it nearly broke the company and the industry, including [[Charlton Comics]]; this event has been called the \"[[DC Implosion]]\".\n\nMarvel eventually gained 50% of the market and Stan Lee handed control of the comic division to [[Jim Shooter]] while he worked with their growing animation spin-offs.\n\n===Non-superhero comics===\nAs the Bronze Age began in the early 1970s, popularity shifted away from the established superhero genre towards comic book titles from which superheroes were absent altogether. These non-superhero comics were typically inspired by genres like Westerns or fantasy & pulp fiction.  As previously noted, 1971's revised Comics Code left the horror genre ripe for development and several supernaturally-themed series resulted, such as the popular ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[Swamp Thing]]''.  In the science fiction genre, [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] survival stories were an early trend, as evidenced by characters like ''[[Deathlok]]'', ''[[Killraven]]'', and ''[[Kamandi]]''. The long-running sci-fi/fantasy anthology comic magazine ''[[Metal Hurlant]]'' and its American counterpart ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' began pub\u2264\u00f7lishing in the late '70s.  Marvel's ''[[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Star Wars]]'' series was very popular with a nine-year run.\n\nOther titles began from characters originally found in 20th century pulp magazines or novels.  Noteworthy examples are the long running titles ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' (the latter was published as a magazine, bypassing the Comics Code),  as well as ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung-Fu]]''.  The early success of these titles soon led to more pulp character adaptations  (''[[Doc Savage]]'', ''[[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]]'', ''[[The Shadow]]'', ''[[Justice, Inc.]]'', ''[[Tarzan]]'').  During this period, both Marvel and DC also regularly published official comic book adaptations for various projects, including popular movies (''[[Planet of the Apes (comics)#Marvel Comics|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Godzilla Squad|Godzilla]]'', ''[[Logan's Run]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones comic books|Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[Jaws 2]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Star Wars comics|Star Wars]]''), TV shows (''The [[Man from Atlantis]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (comics)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[List of Star Trek comic books|Star Trek]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Welcome Back Kotter]]''), toys (''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel Comics)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]]'', ''[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'', ''[[Rom the Spaceknight|Rom]]'', ''[[Atari Force]]'', ''[[Thundercats]]''), and even public figures ([[Kiss (comics)|Kiss]], [[John Tartaglione|Pope John Paul II]]).\n\nThough not necessarily \"non-superhero\", a few unconventional comic book series from the period featured one or more villains as their central character (''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', ''[[Secret Society of Super-Villains]]'', ''The [[Joker (comic book)|Joker]]'').\n\n==Alternate markets and formats==\n[[Archie Comics]] dominated the female market during this time with their characters, [[Betty and Veronica]] having some of the largest circulation of titular female characters. Several clones were attempted by Marvel and DC unsuccessfully. Several Archie titles examined socially relevant issues and introduced a few African-American characters.  Archie largely switched to [[paperback]] [[digest size|digest format]] in the late 1980s.\n\nChildren's comics were still popular with Disney reprints under the [[Gold Key]] label along with [[Harvey Comics|Harvey]]'s stable of characters which grew in popularity. The latter included ''[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]'', ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]'', and ''[[Wendy the Good Little Witch|Wendy]]'', which eventually switched to digest format as well. Again Marvel and DC were unable to emulate their success with competing titles.\n\nAn 'explicit content' market akin to the niche [[Underground Comix]] of the late '60s was ostensibly opened with the Franco-Belgian import ''[[Heavy Metal Magazine]]''. Marvel launched competing magazine titles of their own with ''Conan the Barbarian'' and ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' which would eventually become its division of Direct Sales comics.\n\nThe paper drives of [[World War II]] and a growing nostalgia among [[Baby Boom|Baby-Boomers]] in the 1970s made comic books of the 1930s and 1940s extremely valuable. DC experimented with some large size paperback books to reprint their Golden Age comics, create one-shot stories such as ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition|Superman vs. Shazam]]'' and ''[[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali]]'' as well as the early Marvel crossovers.\n\nThe popularity of those early books also opened up a market for specialty shops. The existence of these shops made it possible for small-press publishers to reach an audience, and some comic book artists began self-publishing their own work. Notable titles of this type included [[Dave Sim]]'s ''[[Cerebus]]'' and [[Wendy and Richard Pini]]'s ''[[Elfquest]]'' series. Other small-press publishers came in to take advantage of this growing market: [[Pacific Comics]] introduced in 1981 a line of books by comic-book veterans such as Jack Kirby, Mike Grell and [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]], for which the artists retained copyright and shared in royalties.\n\nIn 1978, [[Will Eisner]] published his \"[[graphic novel]]\" ''[[A Contract With God]]'', an attempt to produce a long-format story outside the traditional comic book genres. In the early 1980s [[Art Spiegelman]] and [[Fran\u00e7oise Mouly]] began publishing ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw Magazine]]'', which included the early serialization of Spiegelman's award-winning graphic novel ''[[Maus]]''.\n\nComics sold on newsstands were distributed on the basis that unsold copies were returned to the publisher. Comics sold to comic shops were sold on a no-return basis. This allowed small-press titles sold through the direct market to keep publishing costs down and increase profits, making viable titles that otherwise would have been unprofitable. Marvel and DC began taking advantage of this direct market themselves, publishing books and titles distributed only through comic book shops.\n\n===Disappearing genres===\n\nThis period is also marked by the cancellation of most titles in the genres of romance, western and war stories that had been a mainstay of comics production since the forties. Most anthologies, whether they presented feature characters or not, also disappeared. They had been used since the Golden Age to create new characters, to host characters that lost their own title or to feature several characters. This had the effect of standardizing the length of comics stories within a narrow range so that multiple stand-alone stories would appear within a single issue.  The [[underground comix]] of the 1960s counterculture continued, but contracted significantly and were ultimately subsumed into the emerging [[direct market]].\n\n==End of the Bronze Age==\nOne commonly used ending point for the Bronze Age is the 1985\u20131986 time frame. As with the Silver Age, the end of the Bronze Age relates to a number of trends and events that happened at around the same time. At this point, DC Comics completed its special event, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' which marked the revitalization of the company's product line to become a serious market contender against Marvel, as happened before. This time frame also includes the company's release of the highly acclaimed works, ''[[Watchmen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], which redefined the superhero genre and inspired years of \"grim and gritty\" comic books.\n\nAt Marvel Comics, the commonly used milestone marking the end of the Bronze Age is ''[[Secret Wars]]'', although this could be extended to 1986 which saw the cancellation of ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'', as well as the launch of the [[New Universe]] and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (extension of the X-Men franchise).\n\nAfter the Bronze Age came the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], alternatively referred to as the Dark Age of Comic Books. According to Shawn O'Rourke of [[PopMatters]], the shift from the previous ages involved a \"deconstructive and dystopian re-envisioning of iconic characters and the worlds that they live in\",<ref name=\"O'Rourke\"/> as typified by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986) and [[Alan Moore]]'s and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' (1986\u20131987). Other features that define the era are an increase in adult oriented content, the rise of the [[X-Men]] as Marvel Comics' \"dominant intellectual property\", and a reorganization of the industry's distribution system.<ref name=\"O'Rourke\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/50380/a-new-era-infinite-crisis-civil-war-and-the-end-of-the-modern-age-of-comics/ |title=A New Era: Infinite Crisis, Civil War, and the End of the Modern Age of Comics |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=O'Rourke |first=Shawn |date=22 February 2008 |publisher=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref>\nThese changes would also lead to the appearance of new independent comic book publishers in the early 1990s - such as [[Image Comics]], with titles like ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' and ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' which also boasted a darker, sarcastic and more mature approach to superhero storylines.\n\n==Noted Bronze Age talents==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Writers'''\n* [[T.

However, a return of darker plot elements and storylines more related to relevant social issues, such as racism, began to flourish during the period, prefiguring the later [[Modern Age of Comic Books]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:9.13.09DennyO'NeillByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ground-breaking writer [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] discussed topics previously avoided in comics, such as drug abuse and urban poverty.]]\n\nThere is no one single event that can be said to herald the beginning of the Bronze Age. Instead, a number of events at the beginning of the 1970s, taken together, can be seen as a shift away from the tone of comics in the previous decade.\n\nOne such event was the April 1970 issue of [[Green Lantern]], which added [[Green Arrow]] as a title character.  The series, written by [[Denny O'Neil]] and penciled by [[Neal Adams]] (inking was by Adams or [[Dick Giordano]]), focused on \"relevance\" as Green Lantern was exposed to poverty and experienced self-doubt.<ref>Jacobs, Will, Gerard Jones (1985).

Retrieved 2011-10-23.</ref>\n\nLater in 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] left [[Marvel Comics]], ending arguably the most important creative partnership of the Silver Age (with [[Stan Lee]]). Kirby then turned to [[DC Comics|DC]], where he created ''[[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]'' series of titles starting with ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]] #133'' in December 1970. Also in 1970 [[Mort Weisinger]], the long term editor of the various [[Superman]] titles, retired to be replaced by [[Julius Schwartz]]. Schwartz set about toning down some of the more fanciful aspects of the Weisinger era, removing most [[Kryptonite]] from continuity and scaling back Superman's nigh-infinite\u2014by then\u2014powers, which was done by veteran Superman artist [[Curt Swan]] together with groundbreaking author [[Denny O'Neil]].\n\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age coincided with the end of the careers of many of the veteran writers and artists of the time, or their promotion to management positions and retirement from regular writing or drawing, and their replacement with a younger generation of editors and creators, many of whom knew each other from their experiences in comic book fan conventions and publications. At the same time, publishers began the era by scaling back on their super-hero publications, canceling many of the weaker-selling titles, and experimenting with other genres such as horror and sword-and-sorcery.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe era also encompassed major changes in the distribution of and audience for comic books. Over time, the medium shifted from cheap mass market products sold at [[newsstand]]s to a more expensive product sold at specialty comic book shops and aimed at a smaller, core audience of fans. The shift in distribution allowed many small-print publishers to enter the market, changing the medium from one dominated by a few large publishers to a more diverse and eclectic range of books.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==The 1970s==\n[[File:Green lantern 85.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' #85 (October 1971), one of the first comic stories to tackle the issue of drug use, cover art by [[Neal Adams]].]]\nIn 1970, Marvel published the first comic book issue of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s pulp character [[Conan the Barbarian]]. Conan's [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|success as a comic hero]] resulted in adaptations of other Howard characters: [[King Kull (DC Comics)|King Kull]], [[Red Sonja]], and [[Solomon Kane (comics)|Solomon Kane]].  DC Comics responded with comics featuring [[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]], [[Beowulf (DC Comics)|Beowulf]], and [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser#Comics adaptations|Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]]. They also took over the licensing of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s [[Tarzan (comics)#DC Comics|Tarzan]] from long-time publisher [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]] and began adapting other Burroughs creations, such as [[John Carter, Warlord of Mars|John Carter]], the [[Pellucidar|Pellucidar series]], and the [[Amtor#Comic books|Amtor series]].  Marvel also adapted to comic book form, with less success, [[Edwin Lester Arnold]]'s character [[Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation#In other media|Gullivar Jones]] and, later, [[Lin Carter]]'s [[Thongor of Lemuria#Marvel Comics adaptation|Thongor]].\n\nThe murder of [[Spider-Man]]'s longtime girlfriend, [[Gwen Stacy]], at the hands of the [[Green Goblin]] in 1973's ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #121-122 is considered by comics scholar Arnold T. Blumberg to be the definitive Bronze Age event, as it exemplifies the period's trend towards darker territory and willingness to subvert conventions such as the assumed survival of long-established, \"untouchable\" characters. However, there had been a gradual darkening of the tone of superhero comics for several years prior to \"[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]\", including the death of [[George Stacy|her father]] in 1970's ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #90 and the beginning of the [[Dennis O'Neil]]/[[Neal Adams]] tenure on ''Batman''.\n\nIn 1971, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Stan Lee was approached by the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part Spider-Man story, \"[[Green Goblin Reborn!]],\" which portrayed drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. At that time, any portrayal of drug use in comic books was banned outright by the [[Comics Code Authority]], regardless of the context. The CCA refused to approve the story, but Lee published it regardless.\n\nThe positive reception that the story received led to the CCA revising the Comics Code later that year to allow the portrayal of drug addiction as long as it was depicted in a negative light. Soon after, DC Comics had their own drug abuse storyline in ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Green Arrow]]'' #85-86. Written by [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] with art by [[Neal Adams]], the storyline was entitled \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]],\" and it revealed that the Green Arrow's sidekick [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] had become addicted to [[heroin]].\n\nThe 1971 revision to the Comics Code has also been seen as relaxing the rules on the use of vampires, ghouls and werewolves in comic books, allowing the growth of a number of supernatural and horror-oriented titles, such as ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', among numerous others. However, the tone of horror comic stories had already seen substantial changes between the relatively tame offerings of the early 1960s (e.g. ''Unusual Tales'') and the more violent products available in the late 1960s (e.g. ''The Witching Hour'', revised formats in ''House of Secrets'', ''House of Mystery'', ''The Unexpected'').\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, publishers moved away from the super-hero stories that enjoyed mass-market popularity in the mid-1960s; DC cancelled most of its super-hero titles other than those starring Superman and Batman, while Marvel cancelled weaker-selling titles such as ''Dr. Strange'', ''Sub-Mariner'' and ''The X-Men''. In their place, they experimented with a wide variety of other genres, including Westerns, horror and monster stories, and the above-mentioned adaptations of pulp adventures. These trends peaked in the early 1970s, and the medium reverted by the mid-1970s to selling predominantly super-hero titles.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Further developments==\n\n===Social relevance===\nA concern with social issues had been a part of comic book stories since their beginnings: early Superman stories, for example, dealt with issues such as child mistreatment and working conditions for [[Minor (law)|minors]]. However, in the 1970s relevance became not only a feature of the stories, but also something that the books loudly proclaimed on their covers to promote sales. The Spider-Man drug issues were at the forefront of the trend of \"social relevance\" with comic books noticeably handling real-life issues. The above-mentioned ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' series dealt not only with drugs, but other topics like racism and environmental degradation. The X-Men titles, which were partly based on the premise that mutants were a metaphor for real-world minorities, became wildly popular. Other well-known \"relevant\" comics include the  \"[[Demon in a Bottle]]\", where [[Iron Man]] confronts his alcoholism, and the socially conscious stories written by [[Steve Gerber]] in such titles as ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' and ''[[Omega the Unknown]]''. Issues regarding female empowerment became trends with female versions of popular male characters ([[Spider-Woman]], [[Red Sonja]], [[Ms. Marvel]], [[She-Hulk]]).\n\n===Creator credit and labor agreements===\nWriters and artists began getting a lot more credit for their creations even though they were still ceding copyrights to the companies for whom they worked. Pencil Artists were allowed to keep their original artwork and sell it on the open market.  When word got out that Superman's creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] were living in poverty, artists such as Neal Adams, [[Jerry Robinson]], and [[Bernie Wrightson]] helped organize fellow artists to pressure DC in rectifying them and other pioneers from the 1930s and 1940s. Newer publishers, such as Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, negotiated contracts in which creators retained copyright to their creations.\n\n===Minority superheroes===\nOne of the most significant developments during the period was a substantial rise in the number of black and other non-white minority superheroes. Before the 1970s, there had been very few non-white superheroes ([[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] being notable exceptions) but starting in the early 1970s this began to change with the introduction of characters such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Luke Cage]] (who was the first black superhero to star in his own comic book in 1972) of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],  [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Monica Rambeau]] of the Avengers, [[Misty Knight]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[DC (comics)|DC]]'s Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], [[Bronze Tiger]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] of [[Teen Titans]] many of whom were black (with the exception of Shang-Chi himself). Additionally, Jewish superheroes became more visible with the appearances of Marvel's [[Kitty Pryde]] of the X-Men and [[Moon Knight]] respectively.\n\nCharacters such as Luke Cage, [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], Misty Knight, Shang-Chi, and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] have been seen by some as an attempt by Marvel Comics to cash in on the 1970s crazes for [[Kung Fu]] movies. However, these and other minority characters came into their own after these film trends faded, and became increasingly popular and important as time progressed. By the mid-1980s, Storm and Cyborg had become leaders of the [[X-Men]] and [[Teen Titans]] respectively, and John Stewart briefly replaced [[Hal Jordan]] as the lead character of the ''[[Green Lantern]]'' title.\n\n===Art styles===\nStarting with Neal Adams' work in ''Green Lantern/Green Arrow'' a newly sophisticated realism became the norm in the industry. Buyers would no longer be interested in the heavily stylized work of artists of the Silver Age or simpler cartooning of the Golden Age. The so-called \"House Styles\" of DC and Marvel became imitations of Adams' work and much more realistic versions of Kirby's respectively. This change is sometimes credited to a new generation of artists influenced by the popularity of [[EC Comics]] in the 1950s. In spite of the House Styles, those artists who could draw apart from these would gain some notoriety. Such names include [[Berni Wrightson]], [[Jim Aparo]], [[Jim Starlin]], [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[George P\u00e9rez]], and [[Howard Chaykin]].  A secondary line of comics at DC, headed by former EC Comics artist Joe Orlando and devoted to horror titles, established a differing set of styles and aggressively sought talent from Asia and Latin America.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===The revival of the X-Men and the Teen Titans===\nThe [[X-Men]] were originally created in 1963 by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. However, the title never achieved the popularity of other Lee/Kirby creations, and by 1970 Marvel ceased publishing new material and the title was turned over to reprints. But in 1975 an \"all-new all-different\" version of the X-Men was introduced by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Cockrum]] in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, with Chris Claremont as uncredited assistant co-plotter.<ref>Chris Claremont's role in this issue is mentioned in ''Official Marvel Index to the X-Men'' #4, November 1987</ref> Claremont stayed as writer on just about all X-Men related titles, including spinoffs, for the next sixteen years, after which other regular writers such as Louise Simonson, Fabian Nicieza, and Scott Lobdell joined and Claremont eventually left.\n\nOne of the most apparent influences from this series was the creation of what became DC Comics' answer to X-Men's character-based storytelling style, ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George P\u00e9rez]], which became a highly successful and influential property in its own right. Wolfman would associate himself with the title for sixteen years, while Perez established a large fan base and sought-after pencilling style. A [[Teen Titans (TV series)|successful cartoon]] based on the Titans of the Bronze Age of Comics was launched in 2003, and lasted for four years.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Team-up books and anthologies===\nDuring the Silver Age, comic books frequently had several features, a form harkening back to the Golden Age when the first comics were anthologies. In 1968, Marvel graduated its double feature characters appearing in their anthologies to full-length stories in their own comic. But several of these characters could not sustain their own title and were cancelled. Marvel tried to create new double feature anthologies such as ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' and ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' which did not last as double feature comic books. A more enduring concept was that of the team-up book, either combining two characters, at least one of which was not popular enough to sustain its own title (''Green Lantern/Green Arrow''). Even DC combined two features in ''[[Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' and had team-up books (''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]''). Virtually all such books disappeared by the end of the period.\n\n===Company crossovers===\nMarvel and DC worked out several crossover titles the first of which was ''[[Superman vs. The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. This was followed by a second Superman and Spider-Man, ''Batman vs. the Incredible Hulk'' and the ''[[The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans|X-Men vs The New Teen Titans]]''. Another title, ''The Avengers vs. the Justice League of America'' was written by [[Gerry Conway]] and drawn by [[George P\u00e9rez]] with plotting by Roy Thomas, but was never published, reflecting the later animosity between the two companies. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter was not pleased that DC wanted the fourth company crossover to include the New Teen Titans, DC's best-selling title at the time, as he wanted the crossover to be the X-Men and the Legion of Super-Heroes. This led to Shooter's decision to stall and cancel the JLA/Avengers project.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Reprints===\nBeginning circa 1970, Marvel introduced vast numbers of reprints into the market, which played a key role in their becoming the overall market leader among comic publishers. Suddenly many titles featured reprints:  ''X-Men'', ''Sgt. Fury'', ''[[Kid Colt Outlaw]]'', ''Rawhide Kid'', ''Two-Gun Kid'', ''Outlaw Kid'', ''Jungle Action'', ''Special Marvel Edition'' (the early issues), ''War is Hell'' (the early issues), ''Creatures on the Loose'', ''Monsters on the Prowl'', and ''FEAR'', to name just a few.\n\n===DC Implosion===\nIn the mid-'70s, DC launched numerous new titles such as [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[New Gods]]'' and [[Steve Ditko]]'s ''[[Shade the Changing Man]]''. [[Jenette Kahn]] would eventually take the helm of the company in 1976. The company followed this up in 1978 with the \"[[DC Explosion]]\" where the standard line of books increased in page count and 50 cent price. Many of these titles added backup features with various characters. However, DC greatly overestimated the appeal of so many new titles at once, sales dropped severely during the harsh 1978 winter and it nearly broke the company and the industry, including [[Charlton Comics]]; this event has been called the \"[[DC Implosion]]\".\n\nMarvel eventually gained 50% of the market and Stan Lee handed control of the comic division to [[Jim Shooter]] while he worked with their growing animation spin-offs.\n\n===Non-superhero comics===\nAs the Bronze Age began in the early 1970s, popularity shifted away from the established superhero genre towards comic book titles from which superheroes were absent altogether. These non-superhero comics were typically inspired by genres like Westerns or fantasy & pulp fiction.  As previously noted, 1971's revised Comics Code left the horror genre ripe for development and several supernaturally-themed series resulted, such as the popular ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[Swamp Thing]]''.  In the science fiction genre, [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] survival stories were an early trend, as evidenced by characters like ''[[Deathlok]]'', ''[[Killraven]]'', and ''[[Kamandi]]''. The long-running sci-fi/fantasy anthology comic magazine ''[[Metal Hurlant]]'' and its American counterpart ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' began publishing in the late '70s.  Marvel's ''[[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Star Wars]]'' series was very popular with a nine-year run.\n\nOther titles began from characters originally found in 20th century pulp magazines or novels.  Noteworthy examples are the long running titles ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' (the latter was published as a magazine, bypassing the Comics Code),  as well as ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung-Fu]]''.  The early success of these titles soon led to more pulp character adaptations  (''[[Doc Savage]]'', ''[[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]]'', ''[[The Shadow]]'', ''[[Justice, Inc.]]'', ''[[Tarzan]]'').  During this period, both Marvel and DC also regularly published official comic book adaptations for various projects, including popular movies (''[[Planet of the Apes (comics)#Marvel Comics|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Godzilla Squad|Godzilla]]'', ''[[Logan's Run]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones comic books|Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[Jaws 2]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Star Wars comics|Star Wars]]''), TV shows (''The [[Man from Atlantis]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (comics)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[List of Star Trek comic books|Star Trek]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[Welcome Back Kotter]]''), toys (''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel Comics)|G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]]'', ''[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'', ''[[Rom the Spaceknight|Rom]]'', ''[[Atari Force]]'', ''[[Thundercats]]''), and even public figures ([[Kiss (comics)|Kiss]], [[John Tartaglione|Pope John Paul II]]).\n\nThough not necessarily \"non-superhero\", a few unconventional comic book series from the period featured one or more villains as their central character (''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', ''[[Secret Society of Super-Villains]]'', ''The [[Joker (comic book)|Joker]]'').\n\n==Alternate markets and formats==\n[[Archie Comics]] dominated the female market during this time with their characters, [[Betty and Veronica]] having some of the largest circulation of titular female characters. Several clones were attempted by Marvel and DC unsuccessfully. Several Archie titles examined socially relevant issues and introduced a few African-American characters.  Archie largely switched to [[paperback]] [[digest size|digest format]] in the late 1980s.\n\nChildren's comics were still popular with Disney reprints under the [[Gold Key]] label along with [[Harvey Comics|Harvey]]'s stable of characters which grew in popularity. The latter included ''[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]'', ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]]'', and ''[[Wendy the Good Little Witch|Wendy]]'', which eventually switched to digest format as well. Again Marvel and DC were unable to emulate their success with competing titles.\n\nAn 'explicit content' market akin to the niche [[Underground Comix]] of the late '60s was ostensibly opened with the Franco-Belgian import ''[[Heavy Metal Magazine]]''. Marvel launched competing magazine titles of their own with ''Conan the Barbarian'' and ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' which would eventually become its division of Direct Sales comics.\n\nThe paper drives of [[World War II]] and a growing nostalgia among [[Baby Boom|Baby-Boomers]] in the 1970s made comic books of the 1930s and 1940s extremely valuable. DC experimented with some large size paperback books to reprint their Golden Age comics, create one-shot stories such as ''[[All-New Collectors' Edition|Superman vs. Shazam]]'' and ''[[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali]]'' as well as the early Marvel crossovers.\n\nThe popularity of those early books also opened up a market for specialty shops. The existence of these shops made it possible for small-press publishers to reach an audience, and some comic book artists began self-publishing their own work. Notable titles of this type included [[Dave Sim]]'s ''[[Cerebus]]'' and [[Wendy and Richard Pini]]'s ''[[Elfquest]]'' series. Other small-press publishers came in to take advantage of this growing market: [[Pacific Comics]] introduced in 1981 a line of books by comic-book veterans such as Jack Kirby, Mike Grell and [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]], for which the artists retained copyright and shared in royalties.\n\nIn 1978, [[Will Eisner]] published his \"[[graphic novel]]\" ''[[A Contract With God]]'', an attempt to produce a long-format story outside the traditional comic book genres. In the early 1980s [[Art Spiegelman]] and [[Fran\u00e7oise Mouly]] began publishing ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw Magazine]]'', which included the early serialization of Spiegelman's award-winning graphic novel ''[[Maus]]''.\n\nComics sold on newsstands were distributed on the basis that unsold copies were returned to the publisher. Comics sold to comic shops were sold on a no-return basis. This allowed small-press titles sold through the direct market to keep publishing costs down and increase profits, making viable titles that otherwise would have been unprofitable. Marvel and DC began taking advantage of this direct market themselves, publishing books and titles distributed only through comic book shops.\n\n===Disappearing genres===\n\nThis period is also marked by the cancellation of most titles in the genres of romance, western and war stories that had been a mainstay of comics production since the forties. Most anthologies, whether they presented feature characters or not, also disappeared. They had been used since the Golden Age to create new characters, to host characters that lost their own title or to feature several characters. This had the effect of standardizing the length of comics stories within a narrow range so that multiple stand-alone stories would appear within a single issue.  The [[underground comix]] of the 1960s counterculture continued, but contracted significantly and were ultimately subsumed into the emerging [[direct market]].\n\n==End of the Bronze Age==\nOne commonly used ending point for the Bronze Age is the 1985\u20131986 time frame. As with the Silver Age, the end of the Bronze Age relates to a number of trends and events that happened at around the same time. At this point, DC Comics completed its special event, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' which marked the revitalization of the company's product line to become a serious market contender against Marvel, as happened before. This time frame also includes the company's release of the highly acclaimed works, ''[[Watchmen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], which redefined the superhero genre and inspired years of \"grim and gritty\" comic books.\n\nAt Marvel Comics, the commonly used milestone marking the end of the Bronze Age is ''[[Secret Wars]]'', although this could be extended to 1986 which saw the cancellation of ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'', as well as the launch of the [[New Universe]] and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (extension of the X-Men franchise).\n\nAfter the Bronze Age came the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], alternatively referred to as the Dark Age of Comic Books. According to Shawn O'Rourke of [[PopMatters]], the shift from the previous ages involved a \"deconstructive and dystopian re-envisioning of iconic characters and the worlds that they live in\",<ref name=\"O'Rourke\"/> as typified by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986) and [[Alan Moore]]'s and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' (1986\u20131987). Other features that define the era are an increase in adult oriented content, the rise of the [[X-Men]] as Marvel Comics' \"dominant intellectual property\", and a reorganization of the industry's distribution system.<ref name=\"O'Rourke\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/50380/a-new-era-infinite-crisis-civil-war-and-the-end-of-the-modern-age-of-comics/ |title=A New Era: Infinite Crisis, Civil War, and the End of the Modern Age of Comics |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=O'Rourke |first=Shawn |date=22 February 2008 |publisher=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref>\nThese changes would also lead to the appearance of new independent comic book publishers in the early 1990s - such as [[Image Comics]], with titles like ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' and ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' which also boasted a darker, sarcastic and more mature approach to superhero storylines.\n\n==Noted Bronze Age talents==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Writers'''\n* [[T.
