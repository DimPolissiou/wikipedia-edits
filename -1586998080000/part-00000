Before co-creating [[CBS]]' ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', the writer-producer shot some test footage on which ABC ultimately passed. Prady's history with The Muppets dates back to his work on ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' in 1987. His previous writing credits for Muppet productions include the ''[[Muppet*Vision 3D]]'' attraction at [[Walt Disney World]], and the tribute special ''[[The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson]]'', which earned Prady an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 1991.<ref name=\"Muppets Revival\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Jim Henson Remembered: \u2018Muppets\u2019 Producer Bill Prady Pays Tribute to His Legendary Mentor|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/jim-henson-muppets-big-bang-theory-bill-prady-1201496535/|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=Variety|date=May 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nExecutive producer Bob Kushell explained the intention behind the series; \"We have the opportunity to explore these characters as individuals with their own emotional lives that are separate from each other and aren't shadowed by each other's presence, as I think they have been for the last 20 years... it's not just a behind-the-scenes look at a show, but it's the relationship-driven, emotional stories that people go through in their personal lives.

''The Muppets'' was picked up by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the same network that aired ''Muppets Tonight''\u2014as the characters, the network, and the production companies are all owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014on the ABC network schedule.\n\nThis marks the second time Prady has attempted to revive The Muppets. Before co-creating [[CBS]]' ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', the writer-producer shot some test footage on which ABC ultimately passed. Prady's history with The Muppets dates back to his work on ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' in 1987. His previous writing credits for Muppet productions include the ''[[Muppet*Vision 3D]]'' attraction at [[Walt Disney World]], and the tribute special ''[[The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson]]'', which earned Prady an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 1991.<ref name=\"Muppets Revival\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Jim Henson Remembered: \u2018Muppets\u2019 Producer Bill Prady Pays Tribute to His Legendary Mentor|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/jim-henson-muppets-big-bang-theory-bill-prady-1201496535/|accessdate=September 18, 2015|work=Variety|date=May 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nExecutive producer Bob Kushell explained the intention behind the series; \"We have the opportunity to explore these characters as individuals with their own emotional lives that are separate from each other and aren't shadowed by each other's presence, as I think they have been for the last 20 years... it's not just a behind-the-scenes look at a show, but it's the relationship-driven, emotional stories that people go through in their personal lives.

Two years after his birth, his family moved to [[Zaporizhia|Alexandrovsk]] ([[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]]), where Stepan graduated from city school and joined the local ironworks as a metalworker. \nIn 1913 Petrichenko was called up for military service with the Russian navy, where he was assigned to the Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1911)|''Petropavlovsk'']], part of the [[Baltic Fleet]].<ref name=tragedy> {{cite web | author = Prokhorov D | url = http://konkretno.ru/proekty/version_in_spb/10_ot_17032003/ | title = The tragedy of the Kronstadt \"rebel\" | publisher = | accessdate = 2008-11-29 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68ARC2g4m?Url=http://konkretno.ru/proekty/version_in_spb/10_ot_17032003/ | archivedate = 2012-06-04 | language = ru}} </ref>\n\n=== Soviet republic of sailors and builders ===\n{{Main article|Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders of Naissaar}}\nDuring the [[February Revolution]] in Russia, he had been with the fleet at the Estonian island [[Naissaar|Nargen]] (now ''Naissaar''). In December 1917, the [[Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders of Nargen]] was proclaimed. Eighty-two sailors and about two hundred indigenous islanders organized local government, which lasted until the capture of Tallinn by the forces of the [[German Empire]] on February 26, 1918. The red and black flag of the [[anarcho-communists]] was lowered, and its \u201cgovernment\u201d retreated onto the ships of the Baltic Fleet, heading for [[Helsinki]], and from there to [[Kronstadt]]. Three years later, a red-black banner also hoisted over Kronstadt - the former leader of the Nargen \"republic\" Stepan Maksimovich Petrichenko led the Kronstadt uprising.<ref name=estonia>[http://www.turismiweb.ee/lt/news/1948/ Naissaar.

Returning in the summer of 1920 from a visit to Aleksandrovsk (modern [[Zaporizhia]]), he praised [[Makhnovism]], but he did not become an anarchist by conviction. He was not a career officer in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] fleet, and when he took the responsibility of guiding the fleet he was an engineer on the battleship ''Petropavlovsk''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Kronstadt rebellion===\n{{Main article|Kronstadt rebellion}}\nIn March 1921, with the outbreak of unrest in Kronstadt, he headed the governing body of the uprising - the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, but showed no political talents.

He blocked further emigration to Helsinki, instead sending Kronstadt \"volunteers\" to [[Soviet Karelia]] in order to organize an uprising. He called on Kronstadters to not obey the order of [[General Wrangel]], and refuse inclusion in the [[White Army]]. When an amnesty was declared for the ordinary participants in the uprising, by the decree of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], Petrichenko didn\u2019t put obstacles in the way of those who wanted to return to their homeland and decided to ask for permission to return himself. Soon, the police chief of [[Vyborg]] received a denunciation of the \u201cvile plot\u201d of Petrichenko, as a result of which, on May 21, 1922 he was arrested and spent several months in prison. <ref name=tragedy/>\n\n===Agent===\nIn 1922, Petrichenko went to [[Riga]] and visited the embassy of the [[RSFSR]].

In 1937, he announced his refusal to cooperate with Soviet intelligence, but then again agreed to continue working with them. He stayed in Finland for years, until he came into conflict with the Finnish government over his support of Soviet groups during the [[Winter War]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and Finland in 1940.

Two years after his birth, his family moved to [[Zaporizhia|Alexandrovsk]] ([[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]]), where Stepan graduated from city school and joined the local ironworks as a metalworker. \nIn 1913 Petrichenko was called up for military service with the Russian navy, where he was assigned to the Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Petropavlovsk (1911)|''Petropavlovsk'']], part of the [[Baltic Fleet]].<ref name=tragedy> {{cite web | author = Prokhorov D | url = http://konkretno.ru/proekty/version_in_spb/10_ot_17032003/ | title = The tragedy of the Kronstadt \"rebel\" | publisher = | accessdate = 2008-11-29 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68ARC2g4m?Url=http://konkretno.ru/proekty/version_in_spb/10_ot_17032003/ | archivedate = 2012-06-04 | language = ru}} </ref>\n\n=== Soviet republic of sailors and builders ===\n{{Main article|Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders of Naissaar}}\nDuring the [[February Revolution]] in Russia, he had been with the fleet at the Estonian island [[Naissaar|Nargen]] (now ''Naissaar''). In December 1917, the [[Soviet Republic of Soldiers and Fortress-Builders of Nargen]] was proclaimed. Eighty-two sailors and about two hundred indigenous islanders organized local government, which lasted until the capture of Tallinn by the forces of the [[German Empire]] on February 26, 1918. The red and black flag of the [[anarcho-communists]] was lowered, and its \u201cgovernment\u201d retreated onto the ships of the Baltic Fleet, heading for [[Helsinki]], and from there to [[Kronstadt]]. Three years later, a red-black banner also hoisted over Kronstadt - the former leader of the Nargen \"republic\" Stepan Maksimovich Petrichenko led the Kronstadt uprising.<ref name=estonia>[http://www.turismiweb.ee/lt/news/1948/ Naissaar.

Returning in the summer of 1920 from a visit to Aleksandrovsk (modern [[Zaporizhia]]), he praised [[Makhnovism]], but he did not become an anarchist by conviction. He was not a career officer in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] fleet, and when he took the responsibility of guiding the fleet he was an engineer on the battleship ''Petropavlovsk''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Kronstadt rebellion===\n{{Main article|Kronstadt rebellion}}\nIn March 1921, with the outbreak of unrest in Kronstadt, he headed the governing body of the uprising - the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, but showed no political talents.

He blocked further emigration to Helsinki, instead sending Kronstadt \"volunteers\" to [[Soviet Karelia]] in order to organize an uprising. He called on Kronstadters to not obey the order of [[General Wrangel]], and refuse inclusion in the [[White Army]]. When an amnesty was declared for the ordinary participants in the uprising, by the decree of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]], Petrichenko didn\u2019t put obstacles in the way of those who wanted to return to their homeland and decided to ask for permission to return himself. Soon, the police chief of [[Vyborg]] received a denunciation of the \u201cvile plot\u201d of Petrichenko, as a result of which, on May 21, 1922 he was arrested and spent several months in prison. <ref name=tragedy/>\n\n===Agent===\nIn 1922, Petrichenko went to [[Riga]] and visited the embassy of the [[RSFSR]].

The band issued a statement expressing disappointment that fans were hearing material that was unfinished, and they worked to release a completed, better quality version of the album, which became ''Steal This Album!''.\n\n==Album information==\nThough often reported in the media as being a collection of B-sides and outtakes, the band insisted that the ''Steal This Album!'' material is of the same quality as the tracks which made it onto ''Toxicity''. Vocalist [[Serj Tankian]] has said that the songs were left out of ''Toxicity'' \"because they did not fit the overall continuity of the album\". In May 2009, drummer [[John Dolmayan]] revealed that the album is his favorite System of a Down release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stereokill.net/2009/05/17/interview-john-dolmayan-system-of-a-down-scars-on-broadway/ |title=Interview: John Dolmayan (System of a Down/Scars on Broadway) |access-date=2009-05-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415133452/http://stereokill.net/2009/05/17/interview-john-dolmayan-system-of-a-down-scars-on-broadway/ |archive-date=April 15, 2014 |df= }}</ref> Similarly, Tankian also called the album his favorite System of a Down album in a 2012 [[Reddit#IAmA and AMA|AMA]] on [[reddit]]<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/w44co/i_am_serj_tankian_ama/c5a2taa/?context=1</ref>.\n\nA first version of \"Streamline\" was used in ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' soundtrack, which was released in early 2002, and as a B-side on the CD2 edition of \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\".\n\nAfter the end of the band's hiatus in 2011, the only songs to have been played from the album are \"Pictures\", \"Highway Song\", \"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\", \"Mr. Jack\", \"[[Innervision]]\", and \"Roulette\".

{"title_page": "National parks of England and Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe '''national parks of England and Wales''' are areas of relatively undeveloped and scenic landscape that are designated under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] (save for the Broads which was set up under the [[Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988]]). Despite their similar name, national parks in [[England and Wales]] are quite different from [[national park]]s in many other countries, which are usually owned and managed by the government as a protected community resource, and which do not usually include permanent human communities. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership.\n\nThere are currently thirteen national parks ({{lang-cy|parciau cenedlaethol}}) in England and Wales. Each park is operated by its own [[national park authority]], with two \"statutory purposes\":\n# to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, [[wildlife]] and cultural heritage of the area, and\n# to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the park's special qualities by the public.\n\nThe Broads differs from the other twelve in having a third purpose which carries equal weight; that of \u2018protecting the interests of navigation\u2019. \n\nWhen national parks carry out these purposes they also have the duty to:\n# seek to foster the economic and social well-being of local communities within the national parks.\n\nAn estimated 110 million people visit the national parks of England and Wales each year. Recreation and tourism bring visitors and funds into the parks, to sustain their [[conservation ethic|conservation]] efforts and support the local population through jobs and businesses. These visitors also bring problems, such as [[erosion]] and [[traffic congestion]], and conflicts over the use of the parks' resources. Access to cultivated land is restricted to [[Rights of way in England and Wales|public rights of way]] and [[Rights of way in England and Wales#Permissive path|permissive paths]], with most (but not all) uncultivated areas in England and Wales having right of access for walking under the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:brecon beacons arp.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the [[Brecon Beacons|Brecon Beacons National Park]], looking from the highest point of [[Pen y Fan]] (886&nbsp;m/2907&nbsp;feet) to Cribyn (795&nbsp;m/2608&nbsp;feet).]]\n[[File:Wastwater, Yewbarrow and Great Gable - geograph.org.uk - 1546772.jpg|thumb|The head of Wasdale - this view appears on the logo of the Lake District National Park Authority]]\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence from [[prehistoric Britain]] shows that the areas now designated as national parks have been occupied by humans since the [[Stone Age]], at least 5,000 years ago and in some cases much earlier.\n\nBefore the 19th century, relatively wild, remote areas were often seen simply as uncivilised and dangerous. In 1725 [[Daniel Defoe]] described the [[Peak District|High Peak]] as \"the most desolate, wild and abandoned country in all England\".<ref>Defoe, Daniel. ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, Divided into Circuits or {{sic|hide=y|Journies}}.'' (1724\u201326) \"There is indeed an extended angle of this county, which runs a great way north west by Chappel in the Frith, and which they call High Peak. This, perhaps, is the most desolate, wild, and abandoned country in all England; The mountains of the Peak, of which I have been speaking, seem to be but the beginning of wonders to this part of the country, and but the beginning of mountains, or, if you will, as the lower rounds of a ladder. The tops of these hills seem to be as much above the clouds, as the clouds are above the ordinary range of hills.\"</ref> However, by the early 19th century, [[Romantic Poetry|romantic poets]] such as [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] wrote about the inspirational beauty of the \"untamed\" countryside.<ref name=\"natparks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/filex_01.pdf |title=Our National Parks - Filex 1 |accessdate=3 December 2007 |format=PDF |work=Exmoor National Park |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228002224/http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/filex_01.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008 }}</ref> Wordsworth described the [[Lake District|English Lake District]] as a \"sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\" in 1810. This early vision, based in the [[Picturesque]] movement, took over a century, and much controversy, to take legal form in the UK with the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].\n\nThe idea for a form of national parks was first proposed in the [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|United States]] in the 1860s, where [[national park]]s were established to protect [[wilderness]] areas such as [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]. This model has been used in many other countries since, but not in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter thousands of years of human integration into the landscape, Britain lacks any substantial areas of wilderness. Furthermore, those areas of natural beauty so cherished by the romantic poets were often only maintained and managed in their existing state by human activity, usually agriculture.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |title=Can the threat to the UK\u2019s only true wilderness be seen off? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/nature-studies-can-the-threat-to-the-uk-s-only-true-wilderness-be-seen-off-10111842.html |accessdate=30 December 2019 |agency=The Independent |issue=Nature Studies |date=16 March 2015 |location=London |language=English |quote=\"In Britain, we have paid little heed to the concept of wilderness, partly because in the southern half of the country, at any rate, we have little of it: even the natural parks we eventually established, such as the Lake District or the Peak District, cover landscapes which may be mountainous, but are essentially farmed.\"}}</ref>\n\n===Government support is established===\nBy the early 1930s, increasing public interest in the countryside, coupled with the growing and newly mobile urban population, was generating increasing friction between those seeking access to the countryside and landowners. Alongside of direct action trespasses, such as the [[mass trespass of Kinder Scout]], several voluntary bodies took up the cause of public access in the political arena.\n\nIn 1931, [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] (later Lord Addison) chaired a government committee that proposed a 'National Park Authority' to choose areas for designation as national parks.<ref name=\"UKNPhistory\"/> A system of national reserves and nature sanctuaries was proposed:\n\n:\"(i) to safeguard areas of exceptional natural interest against (a) disorderly development and (b) spoliation; (ii) to improve the means of access for pedestrians to areas of natural beauty; and (iii) to promote measures for the protection of [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]].\"\n\nHowever, no further action was taken after the intervention of the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 General Election]].\n\nThe voluntary Standing Committee on National Parks first met on 26 May 1936 to put the case to the government for national parks in the UK. After World War II, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] proposed the establishment of national parks as part of the post-war reconstruction of the UK. A report by [[John Gordon Dower|John Dower]], secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks,<ref name=\"FAQS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/faqs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=5 December 2007 |work=National Parks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915022355/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/faqs.htm |archivedate=15 September 2007 }}</ref> to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945 was followed in 1947 by a Government committee, this time chaired by Sir [[Arthur Hobhouse]], which prepared legislation for national parks, and proposed twelve national parks. Sir Arthur had this to say on the criteria for designating suitable areas:\n\n<blockquote>The essential requirements of a National Park are that it should have great natural beauty, a high value for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent. Further, the distribution of selected areas should as far as practicable be such that at least one of them is quickly accessible from each of the main centres of population in [[England and Wales]]. Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, it would be wrong to confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.</blockquote>\n\n===National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949===\n[[Image:Northumberland National Park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hadrian's Wall]] crosses [[Northumberland National Park]]]]\n\nThe [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] was passed with all party support. The first ten national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural [[upland (geology)|upland]]. Much of the land was still owned by individual landowners, often private estates, but there was also property owned by public bodies such as [[the Crown]], or charities which allow and encourage access such as the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Accessibility from the [[City status in the United Kingdom#List of cities|cities]] was also considered important.\n\nOther areas were also considered: for example, parts of the coast of [[Cornwall]] were considered as a possible national park in the 1950s but were thought to be too disparate to form a single coherent national park and were eventually designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) instead. The north [[Pennines]] were also considered for designation as a national park in the 1970s but the proposal was thought to be administratively too difficult because the area was administered by five different [[county council]]s.\n\n===Later additions===\n[[The Broads]] in [[East Anglia]] are not in the strictest sense a national park, being run by a separately constituted Broads Authority set up by a special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1988<ref name=\"UKNPhistory\"/> and with a structure in which conservation is subordinate to navigational concerns (see [[Sandford Principle]] below), but it is generally regarded as being \"equivalent to\" a national park.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[New Forest]], which includes the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed pasture land, [[heath (habitat)|heathland]] and old-growth [[forest]] in the heavily populated [[South East England|south east]] of the country was designated as a national park on 1 March 2005.<ref name=\"NFfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/index/aboutus/frequently_asked_questions/faq-designation.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=New Forest National Park|accessdate=17 December 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905082742/http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/index/aboutus/frequently_asked_questions/faq-designation.htm|archivedate=5 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 2009, [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] [[Hilary Benn]] announced that the [[South Downs]] would be designated a national park.

The [[Peak District]] and the [[Lake District]], the first two national parks to be designated, were under the control of planning boards that were independent of the local county councils.\n\nEach authority is required to carry out two \"statutory purposes\":<ref name=\"natparks\"/>\n# to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area; and\n# to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the parks' special qualities by the public.\nThese purposes can conflict: in such cases, under the \"[[Sandford Principle]]\", conservation comes first. This principle was given [[statute|statutory]] force by section 62 of the [[Environment Act 1995]], although there are no explicit provisions as to how wildlife is to be preserved. In pursuing these purposes, national park authorities also have a duty to foster the social and economic well-being of their local communities.\n\nSlightly over half the members of each national park authority are appointees from the principal local authorities covered by the park; the remainder are appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (in England) or the [[Welsh Ministers]] (in Wales), some to represent local [[civil parish|parish]] or [[community (Wales)|community]] councils, others selected to represent the \"national interest\".<ref name=\"natparks\"/> The Broads Authority also has members appointed by [[Natural England]], [[Great Yarmouth]] Port Authority and the [[Environment Agency]]. The national park authorities and the Broads Authority are covered by similar regulatory controls to those applied to local councils.\n\nFunding for national parks is complex, but the full cost of each park authority is funded from central government funds. In the past this was partly paid for by local authorities, and refunded to them from the government to varying degrees. In 2003/2004, the park authorities received around \u00a335.5 million of central government funding.<!-- needs updating -->\n\n[[Natural England]] is the statutory body responsible for designating new national parks in England, subject to approval by the Secretary of State; [[Natural Resources Wales]] designates new national parks in Wales, subject to approval by the Welsh Ministers. The [[Association of National Park Authorities]] exists to provide the park authorities with a single voice when dealing with government and its agencies. The [[Campaign for National Parks]] (formerly Council for National Parks) is a charity that works to protect and enhance the national parks of England and Wales.\n\n==Development and land use planning in national parks==\nNational park authorities are the strategic and local planning authorities for their areas, so that the local district or unitary councils do not exercise planning control in an area covered by a national park. Consequently, they have to perform all the duties of a [[local planning authority]].\n\nThey are responsible for maintaining the [[local development framework]] &mdash; the [[spatial planning]] guide for their area. They also grant planning consent for development, within the constraints of the Framework. This gives them very strong direct control over residential and industrial development, and the design of buildings and other structures; as well as strategic matters such as mineral extraction.\n\nThe national park authorities' planning powers vary only slightly from other authorities, but the policies and their interpretation are stricter than elsewhere. This is supported and encouraged by the government who regard:\n:\"National Park designation as conferring the highest status of protection as far as landscape and scenic beauty are concerned.\" The Countryside &mdash; Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development (1997)<!-- needs full biblio ref -->\n\n==Contribution to the local economy==\nTourism is an important part of the economy of the regions which contain national parks. Through attractions, shops and accommodation, visitors provide an income and a livelihood to local employers and farmers. This income provides jobs for the park. For example, within the Peak District National Park the estimate in 2004 for visitor spending is \u00a3185 million, which supports over 3,400 jobs, representing 27% of total employment in the national park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/tourism.pdf|title=Tourism in the Peak District National Park: fact sheet 2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530101439/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/tourism.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Conflicts in national parks==\nThe national park authorities have two roles: to conserve and enhance the park, and to promote its use by visitors. These two objectives cause frequent conflicts between the needs of different groups of people. It is estimated that the national parks of England and Wales receive 110 million visitors each year. Most of the time it is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by good management. Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the [[Sandford Principle]], the [[Environment Act 1995]] sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks.\n\nAlthough recreation and tourism brings many benefits to an area, it also brings a number of problems. The national funding offered to national park authorities is partly in recognition of the extra difficulties created in dealing with these conflicts.\n; '''Congestion of villages and beauty spots''' : Some of the most popular \"[[honeypot (geography)|honeypot]]\" areas attract large numbers of visitors, resulting in overcrowded [[car park]]s, blocked roads, and overstretched local facilities, particularly on Sundays in the summer and on [[bank holiday]]s. Examples include the areas near [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the Lake District and [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] and [[Bakewell]] in the Peak District. Also [[Betws-y-Coed]] in [[Snowdonia]].\n; '''Erosion''' : [[Hill-walking]] and use of other public [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights-of-way]] is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use of the most popular paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be unsightly. Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by [[Trail riding|horse riding]] on unsurfaced [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s, [[mountain biking]] and use of [[off-road vehicle]]s on [[green lane (road)|green lane]]s. Examples include [[Dovedale]] in the Peak District. [[Over-grazing]], for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.\n; '''Damage and disturbance to wildlife''' : [[Wildlife]] may be disturbed by the level of use on some of the areas of the parks that are open to the public. [[Moorland]] and [[chalk downland]] is easily damaged by regular use, and takes many years to recover. Moorland birds in particular nest and roost on the ground and are therefore especially sensitive. [[Orienteering]], [[mountain biking]] and [[hang gliding]] are typical activities which are likely to cause disturbance to nesting birds.\n; '''Litter''' : Litter of all kinds is both unsightly and can cause pollution and damage to livestock and wild animals. Broken glass is a danger to people and, by [[Focus (optics)|focus]]ing the rays of the sun, a possible cause of fire, particularly in areas of moorland such as [[Exmoor]], parts of the [[Peak District]] and the [[North York Moors]].\n; '''Damage to farmland''' : Trampling of grass [[meadow]]s reduces the amount of winter feed for farm animals. Walkers who stray from footpaths may climb over fences or [[dry stone wall]]s rather than looking out for the [[stile]]s that mark the course of footpaths across farmland. Sheep can be injured or even killed by dogs not under proper control, especially at lambing time.\n; '''Local community displacement''' : Gift shops and [[caf\u00e9]]s which cater for the needs of tourists are often more profitable than shops selling everyday goods for local people (such as butchers or bakers). In some villages where tourist shops are in the majority and there are few shops catering for the local people, the local community may feel pushed out by the tourists. Houses are often very expensive in tourist villages as there is demand for them as [[Vacation property|second homes]] or [[holiday home]]s by [[holiday cottage]] firms or well-off people who live elsewhere, or who move to a local home from which they commute to work, making them unaffordable for local people. This is a particular problem in areas within easy commuting distance of large cities, such as the [[Peak District]], the [[Lake District]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], and the [[New Forest]] and [[South Downs]].\n; '''Conflict between recreational users''' : Some forms of use of national parks interfere with other uses. For example, use of high-speed [[boat]]s causes [[noise pollution]], and conflicts with other uses such as boat trips, yachting, canoeing, and swimming. A controversial [[bylaw]] imposing a 10&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knot]] speed limit came into force on [[Windermere]] on 29 March 2005. The new speed limit for Windermere effectively prohibits [[motorboat|speedboats]] and [[water skiing]] in the Lake District (of the 16 larger lakes in the [[Lake District]], only Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], [[Derwent Water]] and [[Ullswater]] have a public right of [[navigation]]; speed limits were imposed on the three lakes other than Windermere in the 1970s and 1980s).\n\n== List of national parks==\n{{main|List of national parks of England and Wales}}\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | \u2116\n! scope=\"col\" | National park\n! scope=\"col\" | Established<ref>{{Cite news |title=History of the National Parks |url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/history.htm |accessdate=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719195120/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/history.htm |archivedate=19 July 2012 }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | km\u00b2\n! scope=\"col\" | sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n| 1\n| [[Peak District]]\n| {{dts|17 April 1951}}\n| {{convert|1438|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 2\n| [[Lake District National Park|Lake District]]\n| {{dts|9 May 1951}}\n| {{convert|2362|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 3\n| [[Snowdonia National Park|Snowdonia]]<br/>({{lang-cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri|links=no}})\n| {{dts|18 October 1951}}\n| {{convert|2142|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 4\n| [[Dartmoor]]\n| {{dts|30 October 1951}}\n| {{convert|956|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 5\n| [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park|Pembrokeshire Coast]]<br/>({{lang-cy|Arfordir Penfro|links=no}})\n| {{dts|29 February 1952}}\n| {{convert|620|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 6\n| [[North York Moors]]\n| {{dts|28 November 1952}}\n| {{convert|1436|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 7\n| [[Yorkshire Dales National Park|Yorkshire Dales]]\n| {{dts|16 November 1954}}\n| {{convert|2178|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 8\n| [[Exmoor]]\n| {{dts|19 October 1954}}\n| {{convert|693|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 9\n| [[Northumberland National Park|Northumberland]]\n| {{dts|6 April 1956}}\n| {{convert|1049|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 10\n| [[Brecon Beacons National Park|Brecon Beacons]]<br/>({{lang-cy|Bannau Brycheiniog|links=no}})\n| {{dts|17 April 1957}}\n| {{convert|1351|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 11\n| [[The Broads]]\n| {{dts|1 April 1989}}\n| {{convert|303|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 12\n| [[New Forest National Park]]\n| {{dts|1 March 2005}}\n| {{convert|580|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 13\n| [[South Downs National Park|South Downs]]\n| {{dts|1 April 2010}}\n| {{convert|1641|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | Established total\n| {{convert|16749|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|}\n| style=\"width:310px;\"| [[File:National Parks in England and Wales.svg|300px|thumb|Thirteen areas are designated as national parks in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; the Broads now have 'equivalent status'.]]\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n|}\n\nUntil 2005, some 9.3% of the area of England and Wales lay within national parks; the addition of South Downs and the New Forest has increased this proportion to 10.7%.

Access to cultivated land is restricted to [[Rights of way in England and Wales|public rights of way]] and [[Rights of way in England and Wales#Permissive path|permissive paths]], with most (but not all) uncultivated areas in England and Wales having right of access for walking under the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:brecon beacons arp.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the [[Brecon Beacons|Brecon Beacons National Park]], looking from the highest point of [[Pen y Fan]] (886&nbsp;m/2907&nbsp;feet) to Cribyn (795&nbsp;m/2608&nbsp;feet).]]\n[[File:Wastwater, Yewbarrow and Great Gable - geograph.org.uk - 1546772.jpg|thumb|The head of Wasdale - this view appears on the logo of the Lake District National Park Authority]]\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence from [[prehistoric Britain]] shows that the areas now designated as national parks have been occupied by humans since the [[Stone Age]], at least 5,000 years ago and in some cases much earlier.\n\nBefore the 19th century, relatively wild, remote areas were often seen simply as uncivilised and dangerous. In 1725 [[Daniel Defoe]] described the [[Peak District|High Peak]] as \"the most desolate, wild and abandoned country in all England\".<ref>Defoe, Daniel. ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, Divided into Circuits or {{sic|hide=y|Journies}}.'' (1724\u201326) \"There is indeed an extended angle of this county, which runs a great way north west by Chappel in the Frith, and which they call High Peak. This, perhaps, is the most desolate, wild, and abandoned country in all England; The mountains of the Peak, of which I have been speaking, seem to be but the beginning of wonders to this part of the country, and but the beginning of mountains, or, if you will, as the lower rounds of a ladder. The tops of these hills seem to be as much above the clouds, as the clouds are above the ordinary range of hills.\"</ref> However, by the early 19th century, [[Romantic Poetry|romantic poets]] such as [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] wrote about the inspirational beauty of the \"untamed\" countryside.<ref name=\"natparks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/filex_01.pdf |title=Our National Parks - Filex 1 |accessdate=3 December 2007 |format=PDF |work=Exmoor National Park |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228002224/http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/filex_01.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008 }}</ref> Wordsworth described the [[Lake District|English Lake District]] as a \"sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\" in 1810. This early vision, based in the [[Picturesque]] movement, took over a century, and much controversy, to take legal form in the UK with the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].\n\nThe idea for a form of national parks was first proposed in the [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|United States]] in the 1860s, where [[national park]]s were established to protect [[wilderness]] areas such as [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]. This model has been used in many other countries since, but not in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter thousands of years of human integration into the landscape, Britain lacks any substantial areas of wilderness. Furthermore, those areas of natural beauty so cherished by the romantic poets were often only maintained and managed in their existing state by human activity, usually agriculture.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |title=Can the threat to the UK\u2019s only true wilderness be seen off? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/nature-studies-can-the-threat-to-the-uk-s-only-true-wilderness-be-seen-off-10111842.html |accessdate=30 December 2019 |agency=The Independent |issue=Nature Studies |date=16 March 2015 |location=London |language=English |quote=\"In Britain, we have paid little heed to the concept of wilderness, partly because in the southern half of the country, at any rate, we have little of it: even the natural parks we eventually established, such as the Lake District or the Peak District, cover landscapes which may be mountainous, but are essentially farmed.\"}}</ref>\n\n===Government support is established===\nBy the early 1930s, increasing public interest in the countryside, coupled with the growing and newly mobile urban population, was generating increasing friction between those seeking access to the countryside and landowners. Alongside of direct action trespasses, such as the [[mass trespass of Kinder Scout]], several voluntary bodies took up the cause of public access in the political arena.\n\nIn 1931, [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] (later Lord Addison) chaired a government committee that proposed a 'National Park Authority' to choose areas for designation as national parks.<ref name=\"UKNPhistory\"/> A system of national reserves and nature sanctuaries was proposed:\n\n:\"(i) to safeguard areas of exceptional natural interest against (a) disorderly development and (b) spoliation; (ii) to improve the means of access for pedestrians to areas of natural beauty; and (iii) to promote measures for the protection of [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]].\"\n\nHowever, no further action was taken after the intervention of the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 General Election]].\n\nThe voluntary Standing Committee on National Parks first met on 26 May 1936 to put the case to the government for national parks in the UK. After World War II, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] proposed the establishment of national parks as part of the post-war reconstruction of the UK. A report by [[John Gordon Dower|John Dower]], secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks,<ref name=\"FAQS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/faqs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=5 December 2007 |work=National Parks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915022355/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/faqs.htm |archivedate=15 September 2007 }}</ref> to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945 was followed in 1947 by a Government committee, this time chaired by Sir [[Arthur Hobhouse]], which prepared legislation for national parks, and proposed twelve national parks. Sir Arthur had this to say on the criteria for designating suitable areas:\n\n<blockquote>The essential requirements of a National Park are that it should have great natural beauty, a high value for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent. Further, the distribution of selected areas should as far as practicable be such that at least one of them is quickly accessible from each of the main centres of population in [[England and Wales]]. Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, it would be wrong to confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.</blockquote>\n\n===National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949===\n[[Image:Northumberland National Park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hadrian's Wall]] crosses [[Northumberland National Park]]]]\n\nThe [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] was passed with all party support. The first ten national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural [[upland (geology)|upland]]. Much of the land was still owned by individual landowners, often private estates, but there was also property owned by public bodies such as [[the Crown]], or charities which allow and encourage access such as the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Accessibility from the [[City status in the United Kingdom#List of cities|cities]] was also considered important.\n\nOther areas were also considered: for example, parts of the coast of [[Cornwall]] were considered as a possible national park in the 1950s but were thought to be too disparate to form a single coherent national park and were eventually designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) instead. The north [[Pennines]] were also considered for designation as a national park in the 1970s but the proposal was thought to be administratively too difficult because the area was administered by five different [[county council]]s.\n\n===Later additions===\n[[The Broads]] in [[East Anglia]] are not in the strictest sense a national park, being run by a separately constituted Broads Authority set up by a special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1988<ref name=\"UKNPhistory\"/> and with a structure in which conservation is subordinate to navigational concerns (see [[Sandford Principle]] below), but it is generally regarded as being \"equivalent to\" a national park.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[New Forest]], which includes the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed pasture land, [[heath (habitat)|heathland]] and old-growth [[forest]] in the heavily populated [[South East England|south east]] of the country was designated as a national park on 1 March 2005.<ref name=\"NFfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/index/aboutus/frequently_asked_questions/faq-designation.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=New Forest National Park|accessdate=17 December 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905082742/http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/index/aboutus/frequently_asked_questions/faq-designation.htm|archivedate=5 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 2009, [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] [[Hilary Benn]] announced that the [[South Downs]] would be designated a national park.

The [[Peak District]] and the [[Lake District]], the first two national parks to be designated, were under the control of planning boards that were independent of the local county councils.\n\nEach authority is required to carry out two \"statutory purposes\":<ref name=\"natparks\"/>\n# to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area; and\n# to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the parks' special qualities by the public.\nThese purposes can conflict: in such cases, under the \"[[Sandford Principle]]\", conservation comes first. This principle was given [[statute|statutory]] force by section 62 of the [[Environment Act 1995]], although there are no explicit provisions as to how wildlife is to be preserved. In pursuing these purposes, national park authorities also have a duty to foster the social and economic well-being of their local communities.\n\nSlightly over half the members of each national park authority are appointees from the principal local authorities covered by the park; the remainder are appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (in England) or the [[Welsh Ministers]] (in Wales), some to represent local [[civil parish|parish]] or [[community (Wales)|community]] councils, others selected to represent the \"national interest\".<ref name=\"natparks\"/> The Broads Authority also has members appointed by [[Natural England]], [[Great Yarmouth]] Port Authority and the [[Environment Agency]]. The national park authorities and the Broads Authority are covered by similar regulatory controls to those applied to local councils.\n\nFunding for national parks is complex, but the full cost of each park authority is funded from central government funds. In the past this was partly paid for by local authorities, and refunded to them from the government to varying degrees. In 2003/2004, the park authorities received around \u00a335.5 million of central government funding.<!-- needs updating -->\n\n[[Natural England]] is the statutory body responsible for designating new national parks in England, subject to approval by the Secretary of State; [[Natural Resources Wales]] designates new national parks in Wales, subject to approval by the Welsh Ministers. The [[Association of National Park Authorities]] exists to provide the park authorities with a single voice when dealing with government and its agencies. The [[Campaign for National Parks]] (formerly Council for National Parks) is a charity that works to protect and enhance the national parks of England and Wales.\n\n==Development and land use planning in national parks==\nNational park authorities are the strategic and local planning authorities for their areas, so that the local district or unitary councils do not exercise planning control in an area covered by a national park. Consequently, they have to perform all the duties of a [[local planning authority]].\n\nThey are responsible for maintaining the [[local development framework]] &mdash; the [[spatial planning]] guide for their area. They also grant planning consent for development, within the constraints of the Framework. This gives them very strong direct control over residential and industrial development, and the design of buildings and other structures; as well as strategic matters such as mineral extraction.\n\nThe national park authorities' planning powers vary only slightly from other authorities, but the policies and their interpretation are stricter than elsewhere. This is supported and encouraged by the government who regard:\n:\"National Park designation as conferring the highest status of protection as far as landscape and scenic beauty are concerned.\" The Countryside &mdash; Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development (1997)<!-- needs full biblio ref -->\n\n==Contribution to the local economy==\nTourism is an important part of the economy of the regions which contain national parks. Through attractions, shops and accommodation, visitors provide an income and a livelihood to local employers and farmers. This income provides jobs for the park. For example, within the Peak District National Park the estimate in 2004 for visitor spending is \u00a3185 million, which supports over 3,400 jobs, representing 27% of total employment in the national park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/tourism.pdf|title=Tourism in the Peak District National Park: fact sheet 2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530101439/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/tourism.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Conflicts in national parks==\nThe national park authorities have two roles: to conserve and enhance the park, and to promote its use by visitors. These two objectives cause frequent conflicts between the needs of different groups of people. It is estimated that the national parks of England and Wales receive 110 million visitors each year. Most of the time it is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by good management. Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the [[Sandford Principle]], the [[Environment Act 1995]] sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks.\n\nAlthough recreation and tourism brings many benefits to an area, it also brings a number of problems. The national funding offered to national park authorities is partly in recognition of the extra difficulties created in dealing with these conflicts.\n; '''Congestion of villages and beauty spots''' : Some of the most popular \"[[honeypot (geography)|honeypot]]\" areas attract large numbers of visitors, resulting in overcrowded [[car park]]s, blocked roads, and overstretched local facilities, particularly on Sundays in the summer and on [[bank holiday]]s. Examples include the areas near [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the Lake District and [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] and [[Bakewell]] in the Peak District. Also [[Betws-y-Coed]] in [[Snowdonia]].\n; '''Erosion''' : [[Hill-walking]] and use of other public [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights-of-way]] is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use of the most popular paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be unsightly. Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by [[Trail riding|horse riding]] on unsurfaced [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s, [[mountain biking]] and use of [[off-road vehicle]]s on [[green lane (road)|green lane]]s. Examples include [[Dovedale]] in the Peak District. [[Over-grazing]], for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.\n; '''Damage and disturbance to wildlife''' : [[Wildlife]] may be disturbed by the level of use on some of the areas of the parks that are open to the public. [[Moorland]] and [[chalk downland]] is easily damaged by regular use, and takes many years to recover. Moorland birds in particular nest and roost on the ground and are therefore especially sensitive. [[Orienteering]], [[mountain biking]] and [[hang gliding]] are typical activities which are likely to cause disturbance to nesting birds.\n; '''Litter''' : Litter of all kinds is both unsightly and can cause pollution and damage to livestock and wild animals. Broken glass is a danger to people and, by [[Focus (optics)|focus]]ing the rays of the sun, a possible cause of fire, particularly in areas of moorland such as [[Exmoor]], parts of the [[Peak District]] and the [[North York Moors]].\n; '''Damage to farmland''' : Trampling of grass [[meadow]]s reduces the amount of winter feed for farm animals. Walkers who stray from footpaths may climb over fences or [[dry stone wall]]s rather than looking out for the [[stile]]s that mark the course of footpaths across farmland. Sheep can be injured or even killed by dogs not under proper control, especially at lambing time.\n; '''Local community displacement''' : Gift shops and [[caf\u00e9]]s which cater for the needs of tourists are often more profitable than shops selling everyday goods for local people (such as butchers or bakers). In some villages where tourist shops are in the majority and there are few shops catering for the local people, the local community may feel pushed out by the tourists. Houses are often very expensive in tourist villages as there is demand for them as [[Vacation property|second homes]] or [[holiday home]]s by [[holiday cottage]] firms or well-off people who live elsewhere, or who move to a local home from which they commute to work, making them unaffordable for local people. This is a particular problem in areas within easy commuting distance of large cities, such as the [[Peak District]], the [[Lake District]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], and the [[New Forest]] and [[South Downs]].\n; '''Conflict between recreational users''' : Some forms of use of national parks interfere with other uses. For example, use of high-speed [[boat]]s causes [[noise pollution]], and conflicts with other uses such as boat trips, yachting, canoeing, and swimming. A controversial [[bylaw]] imposing a 10&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knot]] speed limit came into force on [[Windermere]] on 29 March 2005. The new speed limit for Windermere effectively prohibits [[motorboat|speedboats]] and [[water skiing]] in the Lake District (of the 16 larger lakes in the [[Lake District]], only Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], [[Derwent Water]] and [[Ullswater]] have a public right of [[navigation]]; speed limits were imposed on the three lakes other than Windermere in the 1970s and 1980s).\n\n== List of national parks==\n{{main|List of national parks of England and Wales}}\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | \u2116\n! scope=\"col\" | National park\n! scope=\"col\" | Established<ref>{{Cite news |title=History of the National Parks |url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/history.htm |accessdate=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719195120/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/history.htm |archivedate=19 July 2012 }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | km\u00b2\n! scope=\"col\" | sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n| 1\n| [[Peak District]]\n| {{dts|17 April 1951}}\n| {{convert|1438|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 2\n| [[Lake District National Park|Lake District]]\n| {{dts|9 May 1951}}\n| {{convert|2362|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 3\n| [[Snowdonia National Park|Snowdonia]]<br/>({{lang-cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri|links=no}})\n| {{dts|18 October 1951}}\n| {{convert|2142|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 4\n| [[Dartmoor]]\n| {{dts|30 October 1951}}\n| {{convert|956|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 5\n| [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park|Pembrokeshire Coast]]<br/>({{lang-cy|Arfordir Penfro|links=no}})\n| {{dts|29 February 1952}}\n| {{convert|620|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 6\n| [[North York Moors]]\n| {{dts|28 November 1952}}\n| {{convert|1436|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 7\n| [[Yorkshire Dales National Park|Yorkshire Dales]]\n| {{dts|16 November 1954}}\n| {{convert|2178|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 8\n| [[Exmoor]]\n| {{dts|19 October 1954}}\n| {{convert|693|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 9\n| [[Northumberland National Park|Northumberland]]\n| {{dts|6 April 1956}}\n| {{convert|1049|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 10\n| [[Brecon Beacons National Park|Brecon Beacons]]<br/>({{lang-cy|Bannau Brycheiniog|links=no}})\n| {{dts|17 April 1957}}\n| {{convert|1351|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 11\n| [[The Broads]]\n| {{dts|1 April 1989}}\n| {{convert|303|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 12\n| [[New Forest National Park]]\n| {{dts|1 March 2005}}\n| {{convert|580|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|-\n| 13\n| [[South Downs National Park|South Downs]]\n| {{dts|1 April 2010}}\n| {{convert|1641|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | Established total\n| {{convert|16749|km2|sqmi|disp=table}}\n|}\n| style=\"width:310px;\"| [[File:National Parks in England and Wales.svg|300px|thumb|Thirteen areas are designated as national parks in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; the Broads now have 'equivalent status'.]]\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n|}\n\nUntil 2005, some 9.3% of the area of England and Wales lay within national parks; the addition of South Downs and the New Forest has increased this proportion to 10.7%.

Joseph Homer Parker. Initially it was referred to as \"Young Ladies College\", \"Wichita Ladies College\", and \"Congregational Female College\". It was founded during a boom in college and university creation and it was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older who were \"able to read, write, spell and recite the parts of speech.\" In early 1887, the project's leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and in response, renamed their school '''Fairmount College'''.  Envisioned to be the \"Vassar of the West,\" the streets of the neighboring neighborhoods were named after prominent women's colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. Support came mainly from the Plymouth Congregational Church to build it, but the school never opened its doors. In 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school '''Fairmount Institute'''. It opened in September to men and women, with an emphasis on training in preaching or teaching. It closed because of financial difficulties.\n\nIn 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. Amid growing financial troubles, the college's supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the '''Municipal University of Wichita''' (popularly known as \"Wichita University\" or \"WU\"). It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi, and catered to students of limited means. On July 1, 1964, the school officially entered the state system of higher education as '''Wichita State University''' (WSU).<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=aboutwsu&p=/wsu_history |title=ABOUT WSU \u2013 Wichita State University |website=Webs.wichita.edu |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWSU is one of three research institutions in the state of [[Kansas]], along with [[Kansas State University]] (KSU) and the [[University of Kansas]] (KU).\n\n== Campuses==\n[[File:Looking at Hubbard Hall at Wichita State University in the Afternoon.jpg|thumb|Hubbard Hall]]\n[[File:Personnages Oiseaux (1978).jpg|thumb|[[Ulrich Museum|Edwin A.

Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wichita.edu/my/wushock.asp |title=WuShock: A True Original \u2013 Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas |publisher=Wichita.edu |accessdate=March 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212140230/http://www.wichita.edu/my/wushock.asp# |archive-date=December 12, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Although the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol. WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school. Elsea, who had been a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] during [[World War II]], decided that \"the school needed a mascot who gave a tough impression, with a serious, no-nonsense scowl.\"\n\nOnce Elsea's mascot was adopted by the university, which by that time was known as the Municipal University of Wichita, all that was needed was a name. The October 7, 1948, issue of The Sunflower, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. It was freshman Jack Kersting who suggested the winning name, \"WuShock.\"\n\nIn 1998, WuShock, also referred to as \"Wu,\" marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help. Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/aboutus/about_wushock.asp |title=WuShock: A True Original \u2013 Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas |publisher=Wichita.edu |accessdate=March 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054011/http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/aboutus/about_wushock.asp# |archive-date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Football team plane crash===\n{{main|Wichita State University football team plane crash}}\nOn October 2, 1970, a plane carrying players and staff of the WSU football team took off from a [[Colorado]] airport after refueling and was bound for [[Logan, Utah]] for a game against [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State University]].

Joseph Homer Parker. Initially it was referred to as \"Young Ladies College\", \"Wichita Ladies College\", and \"Congregational Female College\". It was founded during a boom in college and university creation and it was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older who were \"able to read, write, spell and recite the parts of speech.\" In early 1887, the project's leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and in response, renamed their school '''Fairmount College'''.  Envisioned to be the \"Vassar of the West,\" the streets of the neighboring neighborhoods were named after prominent women's colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. Support came mainly from the Plymouth Congregational Church to build it, but the school never opened its doors. In 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school '''Fairmount Institute'''. It opened in September to men and women, with an emphasis on training in preaching or teaching. It closed because of financial difficulties.\n\nIn 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. Amid growing financial troubles, the college's supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the '''Municipal University of Wichita''' (popularly known as \"Wichita University\" or \"WU\"). It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi, and catered to students of limited means. On July 1, 1964, the school officially entered the state system of higher education as '''Wichita State University''' (WSU).<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=aboutwsu&p=/wsu_history |title=ABOUT WSU \u2013 Wichita State University |website=Webs.wichita.edu |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWSU is one of three research institutions in the state of [[Kansas]], along with [[Kansas State University]] (KSU) and the [[University of Kansas]] (KU).\n\n== Campuses==\n[[File:Looking at Hubbard Hall at Wichita State University in the Afternoon.jpg|thumb|Hubbard Hall]]\n[[File:Personnages Oiseaux (1978).jpg|thumb|[[Ulrich Museum|Edwin A.

Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wichita.edu/my/wushock.asp |title=WuShock: A True Original \u2013 Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas |publisher=Wichita.edu |accessdate=March 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212140230/http://www.wichita.edu/my/wushock.asp# |archive-date=December 12, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Although the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol. WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school. Elsea, who had been a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] during [[World War II]], decided that \"the school needed a mascot who gave a tough impression, with a serious, no-nonsense scowl.\"\n\nOnce Elsea's mascot was adopted by the university, which by that time was known as the Municipal University of Wichita, all that was needed was a name. The October 7, 1948, issue of The Sunflower, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. It was freshman Jack Kersting who suggested the winning name, \"WuShock.\"\n\nIn 1998, WuShock, also referred to as \"Wu,\" marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help. Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/aboutus/about_wushock.asp |title=WuShock: A True Original \u2013 Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas |publisher=Wichita.edu |accessdate=March 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054011/http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/aboutus/about_wushock.asp# |archive-date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Football team plane crash===\n{{main|Wichita State University football team plane crash}}\nOn October 2, 1970, a plane carrying players and staff of the WSU football team took off from a [[Colorado]] airport after refueling and was bound for [[Logan, Utah]] for a game against [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State University]].

Barristers in protest of the cuts refused the instructions to act on behalf of the defendants at the reduced fees, so no suitably qualified barristers could be found to represent the defendants. As the defendants would not be able to have a fair trial without suitable representation (in breach of their right to a fair trial under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]) the case could not proceed and was stayed.

Barristers in protest of the cuts refused the instructions to act on behalf of the defendants at the reduced fees, so no suitably qualified barristers could be found to represent the defendants. As the defendants would not be able to have a fair trial without suitable representation (in breach of their right to a fair trial under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]) the case could not proceed and was stayed. An adjournment was found to be unlikely to resolve the case and excessive delay would contradict a further requirement of the ECHR (Article 6(1)) requiring timely handling of prosecution.\n\n===Stays of execution===\nStays of execution have a similar effect in respect of execution of judgments. No step may be taken to enforce a judgment while a stay of execution remains in force.\n\n==United States==\nAccording to the [[legal code]], a stay of proceedings can be issued in a case \"brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration\" when the ruling on the case is pending, can be stayed \"until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration\".<ref name=\"cornell1\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/3- Cornell Law- Title 9, Chapter 1,3]</ref>\n\nFor example, in the [[2010s]], as federal and state judges struck down [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans across the country, many judges stayed the rulings during the appeals process. Although a state's ban was struck down, such as that of [[Louisiana]], the stay prevented implementation of their ruling pending a higher court decision and so prevented same-sex couples from obtaining a [[marriage license]].<ref>http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/09/louisiana_same-sex_marriage_ru.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Continuance]]\n* [[Preliminary injunction]]\n* [[Subpoena ad testificandum]]\n* [[Subpoena duces tecum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stay Of Proceedings}}\n[[Category:Civil procedure]]\n[[Category:Criminal procedure]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_of_proceedings"}

A state of emergency is introduced to \u201celiminate the circumstances that served as the basis for the introduction of a state of emergency, to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of man and citizen, and to protect the constitutional order of the Russian Federation\u201d <ref>Article 2 of the law ''On the state of emergency''</ref>.\n\nA state of emergency is introduced only if there are circumstances that constitute \u201can immediate threat to the life and security of citizens or the constitutional system of the Russian Federation\u201d. Such grounds are divided into two categories:\n\nattempts to violently change the constitutional system of the Russian Federation, armed rebellion, regional conflicts, etc.\nnatural and man-made emergencies, natural disasters, etc.<ref>Art. 3 of the law ''On the state of emergency'' </ref>. A state of emergency is introduced by presidential decree throughout Russia for a period of not more than 30 days or in certain areas for a period of not more than 60 days with the right to extend them by a new presidential decree. When the objectives of the state of emergency are achieved, it is canceled in whole or in part.\n\nThe presidential decree on the introduction of a state of emergency does not require prior coordination with the leadership of the constituent entities of the Federation, but it must be approved by the Federation Council \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, within 72 hours from the date of promulgation of the decree. The decree, not approved by the Federation Council for these 3 days, automatically loses force. A presidential decree to extend a state of emergency requires the same approval by the Federation Council.\n\nMoreover, the decree is subject not only to immediate official publication, but also to immediate publication by radio and television.\n\nThe state of emergency is ensured mainly by the internal affairs bodies and the penal system, federal security agencies, the national guard and rescuers. In exceptional cases, the military may be used to restrict entry, to protect critical infrastructure, to separate the warring parties, to suppress the activities of illegal armed groups and to eliminate emergency situations and save people. At the same time, all troops in the emergency zone are transferred to operational subordination to a single federal agency.\n\n==Permissible Limitations==\nA presidential decree on the imposition of a state of emergency should contain \u201can exhaustive list of temporary restrictions on the rights and freedoms of citizens of the Russian Federation, foreign citizens and stateless persons, the rights of organizations and public associations\u201d.\n\nThe State of Emergency Act provides for three groups of time limits that the president may impose.<ref>[http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_31866/ebb0d572b1c5233c237e04fe0489decb4b818960/ \u0424\u041a\u0417 \"\u041e \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438\" (2001), \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 III]</ref>\n\n*General restrictions:\n\n**Suspension of powers of regional and local authorities and the operation of regional and local laws contrary to the state of emergency decree;\n**Restriction of freedom of movement, entry and exit, traffic, inspection of vehicles;\n**Strengthening the protection of public order and critical infrastructure, stopping hazardous industries;\n**Restriction of economic and financial activities, a special procedure for the turnover of food and basic necessities;\n**Prohibition of mass events and strikes;\n**Evacuation of valuables if there is a real threat of their abduction or damage.\n\n*Restrictions in the event of a riot or coup attempt:\n\n**Curfew, expulsion of nonresident violators of the regime;\n**Censorship;\n**Checking documents, personal items, vehicles and housing;\n**Restriction of the sale of weapons, dangerous substances, drugs, drugs and alcohol, their temporary withdrawal from citizens;\n**Extension of arrest for suspects of particularly serious crimes - for the entire duration of the state of emergency.\n\n*Limitations in the event of natural or man-made disasters:\n\n**Temporary relocation to safe areas;\n**Quarantine;\n**Mobilization of any organizations and their reorientation for emergency needs;\n**Removal of heads of state organizations incapable of providing a state of emergency;\n**Mobilization of residents and their vehicles for rescue operations which at the same time are supposed to pay the labor of mobilized residents, compensation for the used property. \n**The creation of extraordinary courts or expedited proceedings is prohibited, the judicial system and the prosecutor's office are operating in the same form.

A state of emergency is introduced to \u201celiminate the circumstances that served as the basis for the introduction of a state of emergency, to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of man and citizen, and to protect the constitutional order of the Russian Federation\u201d <ref>Article 2 of the law ''On the state of emergency''</ref>.\n\nA state of emergency is introduced only if there are circumstances that constitute \u201can immediate threat to the life and security of citizens or the constitutional system of the Russian Federation\u201d. Such grounds are divided into two categories:\n\nattempts to violently change the constitutional system of the Russian Federation, armed rebellion, regional conflicts, etc.\nnatural and man-made emergencies, natural disasters, etc.<ref>Art. 3 of the law ''On the state of emergency'' </ref>. A state of emergency is introduced by presidential decree throughout Russia for a period of not more than 30 days or in certain areas for a period of not more than 60 days with the right to extend them by a new presidential decree. When the objectives of the state of emergency are achieved, it is canceled in whole or in part.\n\nThe presidential decree on the introduction of a state of emergency does not require prior coordination with the leadership of the constituent entities of the Federation, but it must be approved by the Federation Council \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, within 72 hours from the date of promulgation of the decree. The decree, not approved by the Federation Council for these 3 days, automatically loses force. A presidential decree to extend a state of emergency requires the same approval by the Federation Council.\n\nMoreover, the decree is subject not only to immediate official publication, but also to immediate publication by radio and television.\n\nThe state of emergency is ensured mainly by the internal affairs bodies and the penal system, federal security agencies, the national guard and rescuers. In exceptional cases, the military may be used to restrict entry, to protect critical infrastructure, to separate the warring parties, to suppress the activities of illegal armed groups and to eliminate emergency situations and save people. At the same time, all troops in the emergency zone are transferred to operational subordination to a single federal agency.\n\n==Permissible Limitations==\nA presidential decree on the imposition of a state of emergency should contain \u201can exhaustive list of temporary restrictions on the rights and freedoms of citizens of the Russian Federation, foreign citizens and stateless persons, the rights of organizations and public associations\u201d.\n\nThe State of Emergency Act provides for three groups of time limits that the president may impose.<ref>[http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_31866/ebb0d572b1c5233c237e04fe0489decb4b818960/ \u0424\u041a\u0417 \"\u041e \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438\" (2001), \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 III]</ref>\n\n*General restrictions:\n\n**Suspension of powers of regional and local authorities and the operation of regional and local laws contrary to the state of emergency decree;\n**Restriction of freedom of movement, entry and exit, traffic, inspection of vehicles;\n**Strengthening the protection of public order and critical infrastructure, stopping hazardous industries;\n**Restriction of economic and financial activities, a special procedure for the turnover of food and basic necessities;\n**Prohibition of mass events and strikes;\n**Evacuation of valuables if there is a real threat of their abduction or damage.\n\n*Restrictions in the event of a riot or coup attempt:\n\n**Curfew, expulsion of nonresident violators of the regime;\n**Censorship;\n**Checking documents, personal items, vehicles and housing;\n**Restriction of the sale of weapons, dangerous substances, drugs, drugs and alcohol, their temporary withdrawal from citizens;\n**Extension of arrest for suspects of particularly serious crimes - for the entire duration of the state of emergency.\n\n*Limitations in the event of natural or man-made disasters:\n\n**Temporary relocation to safe areas;\n**Quarantine;\n**Mobilization of any organizations and their reorientation for emergency needs;\n**Removal of heads of state organizations incapable of providing a state of emergency;\n**Mobilization of residents and their vehicles for rescue operations which at the same time are supposed to pay the labor of mobilized residents, compensation for the used property. \n**The creation of extraordinary courts or expedited proceedings is prohibited, the judicial system and the prosecutor's office are operating in the same form. It is forbidden to expand the use of physical force, special means and weapons.\n\n==Order management==\nThe State of Emergency Act provides for three options for managing emergency situations. The first, basic, involves the creation of a commandant\u2019s office.<ref>[http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_31866/801c2346a2a492baf87cf3f0a1151e43eb25088a/ \u0424\u041a\u0417 \"\u041e \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438\" (2001), \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 IV]</ref> The second and third are called \u201cspecial management\u201d and are introduced in particularly difficult conditions.<ref>[http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_31866/60cfa5f0a26eccaa2286366cf09e429eef9cb893/ \u0424\u041a\u0417 \"\u041e \u0447\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438\" (2001), \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 V]</ref>\n\n===Conventional management and commandant's office===\nWhen a state of emergency is introduced, elections and referenda are not held, and the powers of elected authorities, local authorities and officials in the area of emergency are automatically extended. If the regime is introduced throughout the country, the Federation Council and the State Duma continue to work throughout the entire period of its operation.\n\nThe President appoints a commandant in the state of emergency zone who manages law enforcement officers and the military, who provides the state of emergency, determines the procedure for applying the restrictions, or invites the president to introduce additional ones, and also participates in the work of any state or local authorities on his territory. To coordinate the actions of various forces and means, the commandant can create a joint operational headquarters.\n\nThe law provides for the possibility of introducing \u201cspecial management\u201d of the territory in which the state of emergency is declared, after a corresponding warning addressed by the president to the population and officials of state authorities of a constituent entity of the Russian Federation and local authorities operating in such territory.\n\n===Temporary Special Management===\nThe temporary special territorial authority takes over the powers of regional and local authorities, in whole or in part. The head of this body is appointed by the president, and the commandant becomes his first deputy.\n\n===Federal Office===\nThe federal governing body replaces the temporary special body if it has failed in its tasks. The president also appoints its head, and the commandant also becomes his first deputy. At the same time, the federal body fully assumes the powers of regional and local authorities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Martial law in Russia]]\n*[[Russian System of Disaster Management]]\n*[[Emergency medical services in Russia]]\n*[[Main Directorate of Special Programs of the President of the Russian Federation]]\n*[[Federal Agency for State Reserves (Russia)]]\n*[[Freedom of assembly in Russia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Russia topics}}\n\n[[Category:Russian law]]\n[[Category:Politics of Russia]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Emergency management in Russia]]\n[[Category:Government of Russia]]\n[[Category:Inclement weather management]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement]]\n[[Category:Dictatorship]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency_in_Russia"}

Voysey]], Harry Powell, [[Selwyn Image]], [[Henry Holiday]], and [[Christopher Whall]].\n\nThe collections of applied art are complemented by the Brangwyn Gift, comprising paintings, drawings and prints by Morris's former student Sir [[Frank Brangwyn]] as well as works by the Pre-Raphaelites and other Victorian and later artists.\n\n==Redevelopment==\n[[File:William Morris Gallery-002.JPG|thumb|right|Garden side, showing the new extension on the left]]\nIn 2007, the museum faced a closure threat after its opening hours were cut back as a cost-cutting exercise, breaking a stipulation of gifts by Sir Frank Brangwyn, that works should be on view for a minimum amount of time weekly. Campaigners against the cuts included former Culture Secretary [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]].<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/design/story/0,,2000438,00.html Closure threat to Morris Museum], ''[[The Observer]]'', 28 January 2007</ref><ref>''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/01/25/wmorris_feature.shtml The William Morris Gallery dispute]'', [[BBC]], 15 January 2007.

In Autumn 2010 this proposal was successful in securing round-two funding of \u00a31.523 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which was matched with \u00a31.5 million from the London Borough of Waltham Forest. Further funding was secured from charitable trusts and foundations, notably the Friends of the William Morris Gallery, and through an ongoing public fundraising campaign. Redevelopment of the building and collections finally started in 2011 and after just over a year's closure, reopened on 2 August 2012.<ref>[http://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/Pages/News/wmg-reopens.aspx Opening of the refurbished William Morris Gallery] ,London Borough of Waltham Forest website , August 2012</ref> For the first month, [[Grayson Perry]]'s fifteen-metre long [[Walthamstow Tapestry]] was on display.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/9441970/William-Morris-Gallery-re-opening-Lloyd-Park-London-review.html|title=William Morris Gallery re-opening, Lloyd Park, London, review|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe redevelopment of Water House was designed by architects and exhibition designers [[Pringle Richards Sharratt]]. A new wing, designed to sit comfortably next to the early Georgian architecture of William Morris's house, succeeds in doing so by using similar details&nbsp;\u2013 handmade brick with sash windows and gauged brick arches&nbsp;\u2013 in a contrasting red brick. The extension houses a new gallery for temporary exhibitions, toilets and a caf\u00e9 with a balcony overlooking the gardens to the rear. The permanent displays and educational areas were completely rearranged. The project also provides a learning and research centre on the top floor, and offices in the basement. New learning programmes and a dedicated website were developed alongside the physical changes.\n\n==Learning facility==\nThe gallery is also used as a learning facility with educational exhibitions from artists such as [[Eamon Everall]] of the [[Stuckism|stuckist]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/an-introduction-to-portraiture-with-eamon-everall-tickets-34628131674|title=An introduction to Portraiture with Eamon Everall|website=Eventbrite|accessdate=4 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Lloyd Park==\nThe gardens of the house, now known as Lloyd Park, notably include a moat which pre-dates the Georgian house.

The Court Tower will comprise the courtrooms, hearing chambers and court supporting functions, and the Office Tower will house the offices and other support functions.\n\nThe two towers are designed to be eco-friendly and will feature naturally-ventilated corridors and high-rise gardens to provide shade from the afternoon sun. The high-rise sky terraces will bring green relief to the built-up city and provide soothing gardens to the users. The towers will also use renewable energy such as solar power panels.\n\nWhen completed, the State Courts Towers will accommodate over 60 courtrooms and over 50 hearing chambers. Court users can also look forward to improved service counters, designed to better address their needs.\n\nThe design of the new State Courts Towers derived from an open design competition held in September 2011. The project comprises a development of a new tower and retrofitting the existing State Courts Building. Serie Architects and Multiply Architects & Engineers LLP has been awarded the assignment in June 2012, and will work with CPG Corporation to implement the submitted design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=250218380 |title=Winning design for new Subordinate Courts Complex selected |publisher=Channel News Asia |date=2014-06-05 |accessdate=2014-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908202334/http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=250218380 |archive-date=2014-09-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was shortlisted from the 19 proposals submitted.\n\n=== Groundbreaking and Construction ===\nThe State Courts Towers' groundbreaking ceremony took place in May 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/NewsAndEvents/Pages/Media-Release--Groundbreaking-Ceremony-for-New-State-Courts-Complex-on-28-May-2014.aspx|title=MEDIA RELEASE: GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY FOR NEW STATE COURTS COMPLEX ON 28 MAY 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Piling works and service diversions began in June that same year. \n\nThe contract for the construction of the State Courts Towers has been awarded to Samsung C&T Corporation in early 2016.
