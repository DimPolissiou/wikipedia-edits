Dramacydal first appeared on the B-side of Tupac Shakur's 1993 single \"[[Holler If Ya Hear Me]]\", on the track \"Flex\". Dramacydal was composed of K-Dog ([[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]]), Young Hollywood ([[Yaki Kadafi]]), Mutah or Mu ([[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]]), and Big Malcolm ([[E.D.I. Mean]]). They also appeared on 2Pac's ''[[Me Against The World]]'' and ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' albums. They were also known as \"Thoro Headz\" and \"Young Thugz\".\n\nWhen 2Pac signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] upon his release from prison, he recruited his stepbrother, [[Mopreme Shakur]], and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Kadafi (Outlawz)|Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added. Together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's multi-platinum smash hit album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. They later dropped the title of \"Immortalz\" after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi. Subsequently, some of the members of Thug Life, not joined by the others, moved on as the \"Outlawz\".\n\nWhen Tupac Shakur recorded \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", a [[Diss Track|diss track]] beamed towards his former friend and rival [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Puff Daddy]], and [[Lil' Kim]], he recruited three members from the group he had previously worked with, eager to work with them again. Together with New Jersey rappers and other associates they formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release, ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]],'' that carried 2Pac's new stage name, Makaveli. It was on this Makaveli album that Outlawz, appearing on a few songs, first came to the greater rap community's notice.\n\nThe idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various leaders who resisted control by the new world order, past and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name, \"Operating Under Thug Laws As Warriorz\", although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\n===Original members===\n'''There were 10 original members of the Outlawz, including Makaveli:'''\n*'''[[Tupac Shakur|Makaveli]]''' (Tupac Shakur),  also known as '''2pac''', was the leader of the group; he gave himself the name of Makaveli after the Italian political philosopher [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose writings inspired Shakur in prison. Shakur was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|fatally injured in a drive-by shooting on September 7, 1996]] in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n*'''[[Yaki Kadafi]]''' (Yafeu Fula), also known as '''Young Hollywood''', '''Yak'''  and '''Killa Kadafi''', was given the name Yaki Kadafi after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].

Dramacydal first appeared on the B-side of Tupac Shakur's 1993 single \"[[Holler If Ya Hear Me]]\", on the track \"Flex\". Dramacydal was composed of K-Dog ([[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]]), Young Hollywood ([[Yaki Kadafi]]), Mutah or Mu ([[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]]), and Big Malcolm ([[E.D.I. Mean]]). They also appeared on 2Pac's ''[[Me Against The World]]'' and ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' albums. They were also known as \"Thoro Headz\" and \"Young Thugz\".\n\nWhen 2Pac signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] upon his release from prison, he recruited his stepbrother, [[Mopreme Shakur]], and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Kadafi (Outlawz)|Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added. Together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's multi-platinum smash hit album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. They later dropped the title of \"Immortalz\" after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi. Subsequently, some of the members of Thug Life, not joined by the others, moved on as the \"Outlawz\".\n\nWhen Tupac Shakur recorded \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", a [[Diss Track|diss track]] beamed towards his former friend and rival [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Puff Daddy]], and [[Lil' Kim]], he recruited three members from the group he had previously worked with, eager to work with them again. Together with New Jersey rappers and other associates they formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release, ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]],'' that carried 2Pac's new stage name, Makaveli. It was on this Makaveli album that Outlawz, appearing on a few songs, first came to the greater rap community's notice.\n\nThe idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various leaders who resisted control by the new world order, past and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name, \"Operating Under Thug Laws As Warriorz\", although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\n===Original members===\n'''There were 10 original members of the Outlawz, including Makaveli:'''\n*'''[[Tupac Shakur|Makaveli]]''' (Tupac Shakur),  also known as '''2pac''', was the leader of the group; he gave himself the name of Makaveli after the Italian political philosopher [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose writings inspired Shakur in prison. Shakur was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|fatally injured in a drive-by shooting on September 7, 1996]] in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n*'''[[Yaki Kadafi]]''' (Yafeu Fula), also known as '''Young Hollywood''', '''Yak'''  and '''Killa Kadafi''', was given the name Yaki Kadafi after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].
