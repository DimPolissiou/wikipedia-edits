The Cessna impacted on Polk Ave. between 32nd St. and Iowa St., killing the two on board. Nine others on the ground were injured and 22 homes were destroyed or damaged by the impact and debris.\n\n==Accident==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}<!--very few citations; assuming most of this info comes from the NTSB report, but still needs footnotes-->\nPacific Southwest Airlines had begun operations in 1949 and was one of the first \"budget\" airlines in the US. By the 1970s, it operated with the slogan \"The World's Friendliest Airline\" and was known for its colorfully painted aircraft, flight attendants dressed in miniskirts and high heels, and humorous broadcasts by the crew over the PA system. The airline also prided itself on its safety record; in 1978 it was entering its 29th year in business without a fatal accident. In 1969, there had been an ominous incident when a different PSA 727 collided with a Cessna 182L while taking off from San Francisco. The Cessna was forced to land, but no significant damage occurred to the 727 and it proceeded on its flight to Ontario.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19690115-1</ref>\n\nOn the morning of September 25, 1978, [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] Flight 182 departed [[Sacramento]] for San Diego via Los Angeles. The seven-person, San Diego-based crew consisted of Captain James E. McFeron (42); First Officer Robert E. Fox (38); Flight Engineer Martin J. Wahne (44); and four flight attendants. The flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles was uneventful. At 8:34&nbsp;a.m., Flight 182 departed Los Angeles. First Officer Fox was the pilot flying. There were 128 passengers on board including 29 PSA employees. The weather in San Diego that morning was sunny and clear with {{convert|10|mi|km}} of visibility.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />{{rp|2}}\n\nAt 8:59&nbsp;a.m., the PSA crew was alerted by the approach controller about a small Cessna 172 Skyhawk aircraft nearby. The Cessna was being flown by two licensed pilots. One was Martin Kazy Jr., 32, who possessed single-engine, multiengine, and [[Instrument Rating in the United States|instrument flight]] ratings, as well as a [[Pilot certification in the United States|commercial certificate]] and an instrument [[flight instructor]] certificate. He had flown a total of 5,137 hours. The other, David Boswell, 35, a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] Sergeant, possessed single-engine and multiengine ratings and a commercial certificate. He had flown 407 hours at the time of the accident, and was practicing [[instrument landing system]] approaches under the instruction of Kazy in pursuit of his instrument rating. They had departed from [[Montgomery Field]] and were navigating under [[visual flight rules]], which did not require the filing of a flight plan. Boswell was wearing a \"hood\" to limit his field of vision straight ahead to the cockpit panel, much like an oversized sun visor with vertical panels to block peripheral vision, which is normal in IFR training. At the time of the collision, the Cessna was on the missed approach (in visual meteorological conditions) from Lindbergh's Runway 9, heading east and climbing. The Cessna was in communication with San Diego approach control.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />{{rp|2}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|'''Abridged communication between PSA 182 and the controllers, and among the PSA flight crew'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|# = Nonpertinent word; * = Unintelligible word; () = Questionable text; (()) = Commentary; Shading = Radio communication \n|-\n!

The PSA plane was descending and rapidly closing in on the small plane, which had taken a right turn to the east, deviating from the assigned course. According to the report issued by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB), the Cessna may have been a difficult visual target for the jet's pilots, as it was below them and blended in with the multicolored houses of the residential area beneath; the Cessna's [[fuselage]] was yellow, and most of the houses were a yellowish color. Also, the apparent motion of the Cessna as viewed from the Boeing was minimized, as both planes were on approximately the same course. The report said that another possible reason that the PSA aircrew had difficulty observing the Cessna was that its fuselage was made visually smaller due to [[Foreshortening#Foreshortening|foreshortening]]. However, the same report in another section also stated that \"the white surface of the Cessna's wing could have presented a relatively bright target in the morning sunlight.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />\n\nA visibility study cited in the NTSB report concluded that the Cessna should have been almost centered in the windshield of the Boeing from 170 to 90 seconds before the collision, and thereafter it was probably positioned on the lower portion of the windshield just above the windshield wipers. The study also said that the Cessna pilot would have had about a 10-second view of the Boeing from the left-door window about 90 seconds before the collision, but visibility of the overtaking jet was blocked by the Cessna's ceiling structure for the remainder of the time.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />\n\nFlight 182's crew never explicitly alerted the tower that they had lost sight of the Cessna. If they had made this clear to controllers, the crash might not have happened. Also, if the Cessna had maintained the heading of 70\u00b0 assigned to it by ATC instead of turning to 90\u00b0, the NTSB estimates the planes would have missed each other by about {{cvt|1000|ft|m}} instead of colliding.

It then impacted the driveway of the house at a {{cvt|260|knots|mph km/h}}, nose-down attitude while banked 50\u00b0 to the right. [[Seismograph]]ic readings indicated that the impact occurred at 09:02:07, about 2.5 seconds after the [[cockpit voice recorder]] lost power. The plane crashed just west of the I-805 freeway, around {{convert|30|ft|m}} north of the intersection of Dwight and Nile Streets, with the bulk of the debris field spreading in a northeast to southwesterly direction towards Boundary Street.

According to an NTSB investigator, \"[The NTSB] estimated that that the 727 was going a little under {{convert|400|mph|knots km/h}} when it impacted that garage floor. This created a pressure wave that traveled back through the passenger cabin ripping open the top right side of the passenger cabin like it was a bag of chips and then expelling everything out of that passenger cabin through the rip at over {{convert|200|mph|knots km/h}}. This had an effect like a paper shredder. Of all the people that were aboard this flight only three bodies were recovered completely intact. Solace can be taken in the fact that it is very highly unlikely that anyone in the passenger cabin survived the initial pressure wave when it hit them. Their death while a horrible thought was very very quick and everyone was already dead before their bodies were ejected from the plane and dismembered. The reports of body parts in trees and bushes are correct and were not exaggerated. Veteran news reporters that had thought they had seen it all in their careers could be seen throwing up in the gutters along with some police officers. An aircraft crash site is never pretty and is something you won't soon forget if you have the unfortunate luck of witnessing one but this one goes down as probably the worst of the worst. The NTSB ended up having to send their investigators of this crash to psychiatrists after they concluded their investigation and I had read that the S.D. police and fire departments offered the same thing to their personnel that responded to this crash site.\"\n\nThe only intact bodies belonged to two flight attendants, First Officer Fox, and one passenger.

Flight 182's crew lost sight of the Cessna in contravention of ATC instructions to \"keep visual separation from that traffic\", and did not alert ATC that they had lost sight of it. Errors on the part of ATC were also named as contributing factors, including the use of visual separation procedures when radar clearances were available. Additionally, the Cessna pilots, for reasons unknown, did not maintain their assigned east-northeasterly [[Air navigation|heading]] of 070\u00b0 after completing a practice instrument approach, nor did they notify ATC of their course change. Concerning this, the NTSB report states, \"According to the testimony of the controllers and the assistant chief flight instructor of the Gibbs Flite Center (owner of the Cessna), the 08:59:56 transmission from approach control to the Cessna only imposed an altitude limitation on the pilot, he was not required to maintain the 070\u00b0 heading. However, the assistant chief flight instructor testified that he would expect the [Cessna] pilot to fly the assigned heading or inform the controller that he was not able to do so.\"\n\nA dissenting opinion in the original (''more at bottom of paragraph'') NTSB crash report by member [[Francis H. McAdams]] strongly questioned why the unauthorized change in course by the Cessna was not specifically cited as a \"contributing factor\" in the final report; instead, it was listed as simply a \"finding,\" which carries less weight. McAdams also \"sharply disagreed\" with the majority of the panel on other issues, giving more weight to inadequate ATC procedures as another \"probable cause\" to the accident, rather than merely treating them as a contributing factor. McAdams also added the \"possible misidentification of the Cessna by the PSA aircrew due to the presence of a third unknown aircraft in the area\" as a contributing factor. The majority panel members did not cite this as a credible possibility. In an August 1982 amendment to the probable-cause finding, the NTSB adopted McAdams\u2019 viewpoints regarding both ATC and pilot failings.<ref name=FAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf |title=FAA Historical Chronology, 1926-1996 |page=203 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]}}</ref>\n\nThe report states that in the PSA cockpit, some conversation in the cockpit was not relevant to the flight during critical phases of the flight. The report states that the conversation was not a causal factor in the accident, but that \"it does point out the dangers inherent in this type of cockpit environment during descent and approach to landing.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\"/>{{rp|33}}\n\nThe two photographs of Flight 182 taken by Hans Wendt revealed that the left wing flaps were extended as the crew tried hopelessly to steer the crippled aircraft and that the right wing had a large piece missing where the Cessna had struck. Although it was obvious that the flaps were damaged or destroyed from the collision, NTSB investigators could not determine the condition of the hydraulic system in the wing and whether the plumbing inside it had actually been ruptured or merely flattened. Since the right wing was extremely fragmented, examination of debris provided no useful information. It was thought{{who|date=February 2017}} that the crew may have tried to guide the 727 away from impacting a residential area and onto Route 805 where damage would be lessened,{{failed verification|date=February 2017}} but could not do so, and the final conclusion of the NTSB was that even if the hydraulic lines in the right wing were undamaged, the missing flaps and spreading fire would have adversely affected the plane's aerodynamic profile and in all likelihood, Flight 182 was completely uncontrollable after the collision.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\"/>{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the aftermath of the devastation on the ground, a controversy was renewed in San Diego over the placement of such a busy airport in a heavily populated area. Despite proposals to relocate it, [[San Diego International Airport]], the busiest single-runway commercial airport in the U.S., remains in use.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080327052308/http://www.san.org/airport/airport_facts/index.asp Facts about San Diego International Airport] by [http://www.san.org/sdcraa/ San Diego County Regional Airport Authority] hosted by [[Internet Archive]]</ref> The crash site was cordoned off by police and remained so for an entire year.\n\nAt the time, PSA Flight 182 was the U.S.'s deadliest commercial air disaster, surpassed eight months later on Friday, May 25, 1979, when [[American Airlines Flight 191]] (a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]) crashed in Chicago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19790525-2|title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 N110AA Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, IL (ORD)|last=Ranter|first=Harro|website=aviation-safety.net|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the crash, the NTSB recommended the immediate implementation of a [[Terminal Radar Service Area]] around Lindbergh Field to provide for the separation of aircraft, as well as an immediate review of control procedures for all busy terminal areas. This initial rule did not include small, general-aviation aircraft. Therefore, on May 15, 1980, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), implemented what is called [[Airspace class (United States)|Class B airspace]] to provide for the separation of all aircraft operating in the area. Additionally, all aircraft, regardless of size, are required to operate under \"positive radar control\", a rule that allows only radar control from the ground for all aircraft operating in the airport's airspace.<ref name=Lessons />\n\nAt the time of the crash, Lindbergh Field was the only airport in San Diego County with an instrument landing system. Since the Cessna pilot was practicing instrument landings, the FAA quickly installed the system at [[Montgomery Field]] and [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]], as well as a localizer approach to [[Gillespie Field]], to allow pilots to practice at smaller airports.<ref name=Lessons />\n\nAs a result of this and other midair collisions<ref>{{cite news |title=United Airlines Tests Anti-Collision Device With Initial Success |work=The Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660 |publisher=Dow Jones & Company Inc |date=November 19, 1987}}</ref> (including [[Aerom\u00e9xico Flight 498|an almost identical one]] in 1986) the \"[[Traffic Collision Avoidance System|Traffic Collision Alert and Avoidance System]]\" (TCAS) is now installed in all commercial passenger aircraft and in most commercial cargo airplanes. TCAS gives the pilots visual and audible warnings in the cockpit when two aircraft are approaching each other, and directs pilots to either climb or descend to avoid the other aircraft. However, the system only works if at least one aircraft is equipped with TCAS and the other with a transponder.  After the 1986 Cerritos collision, all flights in Class B were required to have a Mode C transponder.  The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] does not require TCAS on the type of small, single-engined planes that were involved in the PSA disaster or the one involving AeroMexico. Only aircraft certified to carry 19 or more passengers or have a [[maximum takeoff weight]] of more than {{cvt|12600|lb|kg}} are affected by the TCAS rule.\n\nBecause the PSA 182/Cessna collision was the result of pilot error, it is used as a teaching aid in modern flight training. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University uses the crash in \"human factors\" classes,<ref name=Lessons /> with others refer to it while teaching airspace or visual separation rules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe midair collision contributed to Lindbergh Field being ranked 10th among the world's Most Extreme Airports  in a two-hour documentary of the same name released in July 2010, which aired in the U.S. on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:psa182plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque honoring crash victims]]\nA memorial plaque honoring those who died on both planes and on the ground is located in the [[San Diego Aerospace Museum]], near the Theodore Gildred Flight Rotunda in San Diego's [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]].

The library is not in the immediate vicinity of the actual crash site; it has been completely rebuilt and bears no visible evidence of the crash.\n\nOn September 25, 2008, over 100 relatives and friends of the victims of PSA 182 gathered at Dwight and Nile Streets in North Park for a 30th-anniversary memorial of the crash.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080925-0942-bn25psa.html PSA crash victims remembered at morning service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504084759/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080925-0942-bn25psa.html |date=May 4, 2009 }} by Jeff McDonald at [http://www.signonsandiego.com/ SignOnSanDiego.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616051432/http://www.signonsandiego.com/ |date=June 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Depictions in media==\nThe ATC recording of the accident, as well as footage of the aftermath, was included in the [[mondo film]] ''[[Faces of Death]]'', released two weeks after the crash.\n\nThe accident was covered in season 11 of the documentary TV series [[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|''Mayday'']] in an episode titled ''Blind Spot''.

Flight 182 impacted just north of the intersection of Dwight and Nile, killing all 135 people aboard the aircraft and seven people on the ground in houses, including two children. The Cessna impacted on Polk Ave. between 32nd St. and Iowa St., killing the two on board.

By the 1970s, it operated with the slogan \"The World's Friendliest Airline\" and was known for its colorfully painted aircraft, flight attendants dressed in miniskirts and high heels, and humorous broadcasts by the crew over the PA system. The airline also prided itself on its safety record; in 1978 it was entering its 29th year in business without a fatal accident. In 1969, there had been an ominous incident when a different PSA 727 collided with a Cessna 182L while taking off from San Francisco. The Cessna was forced to land, but no significant damage occurred to the 727 and it proceeded on its flight to Ontario.<ref>https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19690115-1</ref>\n\nOn the morning of September 25, 1978, [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] Flight 182 departed [[Sacramento]] for San Diego via Los Angeles. The seven-person, San Diego-based crew consisted of Captain James E. McFeron (42); First Officer Robert E. Fox (38); Flight Engineer Martin J. Wahne (44); and four flight attendants. The flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles was uneventful. At 8:34&nbsp;a.m., Flight 182 departed Los Angeles. First Officer Fox was the pilot flying. There were 128 passengers on board including 29 PSA employees. The weather in San Diego that morning was sunny and clear with {{convert|10|mi|km}} of visibility.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />{{rp|2}}\n\nAt 8:59&nbsp;a.m., the PSA crew was alerted by the approach controller about a small Cessna 172 Skyhawk aircraft nearby. The Cessna was being flown by two licensed pilots. One was Martin Kazy Jr., 32, who possessed single-engine, multiengine, and [[Instrument Rating in the United States|instrument flight]] ratings, as well as a [[Pilot certification in the United States|commercial certificate]] and an instrument [[flight instructor]] certificate. He had flown a total of 5,137 hours. The other, David Boswell, 35, a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] Sergeant, possessed single-engine and multiengine ratings and a commercial certificate. He had flown 407 hours at the time of the accident, and was practicing [[instrument landing system]] approaches under the instruction of Kazy in pursuit of his instrument rating. They had departed from [[Montgomery Field]] and were navigating under [[visual flight rules]], which did not require the filing of a flight plan. Boswell was wearing a \"hood\" to limit his field of vision straight ahead to the cockpit panel, much like an oversized sun visor with vertical panels to block peripheral vision, which is normal in IFR training. At the time of the collision, the Cessna was on the missed approach (in visual meteorological conditions) from Lindbergh's Runway 9, heading east and climbing. The Cessna was in communication with San Diego approach control.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />{{rp|2}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|'''Abridged communication between PSA 182 and the controllers, and among the PSA flight crew'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|# = Nonpertinent word; * = Unintelligible word; () = Questionable text; (()) = Commentary; Shading = Radio communication \n|-\n!

Due to radio static, Lindbergh tower (as per the tower voice recording) received the 09.00:50 transmission as \"He's pass''ing'' off to our right\" and assumed the PSA jet had the Cessna in sight, thus maintaining visual separation.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />{{rp|3}}<ref name=Mayday>{{Cite episode |title=[[List of Mayday episodes#ep80|Blind Spot\"]] |series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]] |publisher=[[Cineflix]] |network=[[Discovery (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]]<!--- country of origin: other networks and series titles found at the linked articles ---> |season=11 |number=8 |date=2012-01-27}}</ref>\n\nAfter getting permission to land, and about 40 seconds before colliding with the Cessna, the conversation among the four occupants of the cockpit (Captain, First Officer, Flight Engineer, and the off-duty PSA Captain, Spencer Nelson, who was riding in the cockpit's jump seat) was, as follows, showing the confusion:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|# = Nonpertinent word * = Unintelligible word () = Questionable text (()) = Commentary\n|-\n!

The PSA plane was descending and rapidly closing in on the small plane, which had taken a right turn to the east, deviating from the assigned course. According to the report issued by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB), the Cessna may have been a difficult visual target for the jet's pilots, as it was below them and blended in with the multicolored houses of the residential area beneath; the Cessna's [[fuselage]] was yellow, and most of the houses were a yellowish color. Also, the apparent motion of the Cessna as viewed from the Boeing was minimized, as both planes were on approximately the same course. The report said that another possible reason that the PSA aircrew had difficulty observing the Cessna was that its fuselage was made visually smaller due to [[Foreshortening#Foreshortening|foreshortening]]. However, the same report in another section also stated that \"the white surface of the Cessna's wing could have presented a relatively bright target in the morning sunlight.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />\n\nA visibility study cited in the NTSB report concluded that the Cessna should have been almost centered in the windshield of the Boeing from 170 to 90 seconds before the collision, and thereafter it was probably positioned on the lower portion of the windshield just above the windshield wipers. The study also said that the Cessna pilot would have had about a 10-second view of the Boeing from the left-door window about 90 seconds before the collision, but visibility of the overtaking jet was blocked by the Cessna's ceiling structure for the remainder of the time.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />\n\nFlight 182's crew never explicitly alerted the tower that they had lost sight of the Cessna. If they had made this clear to controllers, the crash might not have happened. Also, if the Cessna had maintained the heading of 70\u00b0 assigned to it by ATC instead of turning to 90\u00b0, the NTSB estimates the planes would have missed each other by about {{cvt|1000|ft|m}} instead of colliding. Ultimately, the NTSB maintained that, regardless of that change in course, it was the responsibility of the crew in the overtaking jet to comply with the regulatory requirement to pass \"well clear\" of the Cessna.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />\n\n[[Approach Control]] on the ground picked up an automated conflict alert 19 seconds before the collision but did not relay this information to the aircraft because, according to the approach coordinator, such alerts were commonplace even when no actual conflict existed. The NTSB stated: \"Based on all information available to him, he decided that the crew of Flight 182 were complying with their visual separation clearance; that they were accomplishing an overtake maneuver within the separation parameters of the conflict alert computer; and that, therefore, no conflict existed.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\" />\n\nThis was the conversation in the PSA cockpit starting 16 seconds before collision with the Cessna:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"|# = Nonpertinent word * = Unintelligible word () = Questionable text (()) = Commentary\n|-\n!

It then impacted the driveway of the house at a {{cvt|260|knots|mph km/h}}, nose-down attitude while banked 50\u00b0 to the right. [[Seismograph]]ic readings indicated that the impact occurred at 09:02:07, about 2.5 seconds after the [[cockpit voice recorder]] lost power. The plane crashed just west of the I-805 freeway, around {{convert|30|ft|m}} north of the intersection of Dwight and Nile Streets, with the bulk of the debris field spreading in a northeast to southwesterly direction towards Boundary Street.

The explosion and fire from the 727 crashing created a mushroom cloud that could be seen for miles (and was photographed and filmed), About 60% of the entire San Diego Fire Department was ultimately dispatched to the scene, and first responders said nothing resembling an airplane was anywhere to be seen, since the impact, explosion, and fires had completely destroyed the 727 with no sizable components remaining except the engines, empennage, and landing gear.<ref name=ThisIsIt>{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/August-1998/This-is-It/ |title=This Is It! |last=Shess |first=Thomas |publisher=San Diego Magazine |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=December 31, 2017}}</ref> However, the impact and debris area was relatively small due to the plane's steep, nose-down angle.\n\nThe compression and G-forces resulting from the approximately {{convert|350|knots|mph km/h}} impact speed resulted in a scene of incredible carnage as the passengers and crew were mutilated and dismembered. According to an NTSB investigator, \"[The NTSB] estimated that that the 727 was going a little under {{convert|400|mph|knots km/h}} when it impacted that garage floor. This created a pressure wave that traveled back through the passenger cabin ripping open the top right side of the passenger cabin like it was a bag of chips and then expelling everything out of that passenger cabin through the rip at over {{convert|200|mph|knots km/h}}. This had an effect like a paper shredder. Of all the people that were aboard this flight only three bodies were recovered completely intact. Solace can be taken in the fact that it is very highly unlikely that anyone in the passenger cabin survived the initial pressure wave when it hit them. Their death while a horrible thought was very very quick and everyone was already dead before their bodies were ejected from the plane and dismembered. The reports of body parts in trees and bushes are correct and were not exaggerated. Veteran news reporters that had thought they had seen it all in their careers could be seen throwing up in the gutters along with some police officers. An aircraft crash site is never pretty and is something you won't soon forget if you have the unfortunate luck of witnessing one but this one goes down as probably the worst of the worst.

With 144 deaths, it was the deadliest accident to occur in the United States, surpassing the [[1960 New York mid-air collision]], until eight months later when [[American Airlines Flight 191]] crashed with 273 deaths.\n\n==Investigation==\nAt the nearby [[St. Augustine High School (San Diego, California)|St. Augustine High School]], a triage and command and control center was established, with its gymnasium being used as a makeshift morgue and for forensic investigation.\n<ref>[http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070525/news_lz1e25luibel.html The St. Augustine High School Gym Morgue] by Sarah Luibel at [http://www.signonsandiego.com/ SignOnSanDiego.com]</ref> {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Freezer units were used to preserve the biological remains, as San Diego was in the middle of a severe heat wave, with temperatures exceeding 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board report number NTSB/AAR-79-05,<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\"/> released April 19, 1979, determined that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the PSA flight crew to follow proper [[air traffic control]] (ATC) procedures. Flight 182's crew lost sight of the Cessna in contravention of ATC instructions to \"keep visual separation from that traffic\", and did not alert ATC that they had lost sight of it. Errors on the part of ATC were also named as contributing factors, including the use of visual separation procedures when radar clearances were available. Additionally, the Cessna pilots, for reasons unknown, did not maintain their assigned east-northeasterly [[Air navigation|heading]] of 070\u00b0 after completing a practice instrument approach, nor did they notify ATC of their course change. Concerning this, the NTSB report states, \"According to the testimony of the controllers and the assistant chief flight instructor of the Gibbs Flite Center (owner of the Cessna), the 08:59:56 transmission from approach control to the Cessna only imposed an altitude limitation on the pilot, he was not required to maintain the 070\u00b0 heading. However, the assistant chief flight instructor testified that he would expect the [Cessna] pilot to fly the assigned heading or inform the controller that he was not able to do so.\"\n\nA dissenting opinion in the original (''more at bottom of paragraph'') NTSB crash report by member [[Francis H. McAdams]] strongly questioned why the unauthorized change in course by the Cessna was not specifically cited as a \"contributing factor\" in the final report; instead, it was listed as simply a \"finding,\" which carries less weight. McAdams also \"sharply disagreed\" with the majority of the panel on other issues, giving more weight to inadequate ATC procedures as another \"probable cause\" to the accident, rather than merely treating them as a contributing factor. McAdams also added the \"possible misidentification of the Cessna by the PSA aircrew due to the presence of a third unknown aircraft in the area\" as a contributing factor. The majority panel members did not cite this as a credible possibility. In an August 1982 amendment to the probable-cause finding, the NTSB adopted McAdams\u2019 viewpoints regarding both ATC and pilot failings.<ref name=FAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf |title=FAA Historical Chronology, 1926-1996 |page=203 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]}}</ref>\n\nThe report states that in the PSA cockpit, some conversation in the cockpit was not relevant to the flight during critical phases of the flight. The report states that the conversation was not a causal factor in the accident, but that \"it does point out the dangers inherent in this type of cockpit environment during descent and approach to landing.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\"/>{{rp|33}}\n\nThe two photographs of Flight 182 taken by Hans Wendt revealed that the left wing flaps were extended as the crew tried hopelessly to steer the crippled aircraft and that the right wing had a large piece missing where the Cessna had struck. Although it was obvious that the flaps were damaged or destroyed from the collision, NTSB investigators could not determine the condition of the hydraulic system in the wing and whether the plumbing inside it had actually been ruptured or merely flattened. Since the right wing was extremely fragmented, examination of debris provided no useful information. It was thought{{who|date=February 2017}} that the crew may have tried to guide the 727 away from impacting a residential area and onto Route 805 where damage would be lessened,{{failed verification|date=February 2017}} but could not do so, and the final conclusion of the NTSB was that even if the hydraulic lines in the right wing were undamaged, the missing flaps and spreading fire would have adversely affected the plane's aerodynamic profile and in all likelihood, Flight 182 was completely uncontrollable after the collision.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-05 Final Report\"/>{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the aftermath of the devastation on the ground, a controversy was renewed in San Diego over the placement of such a busy airport in a heavily populated area. Despite proposals to relocate it, [[San Diego International Airport]], the busiest single-runway commercial airport in the U.S., remains in use.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080327052308/http://www.san.org/airport/airport_facts/index.asp Facts about San Diego International Airport] by [http://www.san.org/sdcraa/ San Diego County Regional Airport Authority] hosted by [[Internet Archive]]</ref> The crash site was cordoned off by police and remained so for an entire year.\n\nAt the time, PSA Flight 182 was the U.S.'s deadliest commercial air disaster, surpassed eight months later on Friday, May 25, 1979, when [[American Airlines Flight 191]] (a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]) crashed in Chicago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19790525-2|title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 N110AA Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, IL (ORD)|last=Ranter|first=Harro|website=aviation-safety.net|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the crash, the NTSB recommended the immediate implementation of a [[Terminal Radar Service Area]] around Lindbergh Field to provide for the separation of aircraft, as well as an immediate review of control procedures for all busy terminal areas. This initial rule did not include small, general-aviation aircraft. Therefore, on May 15, 1980, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), implemented what is called [[Airspace class (United States)|Class B airspace]] to provide for the separation of all aircraft operating in the area. Additionally, all aircraft, regardless of size, are required to operate under \"positive radar control\", a rule that allows only radar control from the ground for all aircraft operating in the airport's airspace.<ref name=Lessons />\n\nAt the time of the crash, Lindbergh Field was the only airport in San Diego County with an instrument landing system. Since the Cessna pilot was practicing instrument landings, the FAA quickly installed the system at [[Montgomery Field]] and [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]], as well as a localizer approach to [[Gillespie Field]], to allow pilots to practice at smaller airports.<ref name=Lessons />\n\nAs a result of this and other midair collisions<ref>{{cite news |title=United Airlines Tests Anti-Collision Device With Initial Success |work=The Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660 |publisher=Dow Jones & Company Inc |date=November 19, 1987}}</ref> (including [[Aerom\u00e9xico Flight 498|an almost identical one]] in 1986) the \"[[Traffic Collision Avoidance System|Traffic Collision Alert and Avoidance System]]\" (TCAS) is now installed in all commercial passenger aircraft and in most commercial cargo airplanes. TCAS gives the pilots visual and audible warnings in the cockpit when two aircraft are approaching each other, and directs pilots to either climb or descend to avoid the other aircraft. However, the system only works if at least one aircraft is equipped with TCAS and the other with a transponder.  After the 1986 Cerritos collision, all flights in Class B were required to have a Mode C transponder.  The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] does not require TCAS on the type of small, single-engined planes that were involved in the PSA disaster or the one involving AeroMexico. Only aircraft certified to carry 19 or more passengers or have a [[maximum takeoff weight]] of more than {{cvt|12600|lb|kg}} are affected by the TCAS rule.\n\nBecause the PSA 182/Cessna collision was the result of pilot error, it is used as a teaching aid in modern flight training. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University uses the crash in \"human factors\" classes,<ref name=Lessons /> with others refer to it while teaching airspace or visual separation rules.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe midair collision contributed to Lindbergh Field being ranked 10th among the world's Most Extreme Airports  in a two-hour documentary of the same name released in July 2010, which aired in the U.S. on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:psa182plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque honoring crash victims]]\nA memorial plaque honoring those who died on both planes and on the ground is located in the [[San Diego Aerospace Museum]], near the Theodore Gildred Flight Rotunda in San Diego's [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]].

The library is not in the immediate vicinity of the actual crash site; it has been completely rebuilt and bears no visible evidence of the crash.\n\nOn September 25, 2008, over 100 relatives and friends of the victims of PSA 182 gathered at Dwight and Nile Streets in North Park for a 30th-anniversary memorial of the crash.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080925-0942-bn25psa.html PSA crash victims remembered at morning service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504084759/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080925-0942-bn25psa.html |date=May 4, 2009 }} by Jeff McDonald at [http://www.signonsandiego.com/ SignOnSanDiego.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616051432/http://www.signonsandiego.com/ |date=June 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Depictions in media==\nThe ATC recording of the accident, as well as footage of the aftermath, was included in the [[mondo film]] ''[[Faces of Death]]'', released two weeks after the crash.\n\nThe accident was covered in season 11 of the documentary TV series [[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|''Mayday'']] in an episode titled ''Blind Spot''.

In conclusion, Hannley continued to assert that Ubisoft should focus more on providing more immediate access to recent music rather than requiring players to wait for the next annual physical release, but that ''Just Dance 2017'' was \"thankfully a marked improvement over its predecessor.\"<ref name=\"hg-review\">{{cite web|title=Review: Just Dance 2017|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/11/01/review-just-dance-2017/233369/|website=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe game won the award for \"Favorite Video Game\" at the [[2017 Kids' Choice Awards]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7718233/kids-choice-awards-2017-the-winners-list | title = Kids' Choice Awards 2017: The Winners List | website = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate = April 7, 2017 | date = March 11, 2017}}</ref> and was nominated for \"Best Family/Social Game\" at the [[Fun & Serious Game Festival|Titanium Awards]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://en.funandseriousgamefestival.com/the-list-of-finalists-for-the-fun-serious-titanium-awards-has-been-revealed-2017/ | title = The list of finalists for the Fun & Serious Titanium Awards has been revealed | website = [[Fun & Serious Game Festival]] | accessdate = November 8, 2019 | year = 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website | http://just-dance.ubi.com/en-us/home/index.aspx }}\n\n{{Just Dance series}}\n{{Ubisoft Reflections}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Dance video games]]\n[[Category:Exergames]]\n[[Category:Just Dance (video game series)]]\n[[Category:Kinect games]]\n[[Category:Music video games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Network games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in France]]\n[[Category:Wii games]]\n[[Category:Wii U eShop games]]\n[[Category:Wii U games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox 360 games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title  = Just Dance 2017\n|image  = Just Dance 2017.jpg\n|caption  = \n|developer  = [[Ubisoft Paris]]<br/>[[Ubisoft Pune]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Only Ubisoft Paris & Ubisoft Pune are developing Just Dance 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrJpa70KI9I&t=100s|website=YouTube}}</ref><br>[[Ubisoft Reflections]]<br>[[Ubisoft Milan]]\n|publisher  = [[Ubisoft]]\n|series  = ''[[Just Dance (video game series)|Just Dance]]''\n|engine  =\n|platforms  = [[Microsoft Windows]]<br/>[[Wii]]<br/>[[Wii U]]<br/>[[PlayStation 3]]<br/>[[PlayStation 4]]<br/>[[Xbox 360]]<br/>[[Xbox One]]<br/>[[Nintendo Switch]]\n|released  = {{Video game release|NA|October 25, 2016|EU|October 27, 2016|UK|October 28, 2016|AU|October 29, 2016|CHN|April 28, 2017}} '''Nintendo Switch'''{{Video game release|WW|March 3, 2017}}\n|genre  = [[Dance video game|Dance]]\n|director  =\n|producer  = \n|composer  =\n}}\n\n'''''Just Dance 2017''''' is a [[dance video game]] developed and published by [[Ubisoft]].

It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible.
