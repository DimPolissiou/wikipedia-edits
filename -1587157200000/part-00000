European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The name \"\u015aankaram\" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill.

Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill.

These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh.

Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The name \"\u015aankaram\" derives from the [[Sangharama]] (temple or monastery). Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves. At Ligalametta there are hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows, spread across the hill. Among other Buddhist attractions are a relic casket, three [[chaitya]] halls, votive platforms, stupas and [[Vajrayana]] sculptures.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n{{-}}\n\n==== Bavikonda ====\n[[File:Bavikonda stupas.JPG|thumb|[[Bavikonda]] stupas|alt=Bavikonda Buddhist Complex]]\n\nBavikonda is an important Buddhist heritage site located on a hill about 15&nbsp;km, northeast from Visakhapatnam city. Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The word ''Bavikonda'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] means \"a hill of wells\". Fitting its name, Bavikonda is a hill with wells for the collection of rainwater. It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

Also, Bennington screamed parts of the verses during live performances. It was also included in the soundtrack of the 2001 film ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]''.\n\nOn Linkin Park's [[remix]] album ''[[Reanimation (Linkin Park album)|Reanimation]]'' (2002), there is a remix of this song, titled \"Ppr:Kut\", which was remixed by [[DJ Cheapshot|Cheapshot]]. Elements from the song were used in the song \"Sold My Soul to Yo Mama\", which appears on the ''Linkin Park Underground 4.0'' and ''Songs from the Underground''. Furthermore, the [[mashup (music)|mashup]] [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]'' (2004) contains a mix of this song and [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[Big Pimpin']]\", in 2005, the song was mashed-up with [[David Banner]]'s \"Like a Pimp (Remix)\" for the mixtape hosted by [[Mike Shinoda]] (the band's rapper and lead vocalist), [[Rock Phenomenon]], creating the song David Banner vs. Linkin Park.\n\nOn the band's previous single, \"[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]\", a live performance on the song was included as the single's b-side.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the band shortened the song from their set list, removing the second verse and the second chorus. However, the full version was brought back in 2017.\n\n==Music video==\n\nThe music video shows the band in a seemingly haunted house. They are playing the song in a room with little light with a rather spooky picture sampled from the cover artwork of the Xero demo tape. This was painted by Mike Shinoda the night before the video was shot. To the right of their room is a dark kitchen that sports a bound and writhing figure (likely the paranoid individual referenced in the song); to the left of their room is what appears to be a laboratory with a strange creature inside. It moves extremely fast and in an erratic manner.\n\nLater in the song, the creature releases dragonflies (probably referring to the wings of a [[Hybrid Theory|Hybrid Theory Soldier]]), while the baby picture and regions of the left wall bulge. Drummer Rob Bourdon's eyes appear melted as well (using [[special effects]]). Also, there is a statue of a bird which spins its head all the way around, and at one point, Shinoda's fingers stretch. There are parts of the song during which Shinoda is out of sync with the music, and at one point not even moving his mouth while he is speaking. In the video, the first member of the band to take notice of the strange goings-on is Bourdon (probably because he's the only one not playing an instrument), although bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell and vocalist Chester Bennington also start to notice the dragonflies and the bulgings on the wall towards the end of the video.\n\nThe lyrics of the song appear scribbled along the walls in the dark rooms. Even though the song features heavy distorted electric guitars, [[Brad Delson]] plays [[acoustic guitar]] and Phoenix plays [[Acoustic bass guitar|acoustic bass]] in the video. The effects and imagery of the music video bring to the audience a sense of irritation and certain paranoia, which is what the song is about. At some point in the middle of the video, around 2:03, a strange blue figure runs past the band. Also note that at the end after the screen flashes black once, the band is gone, but their instruments are left where the band members were.\n\nThe music video was co-directed by [[Nathan \"Karma\" Cox]] and LP's turntablist [[Joseph Hahn]] (who also directed the videos for \"[[Pts.OF.Athrty]]\" and \"[[In the End]]\"). It was not released for the [[United States of America|US]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.linkinpark.com/video/papercut-linkin-park-2 | title = Papercut (Official Video) on LinkinPark.com | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420161853/http://www.linkinpark.com/video/papercut-linkin-park-2 | archivedate = 2012-04-20 }} from www.linkinpark.com</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"Papercut\" the fourth single released from ''Hybrid Theory'' in the U.S, and only charted on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, where it peaked at number 32, although it stayed on the chart for 18 weeks.

Also, Bennington screamed parts of the verses during live performances. It was also included in the soundtrack of the 2001 film ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]''.\n\nOn Linkin Park's [[remix]] album ''[[Reanimation (Linkin Park album)|Reanimation]]'' (2002), there is a remix of this song, titled \"Ppr:Kut\", which was remixed by [[DJ Cheapshot|Cheapshot]]. Elements from the song were used in the song \"Sold My Soul to Yo Mama\", which appears on the ''Linkin Park Underground 4.0'' and ''Songs from the Underground''. Furthermore, the [[mashup (music)|mashup]] [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]'' (2004) contains a mix of this song and [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[Big Pimpin']]\", in 2005, the song was mashed-up with [[David Banner]]'s \"Like a Pimp (Remix)\" for the mixtape hosted by [[Mike Shinoda]] (the band's rapper and lead vocalist), [[Rock Phenomenon]], creating the song David Banner vs. Linkin Park.\n\nOn the band's previous single, \"[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]\", a live performance on the song was included as the single's b-side.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the band shortened the song from their set list, removing the second verse and the second chorus. However, the full version was brought back in 2017.\n\n==Music video==\n\nThe music video shows the band in a seemingly haunted house. They are playing the song in a room with little light with a rather spooky picture sampled from the cover artwork of the Xero demo tape. This was painted by Mike Shinoda the night before the video was shot. To the right of their room is a dark kitchen that sports a bound and writhing figure (likely the paranoid individual referenced in the song); to the left of their room is what appears to be a laboratory with a strange creature inside. It moves extremely fast and in an erratic manner.\n\nLater in the song, the creature releases dragonflies (probably referring to the wings of a [[Hybrid Theory|Hybrid Theory Soldier]]), while the baby picture and regions of the left wall bulge. Drummer Rob Bourdon's eyes appear melted as well (using [[special effects]]). Also, there is a statue of a bird which spins its head all the way around, and at one point, Shinoda's fingers stretch. There are parts of the song during which Shinoda is out of sync with the music, and at one point not even moving his mouth while he is speaking. In the video, the first member of the band to take notice of the strange goings-on is Bourdon (probably because he's the only one not playing an instrument), although bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell and vocalist Chester Bennington also start to notice the dragonflies and the bulgings on the wall towards the end of the video.\n\nThe lyrics of the song appear scribbled along the walls in the dark rooms. Even though the song features heavy distorted electric guitars, [[Brad Delson]] plays [[acoustic guitar]] and Phoenix plays [[Acoustic bass guitar|acoustic bass]] in the video. The effects and imagery of the music video bring to the audience a sense of irritation and certain paranoia, which is what the song is about. At some point in the middle of the video, around 2:03, a strange blue figure runs past the band. Also note that at the end after the screen flashes black once, the band is gone, but their instruments are left where the band members were.\n\nThe music video was co-directed by [[Nathan \"Karma\" Cox]] and LP's turntablist [[Joseph Hahn]] (who also directed the videos for \"[[Pts.OF.Athrty]]\" and \"[[In the End]]\"). It was not released for the [[United States of America|US]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.linkinpark.com/video/papercut-linkin-park-2 | title = Papercut (Official Video) on LinkinPark.com | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420161853/http://www.linkinpark.com/video/papercut-linkin-park-2 | archivedate = 2012-04-20 }} from www.linkinpark.com</ref>\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"Papercut\" the fourth single released from ''Hybrid Theory'' in the U.S, and only charted on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, where it peaked at number 32, although it stayed on the chart for 18 weeks.

He was general manager and vice president of [[CBS News]] from 1961 to 1964, and later became editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine.  He was Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s national campaign manager for the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential nomination]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nClark was born in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]] in 1917, the son of [[William Clark (judge)|Wiliam Clark]] (1891\u20131957) and Marjory ([[n\u00e9e]] Blair) Clark (1893\u20131975).<ref name=\"MBCObit1975\">{{cite news|title=MARJORY B.

In 1940 he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from [[Harvard College]], where he was a member of the [[Spee Club (Harvard)|Spee Club]] and [[Hasty Pudding Club|Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770]].<ref name=\"1941Wedding\"/> He was also the editor and president of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E3DC133FF93BA35755C0A9669C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%2CTopics/People/P/Pace,%2CEric | title=Blair Clark, 82, CBS Executive Who Led McCarthy's '68 Race  - New York Times | date=2000-06-08 | accessdate=2008-03-20 | work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Pace}}</ref>\n\nClark had a knack for connecting with talented and ambitious people.  At [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], Clark became friends with poet [[Robert Lowell]].  At Harvard he befriended classmate [[John F.

The newspaper's star reporter was [[Ben Bradlee]], who was also an alumnus of St. Mark's and Harvard and would later become executive editor of the [[Washington Post]]. Within two years, the ''Sunday News'' had the highest circulation in New Hampshire. When the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'' threatened to compete with its own Sunday paper, Clark sold the ''Sunday News'' to Union-Leader Corporation in 1948 for a substantial profit.<ref name=Kaiser>Kaiser, Charles.

Patton Jr.]]'s 3rd Army.<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n===CBS===\nIn 1953, he joined [[CBS News]] in Paris, and later became producer and anchor of ''The World Tonight'' on the [[CBS Radio Network]], now known as the nighttime edition of the ''[[CBS World News Roundup]].'' In 1961, President Kennedy offered Clark the ambassadorship to Mexico, but instead he became general manager and vice president of CBS News. He expanded the radio and television coverage of CBS News by hiring additional correspondents in the United States and abroad.  He worked with [[Edward R. Murrow]], and among those he hired at CBS were [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Mike Wallace]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Roger Mudd]] and [[Bill Plante]].<ref name=Princeton/><ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nAfter leaving CBS, Clark was associate publisher of the ''[[New York Post]]'', editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, and a fellow of the New York Institute for Humanities at [[New York University]]. He was an influential early supporter of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Subsequently, he taught at [[New York University]] and [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n=== Career in politics ===\n\nClark first met Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1965 at a party at [[Walter Lippmann]]'s house in [[Washington, D.C.]] Two years later, when McCarthy announced that he would challenge President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 1968 Democratic primaries as an anti-war candidate, Clark wrote to McCarthy from London to express his support. With his friend [[Theodore H. White]], Clark traveled to Chicago in December 1967 to hear McCarthy address the Conference of Concerned Democrats, a group of antiwar activists. Soon after meeting in Chicago, McCarthy asked Clark to be his campaign manager.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nIn his new position within the campaign, Clark set about convincing McCarthy to enter the [[New Hampshire]] [[New Hampshire primary|primary]]. McCarthy had initially planned to skip New Hampshire and begin campaigning in [[Wisconsin]]. The case to run in New Hampshire was laid out by two members of the New Hampshire delegation of the Conference of Concerned Democrats: [[Dartmouth College]] official [[David C. Hoeh]] and [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] teacher (and future congressman) [[Gerry Studds]]. After more convincing from Clark, McCarthy decided that he would declare his entry to the New Hampshire primary. Hoeh and Studds took the titles of New Hampshire campaign director and coordinator, and Clark recruited the journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] to be McCarthy's press secretary.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nMcCarthy's surprisingly strong showing in New Hampshire led to the rapid growth of his supporters, but the campaign was in increasing disarray. When Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] entered the race as a second anti-war candidate, Clark and other McCarthy advisers initially tried to broker an agreement with Kennedy to meet head-to-head only in the California primary, with both campaigns supporting the winner of that primary, but McCarthy flatly rejected the proposal. Bitterness between the McCarthy and Kennedy campaigns only deepened after Johnson announced that he would not seek re-election and [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged as the choice of the Democratic establishment. In the wake of Kennedy's assassination the night that he won the California primary, many Kennedy delegates to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] refused to support McCarthy. McCarthy publicly conceded that Humphrey had enough delegates to win the nomination, a move that enraged Clark and other McCarthy supporters who felt that the candidate still had a chance of defeating Humphrey.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nClark's sister [[Anne Clark Martindell]] also attended the Democratic National Convention as a McCarthy supporter, launching her career in politics and public service. She would go on to serve in the [[New Jersey Senate]] and as [[United States Ambassador to New Zealand]].\n\nClark later became treasurer of the New Democratic Coalition, a group of disaffected liberals from the 1968 campaign. When the [[Watergate]] break-in occurred, Clark was the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s communications director.<ref name=Princeton/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1941,<ref name=\"1941Wedding\">{{cite news|title=Miss Jessie Philbin Married in Boston To L.

He was Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s national campaign manager for the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential nomination]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nClark was born in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]] in 1917, the son of [[William Clark (judge)|Wiliam Clark]] (1891\u20131957) and Marjory ([[n\u00e9e]] Blair) Clark (1893\u20131975).<ref name=\"MBCObit1975\">{{cite news|title=MARJORY B.

At [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], Clark became friends with poet [[Robert Lowell]].  At Harvard he befriended classmate [[John F. Kennedy]]; they remained in touch throughout Kennedy's political career, and Clark and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] corresponded for decades. Journalist [[Theodore H. White]] was also a long-time contact.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1941 to 1946, Clark reported for the [[Joseph Pulitzer Jr.]]-owned ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' before serving in the [[United States Army]].<ref name=Princeton>{{Cite web | url=http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/eadGetDoc.xq?id=/ead/mudd/publicpolicy/MC195.EAD.xml | title=Blair Clark Papers, 1921-1997 (bulk 1950s-1990s): Finding Aid | accessdate=2008-03-20 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410105250/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/eadGetDoc.xq?id=%2Fead%2Fmudd%2Fpublicpolicy%2FMC195.EAD.xml | archivedate=2008-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n===New Hampshire Sunday News===\nIn 1946, Clark used a $60,000 inheritance from his grandmother to found ''The New Hampshire Sunday News''. The newspaper's star reporter was [[Ben Bradlee]], who was also an alumnus of St. Mark's and Harvard and would later become executive editor of the [[Washington Post]]. Within two years, the ''Sunday News'' had the highest circulation in New Hampshire. When the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'' threatened to compete with its own Sunday paper, Clark sold the ''Sunday News'' to Union-Leader Corporation in 1948 for a substantial profit.<ref name=Kaiser>Kaiser, Charles.

Patton Jr.]]'s 3rd Army.<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n===CBS===\nIn 1953, he joined [[CBS News]] in Paris, and later became producer and anchor of ''The World Tonight'' on the [[CBS Radio Network]], now known as the nighttime edition of the ''[[CBS World News Roundup]].'' In 1961, President Kennedy offered Clark the ambassadorship to Mexico, but instead he became general manager and vice president of CBS News. He expanded the radio and television coverage of CBS News by hiring additional correspondents in the United States and abroad.  He worked with [[Edward R. Murrow]], and among those he hired at CBS were [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Mike Wallace]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Roger Mudd]] and [[Bill Plante]].<ref name=Princeton/><ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nAfter leaving CBS, Clark was associate publisher of the ''[[New York Post]]'', editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, and a fellow of the New York Institute for Humanities at [[New York University]]. He was an influential early supporter of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Subsequently, he taught at [[New York University]] and [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n=== Career in politics ===\n\nClark first met Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1965 at a party at [[Walter Lippmann]]'s house in [[Washington, D.C.]] Two years later, when McCarthy announced that he would challenge President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 1968 Democratic primaries as an anti-war candidate, Clark wrote to McCarthy from London to express his support. With his friend [[Theodore H. White]], Clark traveled to Chicago in December 1967 to hear McCarthy address the Conference of Concerned Democrats, a group of antiwar activists. Soon after meeting in Chicago, McCarthy asked Clark to be his campaign manager.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nIn his new position within the campaign, Clark set about convincing McCarthy to enter the [[New Hampshire]] [[New Hampshire primary|primary]]. McCarthy had initially planned to skip New Hampshire and begin campaigning in [[Wisconsin]]. The case to run in New Hampshire was laid out by two members of the New Hampshire delegation of the Conference of Concerned Democrats: [[Dartmouth College]] official [[David C. Hoeh]] and [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] teacher (and future congressman) [[Gerry Studds]]. After more convincing from Clark, McCarthy decided that he would declare his entry to the New Hampshire primary. Hoeh and Studds took the titles of New Hampshire campaign director and coordinator, and Clark recruited the journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] to be McCarthy's press secretary.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nMcCarthy's surprisingly strong showing in New Hampshire led to the rapid growth of his supporters, but the campaign was in increasing disarray. When Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] entered the race as a second anti-war candidate, Clark and other McCarthy advisers initially tried to broker an agreement with Kennedy to meet head-to-head only in the California primary, with both campaigns supporting the winner of that primary, but McCarthy flatly rejected the proposal. Bitterness between the McCarthy and Kennedy campaigns only deepened after Johnson announced that he would not seek re-election and [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged as the choice of the Democratic establishment. In the wake of Kennedy's assassination the night that he won the California primary, many Kennedy delegates to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] refused to support McCarthy. McCarthy publicly conceded that Humphrey had enough delegates to win the nomination, a move that enraged Clark and other McCarthy supporters who felt that the candidate still had a chance of defeating Humphrey.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nClark's sister [[Anne Clark Martindell]] also attended the Democratic National Convention as a McCarthy supporter, launching her career in politics and public service. She would go on to serve in the [[New Jersey Senate]] and as [[United States Ambassador to New Zealand]].\n\nClark later became treasurer of the New Democratic Coalition, a group of disaffected liberals from the 1968 campaign. When the [[Watergate]] break-in occurred, Clark was the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s communications director.<ref name=Princeton/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1941,<ref name=\"1941Wedding\">{{cite news|title=Miss Jessie Philbin Married in Boston To L.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] forces under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] during the [[First Balkan War]]. The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the short [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first postwar Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by rearming and retraining the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] forces under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] during the [[First Balkan War]]. The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reservists]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively.

Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]]. On 30 May, the two sides signed the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] which granted the League's members all Ottoman lands west of [[Enos, Turkey|Enos]] on the [[Aegean Sea]] and north of [[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y|Midia]] on the [[Black Sea]], as well as Crete. The fate of [[Independent Albania|Albania]] and the Ottoman-held Aegean islands was to be determined by the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Great Powers]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=330\u2013332}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Apostolidis |first=Dimitrios |title=\u039f \u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1912-1913|trans-title=The Victorious Greco-Turkish War of 1912-1913|volume=I|publisher=Estia|location=Athens|language=Greek|year=1913|url=https://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/8/d/1/metadata-9272bd94229998ed96a378ab0f986a22_1270023610.tkl|accessdate=13 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Georgios|last1=Christopoulos|first2=Ioannis|last2=Bastias|title=\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2: \u039d\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf 1881 \u03c9\u03c2 1913|trans-title=History of the Greek Nation: Modern Greece from 1881 until 1913 |volume=XIV |publisher=Ekdotiki Athinon|language=Greek|location=Athens|year=1977 |isbn=960-213-110-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dimitracopoulos |first=Anastasios |title=The First Balkan War Through the Pages of Review L'Illustration |year=1992 |publisher=Hellenic Committee of Military History|location=Athens |oclc= 37043754| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Edward |title=Defeat in Detail: The Ottoman Army in the Balkans, 1912-1913 |year=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport | isbn =978-0-275-97888-4| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hooton |first=Edward|title=Prelude to the First World War: The Balkan Wars 1912-1913 |year=2014|publisher=Fonthill Media|location=Stroud | isbn =978-1781551806  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kargakos |first=Sarandos| title=\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (1912-1913)|trans-title=Greece in the Balkan Wars (1912-1913)| publisher=Peritechnon|location=Athens| year = 2012 | isbn =978-960-8411-26-5|language=Greek| ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Katsikostas |first=Dimitrios |title=\u0397 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 Eydoux|trans-title=The Reorganization of the Armed Forces and the Efforts of the French Military Mission of Eydoux|publisher= Hellenic Army History Directorate |language=Greek|year= 2014 |url=https://dis.army.gr/sites/dis.army.gr/files/unmanaged/pdf/Articles_June14/Greek_French/ANADIORG_ED_APOST_EYDOUX.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2019 | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Klapsis |first=Antonis |date=2009 |title=Between the Hammer and the Anvil.
