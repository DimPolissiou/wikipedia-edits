No wrestling,{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} no takedowns, and no submission holds. The only exception to the rule is a clinch when one is shocked.\n* If one is by the opponent, one may try to enter into a clinch under-hook (hold under both arms) to recover. Upon recovery, the fighter must escape the clinch. A throw from a clinch results in disqualification. [[Muay Thai]] clinches are disallowed: on the first occurrence, the combat may continue with a warning; if it recurs, a second warning is followed by disqualification.\n* No takedowns.  A second takedown in a match means disqualification.\n* The opponent cannot be finished off on the ground. If one occurrence does not stop the fight, the combat can continue.

In a draw after additional rounds, the judges evaluate the fight as a whole.
