The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine ''Media Bypass'', was distributed worldwide by the [[Associated Press]] on May 29, 1998. This was written in the midst of the 1998 [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003|Iraq disarmament crisis]] and a few months before [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|Operation Desert Fox]].\n\n{{quote|The administration has said that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]] has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons (\"[[weapons of mass destruction]]\") \u2014 mainly because they have used them in the past.\n\nWell, if that's the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its \"[[Cold War]]\" with the Soviet Union. Why, then, it is invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence) with respect to Iraq's (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?\n\nThe administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past. We've all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons. But, have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nI suggest that one study the histories of [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and other \"regional conflicts\" that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of \"weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nRemember [[Firebombing of Dresden|Dresden]]? How about [[Operation Linebacker II|Hanoi]]? [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Tripoli]]? [[Gulf War|Baghdad]]? What about the big ones \u2014 [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]? (At these two locations, the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 in the blink of an eye. Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).\n\nIf Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of \"mass destruction\" \u2014 like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?\n\nThe truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}\n\nThe essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:\n\n{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes \"a shield.\" Think about it.\n\nWhen considering morality and \"mens rea\" [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...\n\nI find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed \"The Spirit of Oklahoma.\" This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.\n\nUnfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.\n\nThese are weapons of mass destruction \u2014 and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.\n\nWhether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}\n\nMcVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan.

The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine ''Media Bypass'', was distributed worldwide by the [[Associated Press]] on May 29, 1998. This was written in the midst of the 1998 [[Iraq disarmament timeline 1990\u20132003|Iraq disarmament crisis]] and a few months before [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|Operation Desert Fox]].\n\n{{quote|The administration has said that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]] has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons (\"[[weapons of mass destruction]]\") \u2014 mainly because they have used them in the past.\n\nWell, if that's the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its \"[[Cold War]]\" with the Soviet Union. Why, then, it is invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence) with respect to Iraq's (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?\n\nThe administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past. We've all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons. But, have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nI suggest that one study the histories of [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and other \"regional conflicts\" that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of \"weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nRemember [[Firebombing of Dresden|Dresden]]? How about [[Operation Linebacker II|Hanoi]]? [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Tripoli]]? [[Gulf War|Baghdad]]? What about the big ones \u2014 [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]? (At these two locations, the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 in the blink of an eye. Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).\n\nIf Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of \"mass destruction\" \u2014 like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?\n\nThe truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}\n\nThe essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:\n\n{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes \"a shield.\" Think about it.\n\nWhen considering morality and \"mens rea\" [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...\n\nI find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed \"The Spirit of Oklahoma.\" This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhen a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.\n\nUnfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.\n\nThese are weapons of mass destruction \u2014 and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.\n\nWhether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}\n\nMcVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan.

Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', de{{nbsp}}Havilland achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as ''The Great Garrick'' and ''Hard to Get'', and Western adventure films, such as ''Dodge City'' and ''Santa Fe Trail''.<ref name=\"tcm-filmography\"/> In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as ''In This Our Life'' and ''Light in the Piazza'', and psychological dramas playing non-glamorous characters in films such as ''The Dark Mirror'', ''The Snake Pit'', and ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''.<ref name=\"tcm-bio\"/>\n\nDuring her career, de{{nbsp}}Havilland won two Academy Awards (''To Each His Own'' and ''The Heiress''), two Golden Globe Awards (''The Heiress'' and ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna''), two New York Film Critics Circle Awards (''The Snake Pit'' and ''The Heiress''), the National Board of Review Award, and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup (''The Snake Pit''), and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination (''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'').<ref name=\"tcm-milestones\"/>\n\nFor her contributions to the motion picture industry, de{{nbsp}}Havilland received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6762 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.<ref name=\"hollywood-walk\"/> Since her retirement in 1988, her lifetime contribution to the arts has been honored on two continents.
