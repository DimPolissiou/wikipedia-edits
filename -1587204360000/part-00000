She is currently the head coach for [[Triplets (basketball)|Triplets]] in the [[BIG3]] professional basketball league, as well as a studio analyst for [[Orlando Magic]] broadcasts on [[Fox Sports Florida]]. Leslie played in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). She is a three-time WNBA [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] and a four-time Olympic gold medal winner. The number-seven pick in the 1997 inaugural WNBA draft, she followed her career at the [[University of Southern California]] with eight WNBA All-Star selections and two [[WNBA Championship|WNBA championships]] over the course of eleven seasons with the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], before retiring in 2009.<ref name=\"nbc\" /> Leslie was the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. In 2015, she was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]. Leslie was also inducted into the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nLeslie was born in Gardena, California, the daughter of Christine Lauren Leslie, who stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}}, and Walter Leslie, a semi-professional basketball player.  Christine started her own [[truck driver|truck driving]] business to support her three children. Walter left the family when her mother was four months pregnant with her.<ref name=\"porter\"/> Leslie has two sisters: Dionne, who is five years older, and Tiffany, who is eight years younger. She also has a brother, Elgin (named after [[Elgin Baylor]] of the LA Lakers). She played on an all-girls team with the record 33\u20131.<ref name=\"jockbio\">{{cite web |url=http://jockbio.com/Bios/Leslie/Leslie_bio.html |title=Lisa Leslie Biography |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |publisher=Black Book Partners |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===Middle school===\nDuring the first few weeks of middle school, a classmate begged Leslie to help out the basketball team.<ref name=\"grundy\" /> On her first day of basketball tryouts, team members were told to split into two groups for layup drills: [[Handedness|lefties]] and [[Handedness|righties]]. Leslie was the only lefty in the group, so from then on, she decided to become right-hand dominant so she would not have to stand in a line by herself. That decision worked to her advantage, as she became ambidextrous.<ref name=\"lipstick\">Leslie, Lisa, and Larry Barnett. Don't Let the Lipstick Fool You. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp., 2008</ref>\n\nIn eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls' basketball team, and joined a boys' basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence in her playing abilities.<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\n===High school===\nAt the age of 14, before Leslie had even started high school at Morningside, she received more than a hundred college recruiting letters, including some from top [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] programs at the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|University of Tennessee]] and [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\nLeslie continued her education in 1986 by enrolling at [[Morningside High School]] in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref name=\"porter\" /> She made an immediate impact on the basketball program, starting every game for the girl's varsity team. She also found time to join the volleyball team and compete in track and field. She ended up being a state qualifier in the 400-meter run and the high jump.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />\n\nBy the time she was a sophomore in high school, she was able to dunk the ball in the open court, even though she was not able to palm the ball. She was her team's leading scorer and rebounder and led them to the 1989 California state championship. Leslie was so talented that she was invited to participate in the USA's Junior World Championship team.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />  Entering her senior year, she developed into the top player in the country. She led her team to a state championship averaging 27 points and 15 rebounds per game.<ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n==College career==\nLeslie decided to stay close to home and attend women's  basketball powerhouse the [[University of Southern California]] from 1990\u20131994.<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.makeithappen.com/wis/bios/lesliel.html |title=Women in Sports |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Meyer, Jan |publisher= |year=1997}}</ref> She graduated from USC with a bachelor's degree in communications and later completed her master's degree in business administration<ref name=\"peter\">{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/news?slug=jo-leslie072108&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Day in the life of Lisa Leslie |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Peter, Josh |publisher=Yahoo |date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> from the [[University of Phoenix]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7DE113CF934A25752C0A96F9C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all SPORTS OF THE TIMES; University Sells Itself During Playoffs] NYTimes Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.wireimage.com/ItemListings.aspx?igi=66148&nbc1=1 [[Los Angeles Sparks]] Lisa Leslie Receives her Masters at University of Phoenix]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} WireImage Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref>\n\nLeslie played in a total of 120 college games, averaging 20.1 points, hitting 53.4% of her shots, and knocking down 69.8% of her free throws.

She is currently the head coach for [[Triplets (basketball)|Triplets]] in the [[BIG3]] professional basketball league, as well as a studio analyst for [[Orlando Magic]] broadcasts on [[Fox Sports Florida]]. Leslie played in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). She is a three-time WNBA [[WNBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] and a four-time Olympic gold medal winner. The number-seven pick in the 1997 inaugural WNBA draft, she followed her career at the [[University of Southern California]] with eight WNBA All-Star selections and two [[WNBA Championship|WNBA championships]] over the course of eleven seasons with the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], before retiring in 2009.<ref name=\"nbc\" /> Leslie was the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in WNBA history. In 2015, she was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]. Leslie was also inducted into the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nLeslie was born in Gardena, California, the daughter of Christine Lauren Leslie, who stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}}, and Walter Leslie, a semi-professional basketball player.  Christine started her own [[truck driver|truck driving]] business to support her three children. Walter left the family when her mother was four months pregnant with her.<ref name=\"porter\"/> Leslie has two sisters: Dionne, who is five years older, and Tiffany, who is eight years younger. She also has a brother, Elgin (named after [[Elgin Baylor]] of the LA Lakers). She played on an all-girls team with the record 33\u20131.<ref name=\"jockbio\">{{cite web |url=http://jockbio.com/Bios/Leslie/Leslie_bio.html |title=Lisa Leslie Biography |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |publisher=Black Book Partners |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===Middle school===\nDuring the first few weeks of middle school, a classmate begged Leslie to help out the basketball team.<ref name=\"grundy\" /> On her first day of basketball tryouts, team members were told to split into two groups for layup drills: [[Handedness|lefties]] and [[Handedness|righties]]. Leslie was the only lefty in the group, so from then on, she decided to become right-hand dominant so she would not have to stand in a line by herself. That decision worked to her advantage, as she became ambidextrous.<ref name=\"lipstick\">Leslie, Lisa, and Larry Barnett. Don't Let the Lipstick Fool You. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp., 2008</ref>\n\nIn eighth grade, she transferred to a junior high school without a girls' basketball team, and joined a boys' basketball team. Her success there contributed to her confidence in her playing abilities.<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\n===High school===\nAt the age of 14, before Leslie had even started high school at Morningside, she received more than a hundred college recruiting letters, including some from top [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] programs at the [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|University of Tennessee]] and [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"lipstick\" />\n\nLeslie continued her education in 1986 by enrolling at [[Morningside High School]] in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref name=\"porter\" /> She made an immediate impact on the basketball program, starting every game for the girl's varsity team. She also found time to join the volleyball team and compete in track and field. She ended up being a state qualifier in the 400-meter run and the high jump.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />\n\nBy the time she was a sophomore in high school, she was able to dunk the ball in the open court, even though she was not able to palm the ball. She was her team's leading scorer and rebounder and led them to the 1989 California state championship. Leslie was so talented that she was invited to participate in the USA's Junior World Championship team.<ref name=\"jockbio\" />  Entering her senior year, she developed into the top player in the country. She led her team to a state championship averaging 27 points and 15 rebounds per game.<ref name=\"porter\" />\n\n==College career==\nLeslie decided to stay close to home and attend women's  basketball powerhouse the [[University of Southern California]] from 1990\u20131994.<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.makeithappen.com/wis/bios/lesliel.html |title=Women in Sports |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Meyer, Jan |publisher= |year=1997}}</ref> She graduated from USC with a bachelor's degree in communications and later completed her master's degree in business administration<ref name=\"peter\">{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/news?slug=jo-leslie072108&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Day in the life of Lisa Leslie |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |author=Peter, Josh |publisher=Yahoo |date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> from the [[University of Phoenix]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E7DE113CF934A25752C0A96F9C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all SPORTS OF THE TIMES; University Sells Itself During Playoffs] NYTimes Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.wireimage.com/ItemListings.aspx?igi=66148&nbc1=1 [[Los Angeles Sparks]] Lisa Leslie Receives her Masters at University of Phoenix]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} WireImage Website, Accessed March 20, 2009</ref>\n\nLeslie played in a total of 120 college games, averaging 20.1 points, hitting 53.4% of her shots, and knocking down 69.8% of her free throws.

While including several other definitions, the OED 3rd edition defines ''risk'' as:\n\n<blockquote>(Exposure to) the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility.<ref>{{Cite OED|risk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== International Organization for Standardization ===\n\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) Guide 73 provides basic vocabulary to develop common understanding on risk management concepts and terms across different applications. ISO Guide 73:2009 defines risk as:\n \n<blockquote>effect of uncertainty on objectives\nNote 1: An effect is a deviation from the expected \u2013 positive or negative.\n\nNote 2: Objectives can have different aspects (such as financial, health and safety, and environmental goals) and can apply at different levels (such as strategic, organization-wide, project, product and process).\n\nNote 3: Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events and consequences or a combination of these.\n\nNote 4: Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and the associated likelihood of occurrence.\n\nNote 5: Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to, understanding or knowledge of, an event, its consequence, or likelihood.<ref name=\"ISOGuide73\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:guide:73:ed-1:v1:en|title=Guide 73:2009 Risk Management - Vocabulary|website=ISO}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis definition was developed by an international committee representing over 30 countries and is based on the input of several thousand subject matter experts. It was first adopted in 2002. Its complexity reflects the difficulty of satisfying fields that use the term risk in different ways. Some restrict the term to negative impacts (\u201cdownside risks\u201d), while others include positive impacts (\u201cupside risks\u201d). \n\n[[ISO 31000]]:2018 \u201cRisk management \u2014 Principles\u201d uses the same definition with a simpler set of notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:31000:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management - Guidelines|website=ISO}}</ref>\n\n=== Other ===\n\nMany other definitions of risk have been influential:\n\n:\u201cSource of harm\u201d. The earliest use of the word \u201crisk\u201d was as a synonym for the much older word \u201c[[hazard]]\u201d, meaning a potential source of harm. This definition comes from Blount\u2019s \u201cGlossographia\u201d (1661)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Glossographia, or, A dictionary interpreting all such hard words of whatsoever language now used in our refined English tongue|last=Blount|first=Thomas|year=1661|location=London}}</ref> and was the main definition in the OED 1st (1914) and 2nd (1989) editions. Modern equivalents refer to \u201cunwanted events\u201d <ref name=\"Stanford\">Hansson, Sven Ove, [https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/risk/ \"Risk\"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2018 Edition)'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</ref> or \u201csomething bad that might happen\u201d.<ref name=\"Cambridge\"/>\n\n:\u201cChance of harm\u201d. This definition comes from Johnson\u2019s \u201cDictionary of the English Language\u201d (1755), and has been widely paraphrased, including \u201cpossibility of loss\u201d <ref>{{Cite OED|risk}}</ref> or \u201cprobability of unwanted events\u201d.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n:\u201cUncertainty about loss\u201d.

The probability of an event multiplied by its magnitude was proposed as a definition of risk by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (1975),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rasmussen |title=An Assessment of Accident Risks in U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Plants |date=1975 |publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission |ref=WASH-1400}}</ref> and remains widely used.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/> It is properly known as the \u2018expectation value\u2019.\n\n:\u201cLikelihood and severity of events\u201d. The \u201ctriplet\u201d definition of risk as \u201cscenarios, probabilities and consequences\u201d was proposed by Kaplan & Garrick (1981).<ref name=\"Kaplan&Garrick\">{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=S. |last2=Garrick |first2=B.J. |title=On the Quantitative Definition of Risk |journal=Risk Analysis |date=1981 |volume=1 |issue=1}}</ref> Many definitions refer to the likelihood/probability of events/effects/losses of different severity/consequence, e.g. ISO Guide 73 Note 4.<ref name=\"ISOGuide73\"/>\n\n:\u201cConsequences and associated uncertainty\u201d. This was proposed by Kaplan & Garrick (1981).<ref name=\"Kaplan&Garrick\"/> This definition is preferred in Bayesian analysis, which sees risk as the combination of events and uncertainties about them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aven |first1=Terje |title=Quantitative Risk Assessment \u2013 The Scientific Platform |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n:\u201cUncertain events affecting objectives\u201d.

This definition was adopted by the UK Cabinet Office (2002)<ref>{{cite book |title=Risk: Improving government\u2019s capability to handle risk and uncertainty |date=2002 |publisher=Cabinet Office Strategy Unit |url=http://www.integra.com.bo/articulos/RISK%20IMPROVING%20GOVERMENT.pdf}}</ref> to encourage innovation to improve public services. It allowed \u201crisk\u201d to describe either \u201cpositive opportunity or negative threat of actions and events\u201d.\n\n:\u201cHuman interaction with uncertainty\u201d. This definition comes from Cline (2015)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cline|first1=Preston B. |title=The Merging of Risk Analysis and Adventure Education|journal=Wilderness Risk Management|date=3 March 2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=43\u201345|url=https://www.outdoored.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/wrmc_proceedings_05_adventure_cline.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> in the context of adventure education.\n\nSome resolve these differences by arguing that the definition of risk is subjective. For example:\n\n<blockquote>No definition is advanced as the correct one, because there is no one definition that is suitable for all problems. Rather, the choice of definition is a political one, expressing someone\u2019s views regarding the importance of different adverse effects in a particular situation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fischhoff |first1=B |last2=Watson |first2=S.R. |last3=Hope |first3=C. |title=Defining Risk |journal=Policy Sciences |date=1984 |issue=17 |pages=123-139}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Society for Risk Analysis]] concludes that \u201cexperience has shown that to agree on one unified set of definitions is not realistic\u201d. The solution is \u201cto allow for different perspectives on fundamental concepts and make a distinction between overall qualitative definitions and their associated measurements.\u201d<ref name=\"SRA2018\"/>\n\n==Practice areas==\nRisk is ubiquitous in all areas of life and [[risk management]] is something that we all must do, whether we are managing a major organisation or simply crossing the road.  When describing risk however, it is convenient to consider that risk practitioners operate in some specific practice areas.\n\n===Economic risk===\n\nEconomic risks can be manifested in lower incomes or higher expenditures than expected. The causes can be many, for instance, the hike in the price for raw materials, the lapsing of deadlines for construction of a new operating facility, disruptions in a production process, emergence of a serious competitor on the market, the loss of key personnel, the change of a political regime, or [[natural disasters]].\n\n===Health===\nRisks in personal health may be reduced by [[primary prevention]] actions that decrease early causes of illness or by [[secondary prevention]] actions after a person has clearly measured clinical signs or symptoms recognised as risk factors. Tertiary [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] reduces the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion of [[risk factors]] with individual patients to obtain [[informed consent]] for secondary and tertiary prevention efforts, whereas public health efforts in primary prevention require education of the entire population at risk. In each case, careful communication about risk factors, likely outcomes and [[certainty]] must distinguish between causal events that must be decreased and associated events that may be merely consequences rather than causes.\n\nIn epidemiology, the '''lifetime risk''' of an effect is the ''[[cumulative incidence]]'', also called ''incidence proportion'' over an entire lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |vauthors=Rychetnik L, Hawe P, Waters E, Barratt A, Frommer M |date=July 2004 |volume=58 |pages=538\u201345 |doi=10.1136/jech.2003.011585 |pmid=15194712 |pmc=1732833 |title=A glossary for evidence based public health |issue=7 }}</ref>\n\n===Health, safety, and environment===\nIn terms of occupational health & safety management, the term 'risk' may be defined as the most likely consequence of a hazard, combined with the likelihood or probability of it occurring.\n\nHealth, safety, and environment (HSE) are separate practice areas; however, they are often linked. The reason for this is typically to do with organizational management structures; however, there are strong links among these disciplines. One of the strongest links between these is that a single risk event may have impacts in all three areas, albeit over differing timescales. For example, the uncontrolled release of radiation or a toxic chemical may have immediate short-term safety consequences, more protracted health impacts, and much longer-term [[environmental impact]]s. Events such as [[Chernobyl]], for example, caused immediate deaths, and in the longer term, deaths from cancers, and left a lasting environmental impact leading to [[birth defect]]s, impacts on wildlife, etc.\n\nOver time, a form of risk analysis called '''environmental risk analysis''' has developed. Environmental risk analysis is a field of study that attempts to understand events and activities that bring risk to human health or the environment.<ref name=\"Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries\">{{cite journal|last=Gurjar|first=Bhola Ram|author2=Mohan, Manju |title=Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries|journal=Risk: Health, Safety & Environment|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/risk13&id=5&collection=journals&index=journals/risk|accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHuman health and environmental risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome (See [[adverse outcome pathway]]). As such, risk is a function of hazard and exposure. Hazard is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed, e.g. the toxicity of a chemical compound. Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard.

It can be considered as a form of contingent capital and is akin to purchasing an [[Option (finance)|option]] in which the buyer pays a small premium to be protected from a potential large loss.\n\nInsurance risk is often taken by insurance companies, who then bear a pool of risks including market risk, credit risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk, longevity risks, etc.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Elyasiani | first2 = Elyas | last3 = Mansur | first3 = Iqbal | year = 2008 | title = Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Interdependencies in Insurer Stock Returns: A System-GARCH Model | journal = The Journal of Risk and Insurance | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 873\u2013891 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6975.2008.00289.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.568.4087 }}</ref>\n\n===Business and management===\nMeans of assessing risk vary widely between professions. Indeed, they may define these professions; for example, a doctor manages medical risk, while a civil engineer manages risk of structural failure. A professional [[code of ethics]] is usually focused on risk assessment and mitigation (by the professional on behalf of client, public, society or life in general).\n\nIn the workplace, incidental and [[inherent risk]]s exist. Incidental risks are those that occur naturally in the business but are not part of the core of the business. Inherent risks have a negative effect on the operating profit of the business.\n\n===In human services===\nThe experience of many people who rely on human services for support is that 'risk' is often used as a reason to prevent them from gaining further independence or fully accessing the community, and that these services are often unnecessarily risk averse.<ref>A Positive Approach To Risk Requires Person Centred Thinking, Neill et al., Tizard Learning Disability Review http://pierprofessional.metapress.com/content/vr700311x66j0125/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"People's autonomy used to be compromised by institution walls, now it's too often our risk management practices\", according to [[John O'Brien (human services thinker)|John O'Brien]].<ref>John O'Brien cited in Sanderson, H.

Most studies of HROs involve areas such as nuclear aircraft carriers, air traffic control, aerospace and nuclear power stations. Organizations such as these share in common the ability to consistently operate safely in complex, interconnected environments where a single failure in one component could lead to catastrophe. Essentially, they are organisations which appear to operate 'in spite' of an enormous range of risks.\n\nSome of these industries manage risk in a highly quantified and enumerated way. These include the [[nuclear power]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aircraft industries]], where the possible failure of a complex series of engineered systems could result in highly undesirable outcomes. The usual measure of risk for a class of events is then: ''R'' = probability of the event \u00d7 the severity of the consequence.\n\nThe total risk is then the sum of the individual class-risks;  see below.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Safety, Reliability and Risk Analysis: Theory, Methods and Applications|last=Sebasti\u00e1n Martorell, Carlos Guedes Soares, Julie Barnett|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781482266481|location=|pages=671}}</ref>\n\nIn the nuclear industry, consequence is often measured in terms of off-site radiological release, and this is often banded into five or six-decade-wide bands.{{Clarify|reason=define \"decade-wide bands\":  factor of 10 regarding what?|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe risks are evaluated using fault tree/event tree techniques (see [[safety engineering]]). Where these risks are low, they are normally considered to be \"broadly acceptable\". A higher level of risk (typically up to 10 to 100 times what is considered broadly acceptable) has to be justified against the costs of reducing it further and the possible benefits that make it tolerable\u2014these risks are described as \"Tolerable if [[ALARP]]\", where ALARP stands for \"as low as reasonably practicable\". Risks beyond this level are classified as \"intolerable\".\n\nThe level of risk deemed broadly acceptable has been considered by regulatory bodies in various countries\u2014an early attempt by UK government regulator and academic [[F. R. Farmer]] used the example of hill-walking and similar activities, which have definable risks that people appear to find acceptable. This resulted in the so-called Farmer Curve of acceptable probability of an event versus its consequence.\n\nThe technique as a whole is usually referred to as probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) (or probabilistic safety assessment, PSA). See [[WASH-1400]] for an example of this approach.\n\n===Finance===\n{{Main|Financial risk}}\n\nIn finance, risk is the chance that the return achieved on an investment will be different from that expected, and also takes into account the size of the difference. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. In a view advocated by Damodaran, risk includes not only \"[[downside risk]]\" but also \"upside risk\" (returns that exceed expectations).<ref>{{cite book |title=Investment Philosophies: Successful Investment Philosophies and the Greatest Investors Who Made Them Work |first=Aswath |last=Damodaran |page=15 |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-34503-9}}</ref> Some regard the [[standard deviation]] of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment as providing some historical measure of risk; see modern portfolio theory. Financial risk may be market-dependent, determined by numerous market factors, or operational, resulting from fraudulent behaviour (e.g. [[Bernard Madoff]]).\n\nA fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return (see [[modern portfolio theory]]). The greater the potential return one might seek, the greater the risk that one generally assumes. A free market reflects this principle in the pricing of an instrument: strong demand for a safer instrument drives its price higher (and its return correspondingly lower) while weak demand for a riskier instrument drives its price lower (and its potential return thereby higher). For example, a US Treasury bond is considered to be one of the safest investments. In comparison to an investment or speculative grade corporate bond, US Treasury notes and bonds yield lower rates of return. The reason for this is that a corporation is more likely to default on debt than the US government. Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a correspondingly higher rate of return.\n\nA popular [[risk measure]] is [[Value-at-Risk]] (VaR).\n\nThere are different types of VaR: long term VaR, marginal VaR, factor VaR and shock VaR. The latter is used in measuring risk during the extreme market stress conditions.\n\nIn finance, ''risk'' has no single definition.\n\nArtzner et al.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Artzner | first1 = P. | last2 = Delbaen | first2 = F. | last3 = Eber | first3 = J.-M. | last4 = Heath | first4 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Coherent measures of risk | journal = Math.

Such an individual willingly pays a premium to assume risk (e.g. buys a lottery ticket).\n\n=== {{anchor|Risk in auditing}} Financial auditing ===\n{{Main|Audit risk}}\nThe [[audit risk|financial audit risk model]] expresses the risk of an [[auditor]] providing an inappropriate opinion (or material misstatement) of a commercial entity's financial statements. It can be analytically expressed as \n:<math> \\text{AR} = \\text{IR} \\times \\text{CR} \\times \\text{DR}</math>\nwhere AR is ''audit risk'', IR is ''[[Inherent risk (accounting)|inherent risk]]'', CR is ''control risk'' and DR is ''detection risk''.\n\nNote: As defined, audit risk does not consider the impact of an auditor misstatement and so is stated as a simple probability. The impact of misstatement must be considered when determining an acceptable audit risk.<ref>{{cite book|title = Risk Management and Corporate Governance: Interconnections in Law: Chapter: Risk Management from an accounting perspective | author = Arco van de Ven |pages = 16\u201317 |editors = Marijn van Daelen, Christoph van der Elst }}</ref>\n\n===Security===\n[[File:AT YOUR OWN RISK.svg|thumb|166px|'''AT YOUR OWN RISK'''<br />Popular labelling]]\nSecurity risk management involves protection of assets from harm caused by deliberate acts. A more detailed definition is: \"A security risk is any event that could result in the compromise of organizational assets i.e. the unauthorized use, loss, damage, disclosure or modification of organizational assets for the profit, personal interest or political interests of individuals, groups or other entities constitutes a compromise of the asset, and includes the risk of harm to people. Compromise of organizational assets may adversely affect the enterprise, its business units and their clients. As such, consideration of security risk is a vital component of risk management.\"<ref>Julian Talbot and Miles Jakeman ''Security Risk Management Body of Knowledge'', John Wiley & Sons, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Human factors===\n{{Main|Decision theory|Prospect theory}}\nOne of the growing areas of focus in risk management is the field of [[human factors]] where behavioural and organizational psychology underpin our understanding of risk based decision making. This field considers questions such as \"how do we make risk based decisions?\", \"why are we irrationally more scared of sharks and terrorists than we are of motor vehicles and medications?\"\n\nIn [[decision theory]], regret (and anticipation of regret) can play a significant part in decision-making, distinct from [[risk aversion]]<ref>Virine, L., & Trumper, M. ProjectThink. Gower. 2013</ref><ref>Virine, L., & Trumper, M. Project Risk Analysis Made Ridiculously Simple. World Scientific Publishing. 2017</ref>(preferring the status quo in case one becomes worse off).\n\n[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]<ref>Amos Tversky / Daniel Kahneman, 1981. \"The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice.\"{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}</ref> is a fundamental problem with all forms of risk assessment. In particular, because of [[bounded rationality]] (our brains get overloaded, so we take mental shortcuts), the risk of extreme events is discounted because the probability is too low to evaluate intuitively. As an example, one of the leading causes of death is [[road accident]]s caused by [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] \u2013 partly because any given driver frames the problem by largely or totally ignoring the risk of a serious or fatal accident.\n\nFor instance, an extremely disturbing event (an attack by hijacking, or [[moral hazard]]s) may be ignored in analysis despite the fact it has occurred and has a nonzero probability. Or, an event that everyone agrees is inevitable may be ruled out of analysis due to greed or an unwillingness to admit that it is believed to be inevitable. These human tendencies for error and [[wishful thinking]] often affect even the most rigorous applications of the [[scientific method]] and are a major concern of the [[philosophy of science]].\n\nAll [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision-making under uncertainty]] must consider [[cognitive bias]], [[cultural bias]], and notational bias: No group of people assessing risk is immune to \"[[groupthink]]\": acceptance of obviously wrong answers simply because it is socially painful to disagree, where there are [[conflicts of interest]].\n\nFraming involves other information that affects the outcome of a risky decision.  The right prefrontal cortex has been shown to take a more global perspective<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schatz | first1 = J. | last2 = Craft | first2 = S. | last3 = Koby | first3 = M. | last4 = DeBaun | first4 = M.

Rightward tapping or listening had the effect of narrowing attention such that the frame was ignored.  This is a practical way of manipulating regional cortical activation to affect risky decisions, especially because directed tapping or listening is easily done.\n\n===Psychology of risk taking===\n\nA growing area of research has been to examine various psychological aspects of risk taking. Researchers typically run randomised experiments with a treatment and control group to ascertain the effect of different psychological factors that may be associated with risk taking. Thus, positive and negative feedback about past risk taking can affect future risk taking. In an experiment, people who were led to believe they are very competent at decision making saw more opportunities in a risky choice and took more risks, while those led to believe they were not very competent saw more threats and took fewer risks.<ref>Krueger, Norris, and Peter R. Dickson. \"How believing in ourselves increases risk taking: perceived self-efficacy and opportunity recognition.\" Decision Sciences 25, no. 3 (1994): 385\u2013400.</ref>\n\n===Maintenance===\nThe concept of risk-based maintenance is an advanced form of [[Reliability centred maintenance]]. In case of chemical industries, apart from probability of failure, consequences of failure is also very important. Therefore, the selection of maintenance policies should be based on risk, instead of reliability. Risk-based maintenance methodology acts as a tool for maintenance planning and decision making to reduce the probability of failure and its consequences. In risk-based maintenance decision making, the maintenance resources can be used optimally based on the risk class (high, medium, or low) of equipment or machines, to achieve tolerable risk criteria.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.069 | pmid=16887261 | volume=142 | issue=3 | title=Risk-based maintenance\u2014Techniques and applications | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials | pages=653\u2013661 | last1 = Arunraj | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Maiti | first2 = J.}}</ref>\n\n===Cybersecurity<ref>noun. The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this.

In order to address cyber-risk, cybersecurity applies security to the supply chain, the design and production environment for a product or service, and the product itself in order to provide efficient and appropriate security commensurate with the value of the asset to the mission or business process.\n\n==Risk assessment and analysis==\n{{Main|Risk assessment|Operational risk management}}\nSince risk assessment and management is essential in security management, both are tightly related. Security assessment methodologies like [[CRAMM]] contain risk assessment modules as an important part of the first steps of the methodology. On the other hand, risk assessment methodologies like [[Mehari]] evolved to become security assessment methodologies. An [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard on risk management (Principles and guidelines on implementation) was published under code [[ISO 31000]] on 13 November 2009.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\nThere are many formal methods used to \"measure\" risk.\n\nOften the probability of a negative event is estimated by using the frequency of past similar events. Probabilities for rare failures may be difficult to estimate. This makes risk assessment difficult in hazardous industries, for example nuclear energy, where the frequency of failures is rare, while harmful consequences of failure are severe.\n\nStatistical methods may also require the use of a [[Loss function|cost function]], which in turn may require the calculation of the cost of loss of a human life. This is a difficult problem. One approach is to ask what people are willing to pay to insure against death<ref>{{Cite news|first = Steven|last = Landsburg|title = Is your life worth $10&nbsp;million?|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2079475/|work = Everyday Economics|publisher = Slate|date = 3 March 2003|accessdate = 17 March 2008}}</ref> or radiological release (e.g. GBq of radio-iodine), {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but as the answers depend very strongly on the circumstances it is not clear that this approach is effective.\n\nRisk is often measured as the [[expected value]] of an undesirable outcome. This combines the probabilities of various possible events and some assessment of the corresponding harm into a single value. See also [[Expected utility]].  The simplest case is a binary possibility of ''Accident'' or ''No accident''. The associated formula for calculating risk is then:\n\n:<math> \\text{R} = (\\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \\times  (\\text{expected loss in case of the accident})</math>\n\nFor example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, then total risk is a loss of 10, the product of 0.01 and 1000.\n\nSituations are sometimes more complex than the simple binary possibility case. In a situation with several possible accidents, total risk is the sum of the risks for each different accident, provided that the outcomes are comparable:\n\n:<math> \\text{R} =  \\sum_\\text{For all accidents} (\\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \\times  (\\text{expected loss in case of the accident})</math>\n\nFor example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, and a probability of 0.000001 of suffering an accident of type ''B'', with a loss of 2,000,000, then total loss expectancy is 12, which is equal to a loss of 10 from an accident of type ''A'' and 2 from an accident of type ''B''.\n\nOne of the first major uses of this concept was for the planning of the [[Delta Works]] in 1953, a flood protection program in the [[Netherlands]], with the aid of the mathematician [[David van Dantzig]].<ref>[[Wired Magazine]], [https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/17-01/ff_dutch_delta?currentPage=3 Before the levees break], page 3.</ref> The kind of risk analysis pioneered there has become common today in fields like nuclear power, [[aerospace]] and the [[chemical industry]].\n\nIn statistical decision theory, the [[risk function]] is defined as the expected value of a given [[loss function]] as a function of the [[decision rule]] used to make decisions in the face of uncertainty.\n\n===Fear as intuitive risk assessment===\nPeople may rely on their [[fear processing in the brain|fear]] and hesitation to keep them out of the most profoundly unknown circumstances. Fear is a response to perceived danger. Risk could be said to be the way we collectively measure and share this \"true fear\"\u2014a fusion of rational doubt, irrational fear, and a set of unquantified biases from our own experience.\n\nThe field of [[behavioural finance]] focuses on human risk-aversion, asymmetric regret, and other ways that human financial behaviour varies from what analysts call \"rational\". Risk in that case is the degree of [[uncertainty]] associated with a [[return (finance)|return]] on an asset.  Recognizing and respecting the irrational influences on human decision making may do much to reduce disasters caused by naive risk assessments that presume rationality but in fact merely fuse many shared biases.\n\n==Anxiety, risk and decision making==\n\n===Fear, anxiety and risk===\nAccording to one set of definitions, fear is a fleeting emotion ascribed to a particular object, while [[anxiety]] is a trait of fear (this is referring to \"trait anxiety\", as distinct from how the term \"anxiety\" is generally used) that lasts longer and is not attributed to a specific stimulus (these particular definitions are not used by all authors cited on this page).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartley | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 2012| title = Anxiety and Decision-Making | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 113\u2013118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 | pmid = 22325982 | pmc = 3864559 }}</ref> Some studies show a link between anxious behaviour and risk (the chance that an outcome will have an unfavorable result).<ref>Jon Gertner.

Positive emotions, such as happiness, are believed to have more optimistic risk assessments and negative emotions, such as anger, have pessimistic risk assessments.  As an emotion with a negative valence, fear, and therefore anxiety, has long been associated with negative risk perceptions.  Under the more recent appraisal tendency framework of Jennifer Lerner et al., which refutes Forgas' notion of valence and promotes the idea that specific emotions have distinctive influences on judgments, fear is still related to pessimistic expectations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Jennifer S. | last2 = Keltner | first2 = Dacher | year = 2000 | title = Beyond Valence: Toward A Model of Emotion-Specific Influences on Judgment and Choice | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 473\u2013493 | doi=10.1080/026999300402763| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.6023 }}</ref>\n\nPsychologists have demonstrated that increases in anxiety and increases in [[risk perception]] are related and people who are habituated to anxiety experience this awareness of risk more intensely than normal individuals.<ref name=\"Jon\">Jon K.

Maner, J. Anthony Richey, Kiara Cromer, Mike Mallott, Carl W. Lejuez, Thomas E. Joiner, Norman B. Schmidt, Dispositional anxiety and risk-avoidant decision-making, Personality and Individual Differences, Volume 42, Issue 4, March 2007, pp. 665\u2013675, {{ISSN|0191-8869}}, 10.1016/j.paid.2006.08.016.</ref> For example, anxious individuals who are predisposed to generating reasons for negative results tend to exhibit pessimism.<ref name=\"Jon_a\" /> Also, findings suggest that the perception of a lack of control and a lower inclination to participate in risky decision-making (across various behavioural circumstances) is associated with individuals experiencing relatively high levels of trait anxiety.<ref name=\"Jon\" /> In the previous instance, there is supporting clinical research that links emotional evaluation (of control), the anxiety that is felt and the option of risk avoidance.<ref name=\"Jon\" />\n\nThere are various views presented that anxious/fearful emotions cause people to access involuntary responses and judgments when making decisions that involve risk.  Joshua A. Hemmerich et al. probes deeper into anxiety and its impact on choices by exploring \"risk-as-feelings\" which are quick, automatic, and natural reactions to danger that are based on emotions.  This notion is supported by an experiment that engages physicians in a simulated perilous surgical procedure.  It was demonstrated that a measurable amount of the participants' anxiety about patient outcomes was related to previous (experimentally created) regret and worry and ultimately caused the physicians to be led by their feelings over any information or guidelines provided during the mock surgery.  Additionally, their emotional levels, adjusted along with the simulated patient status, suggest that anxiety level and the respective decision made are correlated with the type of bad outcome that was experienced in the earlier part of the experiment.<ref>Joshua A. Hemmerich, Arthur S. Elstein, Margaret L. Schwarze, Elizabeth Ghini Moliski, William Dale, Risk as feelings in the effect of patient outcomes on physicians' future treatment decisions: A randomized trial and manipulation validation, Social Science &amp; Medicine, Volume 75, Issue 2, July 2012, pp. 367\u2013376, {{ISSN|0277-9536}}, 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.03.020.</ref> Similarly, another view of anxiety and decision-making is dispositional anxiety where emotional states, or [[mood (psychology)|moods]], are cognitive and provide information about future pitfalls and rewards (Maner and Schmidt, 2006).  When experiencing anxiety, individuals draw from personal judgments referred to as pessimistic outcome appraisals.  These emotions promote biases for risk avoidance and promote risk tolerance in decision-making.<ref name=\"Jon_a\" />\n\n===Dread risk===\nIt is common for people to dread some risks but not others: They tend to be very afraid of epidemic diseases, nuclear power plant failures, and plane accidents but are relatively unconcerned about some highly frequent and deadly events, such as traffic crashes, household accidents, and medical errors. One key distinction of dreadful risks seems to be their potential for catastrophic consequences,<ref name=\"Slovic P 1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Slovic | first1 = P | year = 1987 | title = Perception of risk | journal = Science | volume = 236 | issue = 4799 | pages = 280\u2013285 | doi=10.1126/science.3563507| pmid = 3563507 | bibcode = 1987Sci...236..280S }}</ref> threatening to kill a large number of people within a short period of time.<ref>Gigerenzer G (2004) Dread risk, 11 September, and fatal traffic accidents.

First, the psychometric paradigm<ref name=\"Slovic P 1987\"/> suggests that high lack of control, high catastrophic potential, and severe consequences account for the increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks. Second, because people estimate the frequency of a risk by recalling instances of its occurrence from their social circle or the media, they may overvalue relatively rare but dramatic risks because of their overpresence and undervalue frequent, less dramatic risks.<ref name=\"Lichtenstein S 1978\"/> Third, according to the preparedness hypothesis, people are prone to fear events that have been particularly threatening to survival in human evolutionary history.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = \u00d6hman | first1 = A | last2 = Mineka | first2 = S | year = 2001 | title = Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning | journal = Psychol Rev | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 483\u2013522 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.3.483| pmid = 11488376 }}</ref> Given that in most of human evolutionary history people lived in relatively small groups, rarely exceeding 100 people,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = KR | last2 = Walker | first2 = RS | last3 = Bozicevic | first3 = M | last4 = Eder | first4 = J | last5 = Headland | first5 = T |display-authors=etal  | year = 2011 | title = Co-residence patterns in hunter-gatherer societies show unique human social structure | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6022 | pages = 1286\u20131289 | doi=10.1126/science.1199071| pmid = 21393537 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331.1286H }}</ref> a dread risk, which kills many people at once, could potentially wipe out one's whole group.

Constans, 2001).  There is a chance that \"judgmental accuracy\" is correlated with heightened anxiety.  Constans conducted a study to examine how worry propensity (and current mood and trait anxiety) might influence college student's estimation of their performance on an upcoming exam, and the study found that worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias (errors in their risk assessments), even after variance attributable to current mood and trait anxiety had been removed.<ref name=\"Joseph\" /> Another experiment suggests that trait anxiety is associated with pessimistic risk appraisals (heightened perceptions of the probability and degree of suffering associated with a negative experience), while controlling for depression.<ref name=\"Jon\" />\n\n==Other considerations==\n===Risk and uncertainty===\nIn his seminal work ''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'', [[Frank Knight]] (1921) established the distinction between risk and uncertainty.\n{{quote|... Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. The term \"risk,\" as loosely used in everyday speech and in economic discussion, really covers two things which, functionally at least, in their causal relations to the phenomena of economic organization, are categorically different. ... The essential fact is that \"risk\" means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomenon depending on which of the two is really present and operating. ... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or \"risk\" proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We ... accordingly restrict the term \"uncertainty\" to cases of the non-quantitive type.:<ref>Frank Hyneman Knight \"Risk, uncertainty and profit\" pg. 19, Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Prize Essays, no. 31. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin. 1921.</ref>}}\n\nThus, [[Knightian uncertainty]] is immeasurable, not possible to calculate, while in the Knightian sense risk is measurable.\n\nAnother distinction between risk and uncertainty is proposed by Douglas Hubbard:<ref>Douglas Hubbard \"How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business\" pg. 46, John Wiley & Sons, 2007.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Douglas Hubbard \"The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It, John Wiley & Sons, 2009. Page 22 of https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1066599/files/37549842/download?verifier=ar2VjVOxCU8sEQr23I5LEBpr89B6fnwmoJgBinqj&wrap=1</ref>\n\n:'''Uncertainty''': The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. The \"true\" outcome/state/result/value is not known.\n:'''Measurement of uncertainty''': A set of probabilities assigned to a set of possibilities. Example: \"There is a 60% chance this market will double in five years\"\n:'''Risk''': A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.\n:'''Measurement of risk''': A set of possibilities each with quantified probabilities and quantified losses. Example: \"There is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs\".\n\nIn this sense, one may have uncertainty without risk but not risk without uncertainty. We can be uncertain about the winner of a contest, but unless we have some personal stake in it, we have no risk. If we bet money on the outcome of the contest, then we have a risk. In both cases there are more than one outcome. The measure of uncertainty refers only to the probabilities assigned to outcomes, while the measure of risk requires both probabilities for outcomes and losses quantified for outcomes.\n\n===Risk attitude, appetite and tolerance===\n{{Main|Risk aversion}}\n\nThe terms ''risk attitude'', ''appetite'', and ''tolerance'' are often used similarly to describe an organisation's or individual's attitude towards risk-taking. One's attitude may be described as ''risk-averse'', ''risk-neutral'', or ''risk-seeking''. Risk tolerance looks at acceptable/unacceptable deviations from what is expected.{{unclear inline|date=May 2017}} Risk appetite looks at how much risk one is willing to accept. There can still be deviations that are within a risk appetite. For example, recent research finds that insured individuals are significantly likely to divest from risky asset holdings in response to a decline in health, controlling for variables such as income, age, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.<ref>[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_23.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Health and the Savings of Insured versus Uninsured, Working-Age Households in the U.S.'', November 2009]</ref>\n\nGambling is a risk-increasing investment, wherein money on hand is risked for a possible large return, but with the possibility of losing it all. Purchasing a lottery ticket is a very risky investment with a high chance of no return and a small chance of a very high return. In contrast, putting money in a bank at a defined rate of interest is a risk-averse action that gives a guaranteed return of a small gain and precludes other investments with possibly higher gain.  The possibility of getting no return on an investment is also known as the [[rate of ruin]].\n\n===Risk as a vector quantity===\nHubbard also argues that defining risk as the product of impact and probability presumes, unrealistically, that decision-makers are [[risk-neutral]].<ref name = \"ReferenceA\"/> A risk-neutral person's utility is proportional to the [[expected value]] of the payoff. For example, a risk-neutral person would consider 20% chance of winning $1&nbsp;million exactly as desirable as getting a certain $200,000. However, most decision-makers are not actually risk-neutral and would not consider these equivalent choices. This gave rise to [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]]. Hubbard proposes to instead describe risk as a [[Vector space|vector]] quantity that distinguishes the probability and magnitude of a risk. Risks are simply described as a set or function{{vague|date=May 2017}} of possible payoffs (gains or losses) with their associated probabilities. This array is collapsed into a scalar value according to a decision-maker's [[risk aversion|risk tolerance]].\n\n== List of related books ==\n\nThis is a '''list of books about risk''' issues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

While including several other definitions, the OED 3rd edition defines ''risk'' as:\n\n<blockquote>(Exposure to) the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility.<ref>{{Cite OED|risk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== International Organization for Standardization ===\n\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) Guide 73 provides basic vocabulary to develop common understanding on risk management concepts and terms across different applications. ISO Guide 73:2009 defines risk as:\n \n<blockquote>effect of uncertainty on objectives\nNote 1: An effect is a deviation from the expected \u2013 positive or negative.\n\nNote 2: Objectives can have different aspects (such as financial, health and safety, and environmental goals) and can apply at different levels (such as strategic, organization-wide, project, product and process).\n\nNote 3: Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events and consequences or a combination of these.\n\nNote 4: Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an event (including changes in circumstances) and the associated likelihood of occurrence.\n\nNote 5: Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to, understanding or knowledge of, an event, its consequence, or likelihood.<ref name=\"ISOGuide73\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:guide:73:ed-1:v1:en|title=Guide 73:2009 Risk Management - Vocabulary|website=ISO}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis definition was developed by an international committee representing over 30 countries and is based on the input of several thousand subject matter experts. It was first adopted in 2002. Its complexity reflects the difficulty of satisfying fields that use the term risk in different ways. Some restrict the term to negative impacts (\u201cdownside risks\u201d), while others include positive impacts (\u201cupside risks\u201d). \n\n[[ISO 31000]]:2018 \u201cRisk management \u2014 Principles\u201d uses the same definition with a simpler set of notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:31000:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management - Guidelines|website=ISO}}</ref>\n\n=== Other ===\n\nMany other definitions of risk have been influential:\n\n:\u201cSource of harm\u201d. The earliest use of the word \u201crisk\u201d was as a synonym for the much older word \u201c[[hazard]]\u201d, meaning a potential source of harm.

For example:\n\n<blockquote>No definition is advanced as the correct one, because there is no one definition that is suitable for all problems. Rather, the choice of definition is a political one, expressing someone\u2019s views regarding the importance of different adverse effects in a particular situation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fischhoff |first1=B |last2=Watson |first2=S.R. |last3=Hope |first3=C. |title=Defining Risk |journal=Policy Sciences |date=1984 |issue=17 |pages=123-139}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Society for Risk Analysis]] concludes that \u201cexperience has shown that to agree on one unified set of definitions is not realistic\u201d. The solution is \u201cto allow for different perspectives on fundamental concepts and make a distinction between overall qualitative definitions and their associated measurements.\u201d<ref name=\"SRA2018\"/>\n\n==Practice areas==\nRisk is ubiquitous in all areas of life and [[risk management]] is something that we all must do, whether we are managing a major organisation or simply crossing the road.  When describing risk however, it is convenient to consider that risk practitioners operate in some specific practice areas.\n\n===Economic risk===\n\nEconomic risks can be manifested in lower incomes or higher expenditures than expected. The causes can be many, for instance, the hike in the price for raw materials, the lapsing of deadlines for construction of a new operating facility, disruptions in a production process, emergence of a serious competitor on the market, the loss of key personnel, the change of a political regime, or [[natural disasters]].\n\n===Health===\nRisks in personal health may be reduced by [[primary prevention]] actions that decrease early causes of illness or by [[secondary prevention]] actions after a person has clearly measured clinical signs or symptoms recognised as risk factors. Tertiary [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] reduces the negative impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion of [[risk factors]] with individual patients to obtain [[informed consent]] for secondary and tertiary prevention efforts, whereas public health efforts in primary prevention require education of the entire population at risk. In each case, careful communication about risk factors, likely outcomes and [[certainty]] must distinguish between causal events that must be decreased and associated events that may be merely consequences rather than causes.\n\nIn epidemiology, the '''lifetime risk''' of an effect is the ''[[cumulative incidence]]'', also called ''incidence proportion'' over an entire lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |vauthors=Rychetnik L, Hawe P, Waters E, Barratt A, Frommer M |date=July 2004 |volume=58 |pages=538\u201345 |doi=10.1136/jech.2003.011585 |pmid=15194712 |pmc=1732833 |title=A glossary for evidence based public health |issue=7 }}</ref>\n\n===Health, safety, and environment===\nIn terms of occupational health & safety management, the term 'risk' may be defined as the most likely consequence of a hazard, combined with the likelihood or probability of it occurring.\n\nHealth, safety, and environment (HSE) are separate practice areas; however, they are often linked. The reason for this is typically to do with organizational management structures; however, there are strong links among these disciplines. One of the strongest links between these is that a single risk event may have impacts in all three areas, albeit over differing timescales. For example, the uncontrolled release of radiation or a toxic chemical may have immediate short-term safety consequences, more protracted health impacts, and much longer-term [[environmental impact]]s. Events such as [[Chernobyl]], for example, caused immediate deaths, and in the longer term, deaths from cancers, and left a lasting environmental impact leading to [[birth defect]]s, impacts on wildlife, etc.\n\nOver time, a form of risk analysis called '''environmental risk analysis''' has developed. Environmental risk analysis is a field of study that attempts to understand events and activities that bring risk to human health or the environment.<ref name=\"Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries\">{{cite journal|last=Gurjar|first=Bhola Ram|author2=Mohan, Manju |title=Environmental Risk Analysis: Problems and Perspectives in Different Countries|journal=Risk: Health, Safety & Environment|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/risk13&id=5&collection=journals&index=journals/risk|accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHuman health and environmental risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome (See [[adverse outcome pathway]]). As such, risk is a function of hazard and exposure. Hazard is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed, e.g. the toxicity of a chemical compound. Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard. Therefore, the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero, given a person's (or other organism's) biological makeup, activities and location (See [[exposome]]).<ref>Vallero, Daniel A.

''Information assurance'' risks include the ones related to the consistency of the business information stored in IT systems and the information stored by other means and the relevant business consequences.\n\n===Insurance===\n[[Insurance]] is a risk treatment option which involves risk sharing. It can be considered as a form of contingent capital and is akin to purchasing an [[Option (finance)|option]] in which the buyer pays a small premium to be protected from a potential large loss.\n\nInsurance risk is often taken by insurance companies, who then bear a pool of risks including market risk, credit risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk, longevity risks, etc.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Elyasiani | first2 = Elyas | last3 = Mansur | first3 = Iqbal | year = 2008 | title = Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Interdependencies in Insurer Stock Returns: A System-GARCH Model | journal = The Journal of Risk and Insurance | volume = 75 | issue = 4| pages = 873\u2013891 | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6975.2008.00289.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.568.4087 }}</ref>\n\n===Business and management===\nMeans of assessing risk vary widely between professions. Indeed, they may define these professions; for example, a doctor manages medical risk, while a civil engineer manages risk of structural failure. A professional [[code of ethics]] is usually focused on risk assessment and mitigation (by the professional on behalf of client, public, society or life in general).\n\nIn the workplace, incidental and [[inherent risk]]s exist. Incidental risks are those that occur naturally in the business but are not part of the core of the business. Inherent risks have a negative effect on the operating profit of the business.\n\n===In human services===\nThe experience of many people who rely on human services for support is that 'risk' is often used as a reason to prevent them from gaining further independence or fully accessing the community, and that these services are often unnecessarily risk averse.<ref>A Positive Approach To Risk Requires Person Centred Thinking, Neill et al., Tizard Learning Disability Review http://pierprofessional.metapress.com/content/vr700311x66j0125/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"People's autonomy used to be compromised by institution walls, now it's too often our risk management practices\", according to [[John O'Brien (human services thinker)|John O'Brien]].<ref>John O'Brien cited in Sanderson, H.

Most studies of HROs involve areas such as nuclear aircraft carriers, air traffic control, aerospace and nuclear power stations. Organizations such as these share in common the ability to consistently operate safely in complex, interconnected environments where a single failure in one component could lead to catastrophe. Essentially, they are organisations which appear to operate 'in spite' of an enormous range of risks.\n\nSome of these industries manage risk in a highly quantified and enumerated way. These include the [[nuclear power]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aircraft industries]], where the possible failure of a complex series of engineered systems could result in highly undesirable outcomes. The usual measure of risk for a class of events is then: ''R'' = probability of the event \u00d7 the severity of the consequence.\n\nThe total risk is then the sum of the individual class-risks;  see below.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Safety, Reliability and Risk Analysis: Theory, Methods and Applications|last=Sebasti\u00e1n Martorell, Carlos Guedes Soares, Julie Barnett|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=9781482266481|location=|pages=671}}</ref>\n\nIn the nuclear industry, consequence is often measured in terms of off-site radiological release, and this is often banded into five or six-decade-wide bands.{{Clarify|reason=define \"decade-wide bands\":  factor of 10 regarding what?|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe risks are evaluated using fault tree/event tree techniques (see [[safety engineering]]). Where these risks are low, they are normally considered to be \"broadly acceptable\". A higher level of risk (typically up to 10 to 100 times what is considered broadly acceptable) has to be justified against the costs of reducing it further and the possible benefits that make it tolerable\u2014these risks are described as \"Tolerable if [[ALARP]]\", where ALARP stands for \"as low as reasonably practicable\". Risks beyond this level are classified as \"intolerable\".\n\nThe level of risk deemed broadly acceptable has been considered by regulatory bodies in various countries\u2014an early attempt by UK government regulator and academic [[F. R. Farmer]] used the example of hill-walking and similar activities, which have definable risks that people appear to find acceptable. This resulted in the so-called Farmer Curve of acceptable probability of an event versus its consequence.\n\nThe technique as a whole is usually referred to as probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) (or probabilistic safety assessment, PSA). See [[WASH-1400]] for an example of this approach.\n\n===Finance===\n{{Main|Financial risk}}\n\nIn finance, risk is the chance that the return achieved on an investment will be different from that expected, and also takes into account the size of the difference. This includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. In a view advocated by Damodaran, risk includes not only \"[[downside risk]]\" but also \"upside risk\" (returns that exceed expectations).<ref>{{cite book |title=Investment Philosophies: Successful Investment Philosophies and the Greatest Investors Who Made Them Work |first=Aswath |last=Damodaran |page=15 |publisher=Wiley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-471-34503-9}}</ref> Some regard the [[standard deviation]] of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment as providing some historical measure of risk; see modern portfolio theory. Financial risk may be market-dependent, determined by numerous market factors, or operational, resulting from fraudulent behaviour (e.g. [[Bernard Madoff]]).\n\nA fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return (see [[modern portfolio theory]]). The greater the potential return one might seek, the greater the risk that one generally assumes. A free market reflects this principle in the pricing of an instrument: strong demand for a safer instrument drives its price higher (and its return correspondingly lower) while weak demand for a riskier instrument drives its price lower (and its potential return thereby higher). For example, a US Treasury bond is considered to be one of the safest investments. In comparison to an investment or speculative grade corporate bond, US Treasury notes and bonds yield lower rates of return. The reason for this is that a corporation is more likely to default on debt than the US government. Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a correspondingly higher rate of return.\n\nA popular [[risk measure]] is [[Value-at-Risk]] (VaR).\n\nThere are different types of VaR: long term VaR, marginal VaR, factor VaR and shock VaR. The latter is used in measuring risk during the extreme market stress conditions.\n\nIn finance, ''risk'' has no single definition.\n\nArtzner et al.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Artzner | first1 = P. | last2 = Delbaen | first2 = F. | last3 = Eber | first3 = J.-M. | last4 = Heath | first4 = D. | year = 1999 | title = Coherent measures of risk | journal = Math.

Such an individual willingly pays a premium to assume risk (e.g. buys a lottery ticket).\n\n=== {{anchor|Risk in auditing}} Financial auditing ===\n{{Main|Audit risk}}\nThe [[audit risk|financial audit risk model]] expresses the risk of an [[auditor]] providing an inappropriate opinion (or material misstatement) of a commercial entity's financial statements. It can be analytically expressed as \n:<math> \\text{AR} = \\text{IR} \\times \\text{CR} \\times \\text{DR}</math>\nwhere AR is ''audit risk'', IR is ''[[Inherent risk (accounting)|inherent risk]]'', CR is ''control risk'' and DR is ''detection risk''.\n\nNote: As defined, audit risk does not consider the impact of an auditor misstatement and so is stated as a simple probability. The impact of misstatement must be considered when determining an acceptable audit risk.<ref>{{cite book|title = Risk Management and Corporate Governance: Interconnections in Law: Chapter: Risk Management from an accounting perspective | author = Arco van de Ven |pages = 16\u201317 |editors = Marijn van Daelen, Christoph van der Elst }}</ref>\n\n===Security===\n[[File:AT YOUR OWN RISK.svg|thumb|166px|'''AT YOUR OWN RISK'''<br />Popular labelling]]\nSecurity risk management involves protection of assets from harm caused by deliberate acts. A more detailed definition is: \"A security risk is any event that could result in the compromise of organizational assets i.e. the unauthorized use, loss, damage, disclosure or modification of organizational assets for the profit, personal interest or political interests of individuals, groups or other entities constitutes a compromise of the asset, and includes the risk of harm to people. Compromise of organizational assets may adversely affect the enterprise, its business units and their clients. As such, consideration of security risk is a vital component of risk management.\"<ref>Julian Talbot and Miles Jakeman ''Security Risk Management Body of Knowledge'', John Wiley & Sons, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Human factors===\n{{Main|Decision theory|Prospect theory}}\nOne of the growing areas of focus in risk management is the field of [[human factors]] where behavioural and organizational psychology underpin our understanding of risk based decision making. This field considers questions such as \"how do we make risk based decisions?\", \"why are we irrationally more scared of sharks and terrorists than we are of motor vehicles and medications?\"\n\nIn [[decision theory]], regret (and anticipation of regret) can play a significant part in decision-making, distinct from [[risk aversion]]<ref>Virine, L., & Trumper, M. ProjectThink. Gower. 2013</ref><ref>Virine, L., & Trumper, M. Project Risk Analysis Made Ridiculously Simple. World Scientific Publishing. 2017</ref>(preferring the status quo in case one becomes worse off).\n\n[[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]<ref>Amos Tversky / Daniel Kahneman, 1981. \"The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice.\"{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}</ref> is a fundamental problem with all forms of risk assessment. In particular, because of [[bounded rationality]] (our brains get overloaded, so we take mental shortcuts), the risk of extreme events is discounted because the probability is too low to evaluate intuitively. As an example, one of the leading causes of death is [[road accident]]s caused by [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] \u2013 partly because any given driver frames the problem by largely or totally ignoring the risk of a serious or fatal accident.\n\nFor instance, an extremely disturbing event (an attack by hijacking, or [[moral hazard]]s) may be ignored in analysis despite the fact it has occurred and has a nonzero probability. Or, an event that everyone agrees is inevitable may be ruled out of analysis due to greed or an unwillingness to admit that it is believed to be inevitable. These human tendencies for error and [[wishful thinking]] often affect even the most rigorous applications of the [[scientific method]] and are a major concern of the [[philosophy of science]].\n\nAll [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision-making under uncertainty]] must consider [[cognitive bias]], [[cultural bias]], and notational bias: No group of people assessing risk is immune to \"[[groupthink]]\": acceptance of obviously wrong answers simply because it is socially painful to disagree, where there are [[conflicts of interest]].\n\nFraming involves other information that affects the outcome of a risky decision.  The right prefrontal cortex has been shown to take a more global perspective<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schatz | first1 = J. | last2 = Craft | first2 = S. | last3 = Koby | first3 = M. | last4 = DeBaun | first4 = M.

Rightward tapping or listening had the effect of narrowing attention such that the frame was ignored.  This is a practical way of manipulating regional cortical activation to affect risky decisions, especially because directed tapping or listening is easily done.\n\n===Psychology of risk taking===\n\nA growing area of research has been to examine various psychological aspects of risk taking. Researchers typically run randomised experiments with a treatment and control group to ascertain the effect of different psychological factors that may be associated with risk taking. Thus, positive and negative feedback about past risk taking can affect future risk taking. In an experiment, people who were led to believe they are very competent at decision making saw more opportunities in a risky choice and took more risks, while those led to believe they were not very competent saw more threats and took fewer risks.<ref>Krueger, Norris, and Peter R. Dickson. \"How believing in ourselves increases risk taking: perceived self-efficacy and opportunity recognition.\" Decision Sciences 25, no. 3 (1994): 385\u2013400.</ref>\n\n===Maintenance===\nThe concept of risk-based maintenance is an advanced form of [[Reliability centred maintenance]]. In case of chemical industries, apart from probability of failure, consequences of failure is also very important. Therefore, the selection of maintenance policies should be based on risk, instead of reliability. Risk-based maintenance methodology acts as a tool for maintenance planning and decision making to reduce the probability of failure and its consequences. In risk-based maintenance decision making, the maintenance resources can be used optimally based on the risk class (high, medium, or low) of equipment or machines, to achieve tolerable risk criteria.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.069 | pmid=16887261 | volume=142 | issue=3 | title=Risk-based maintenance\u2014Techniques and applications | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials | pages=653\u2013661 | last1 = Arunraj | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Maiti | first2 = J.}}</ref>\n\n===Cybersecurity<ref>noun. The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this. 'But despite the number of agencies involved, cybersecurity generally seems to have slipped in importance for the administration</ref>===\nClosely related to information assurance and security risk, cybersecurity is the application of system security engineering<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2016/NIST-Releases-SP-800-160-Sys-Security-Engineering|title=NIST Releases SP 800-160, Systems Security Engineering|first=Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of|last=Commerce|date=15 November 2016|website=csrc.nist.gov}}</ref> in order to address the compromise of company cyber-assets required for business or mission purposes. In order to address cyber-risk, cybersecurity applies security to the supply chain, the design and production environment for a product or service, and the product itself in order to provide efficient and appropriate security commensurate with the value of the asset to the mission or business process.\n\n==Risk assessment and analysis==\n{{Main|Risk assessment|Operational risk management}}\nSince risk assessment and management is essential in security management, both are tightly related. Security assessment methodologies like [[CRAMM]] contain risk assessment modules as an important part of the first steps of the methodology. On the other hand, risk assessment methodologies like [[Mehari]] evolved to become security assessment methodologies. An [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard on risk management (Principles and guidelines on implementation) was published under code [[ISO 31000]] on 13 November 2009.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\nThere are many formal methods used to \"measure\" risk.\n\nOften the probability of a negative event is estimated by using the frequency of past similar events. Probabilities for rare failures may be difficult to estimate. This makes risk assessment difficult in hazardous industries, for example nuclear energy, where the frequency of failures is rare, while harmful consequences of failure are severe.\n\nStatistical methods may also require the use of a [[Loss function|cost function]], which in turn may require the calculation of the cost of loss of a human life. This is a difficult problem. One approach is to ask what people are willing to pay to insure against death<ref>{{Cite news|first = Steven|last = Landsburg|title = Is your life worth $10&nbsp;million?|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2079475/|work = Everyday Economics|publisher = Slate|date = 3 March 2003|accessdate = 17 March 2008}}</ref> or radiological release (e.g. GBq of radio-iodine), {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} but as the answers depend very strongly on the circumstances it is not clear that this approach is effective.\n\nRisk is often measured as the [[expected value]] of an undesirable outcome. This combines the probabilities of various possible events and some assessment of the corresponding harm into a single value. See also [[Expected utility]].  The simplest case is a binary possibility of ''Accident'' or ''No accident''. The associated formula for calculating risk is then:\n\n:<math> \\text{R} = (\\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \\times  (\\text{expected loss in case of the accident})</math>\n\nFor example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, then total risk is a loss of 10, the product of 0.01 and 1000.\n\nSituations are sometimes more complex than the simple binary possibility case. In a situation with several possible accidents, total risk is the sum of the risks for each different accident, provided that the outcomes are comparable:\n\n:<math> \\text{R} =  \\sum_\\text{For all accidents} (\\text{probability of the accident occurring}) \\times  (\\text{expected loss in case of the accident})</math>\n\nFor example, if performing activity ''X'' has a probability of 0.01 of suffering an accident of ''A'', with a loss of 1000, and a probability of 0.000001 of suffering an accident of type ''B'', with a loss of 2,000,000, then total loss expectancy is 12, which is equal to a loss of 10 from an accident of type ''A'' and 2 from an accident of type ''B''.\n\nOne of the first major uses of this concept was for the planning of the [[Delta Works]] in 1953, a flood protection program in the [[Netherlands]], with the aid of the mathematician [[David van Dantzig]].<ref>[[Wired Magazine]], [https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/17-01/ff_dutch_delta?currentPage=3 Before the levees break], page 3.</ref> The kind of risk analysis pioneered there has become common today in fields like nuclear power, [[aerospace]] and the [[chemical industry]].\n\nIn statistical decision theory, the [[risk function]] is defined as the expected value of a given [[loss function]] as a function of the [[decision rule]] used to make decisions in the face of uncertainty.\n\n===Fear as intuitive risk assessment===\nPeople may rely on their [[fear processing in the brain|fear]] and hesitation to keep them out of the most profoundly unknown circumstances. Fear is a response to perceived danger. Risk could be said to be the way we collectively measure and share this \"true fear\"\u2014a fusion of rational doubt, irrational fear, and a set of unquantified biases from our own experience.\n\nThe field of [[behavioural finance]] focuses on human risk-aversion, asymmetric regret, and other ways that human financial behaviour varies from what analysts call \"rational\". Risk in that case is the degree of [[uncertainty]] associated with a [[return (finance)|return]] on an asset.  Recognizing and respecting the irrational influences on human decision making may do much to reduce disasters caused by naive risk assessments that presume rationality but in fact merely fuse many shared biases.\n\n==Anxiety, risk and decision making==\n\n===Fear, anxiety and risk===\nAccording to one set of definitions, fear is a fleeting emotion ascribed to a particular object, while [[anxiety]] is a trait of fear (this is referring to \"trait anxiety\", as distinct from how the term \"anxiety\" is generally used) that lasts longer and is not attributed to a specific stimulus (these particular definitions are not used by all authors cited on this page).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartley | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 2012| title = Anxiety and Decision-Making | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 113\u2013118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.12.027 | pmid = 22325982 | pmc = 3864559 }}</ref> Some studies show a link between anxious behaviour and risk (the chance that an outcome will have an unfavorable result).<ref>Jon Gertner. What Are We Afraid Of, Money 32.5 (2003): 80.</ref> Joseph Forgas introduced [[valence (psychology)|valence]] based research where emotions are grouped as either positive or negative (Lerner and Keltner, 2000). Positive emotions, such as happiness, are believed to have more optimistic risk assessments and negative emotions, such as anger, have pessimistic risk assessments.  As an emotion with a negative valence, fear, and therefore anxiety, has long been associated with negative risk perceptions.  Under the more recent appraisal tendency framework of Jennifer Lerner et al., which refutes Forgas' notion of valence and promotes the idea that specific emotions have distinctive influences on judgments, fear is still related to pessimistic expectations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Jennifer S. | last2 = Keltner | first2 = Dacher | year = 2000 | title = Beyond Valence: Toward A Model of Emotion-Specific Influences on Judgment and Choice | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 473\u2013493 | doi=10.1080/026999300402763| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.6023 }}</ref>\n\nPsychologists have demonstrated that increases in anxiety and increases in [[risk perception]] are related and people who are habituated to anxiety experience this awareness of risk more intensely than normal individuals.<ref name=\"Jon\">Jon K.

Joshua A. Hemmerich et al. probes deeper into anxiety and its impact on choices by exploring \"risk-as-feelings\" which are quick, automatic, and natural reactions to danger that are based on emotions.  This notion is supported by an experiment that engages physicians in a simulated perilous surgical procedure.  It was demonstrated that a measurable amount of the participants' anxiety about patient outcomes was related to previous (experimentally created) regret and worry and ultimately caused the physicians to be led by their feelings over any information or guidelines provided during the mock surgery.  Additionally, their emotional levels, adjusted along with the simulated patient status, suggest that anxiety level and the respective decision made are correlated with the type of bad outcome that was experienced in the earlier part of the experiment.<ref>Joshua A. Hemmerich, Arthur S. Elstein, Margaret L. Schwarze, Elizabeth Ghini Moliski, William Dale, Risk as feelings in the effect of patient outcomes on physicians' future treatment decisions: A randomized trial and manipulation validation, Social Science &amp; Medicine, Volume 75, Issue 2, July 2012, pp. 367\u2013376, {{ISSN|0277-9536}}, 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.03.020.</ref> Similarly, another view of anxiety and decision-making is dispositional anxiety where emotional states, or [[mood (psychology)|moods]], are cognitive and provide information about future pitfalls and rewards (Maner and Schmidt, 2006).  When experiencing anxiety, individuals draw from personal judgments referred to as pessimistic outcome appraisals.  These emotions promote biases for risk avoidance and promote risk tolerance in decision-making.<ref name=\"Jon_a\" />\n\n===Dread risk===\nIt is common for people to dread some risks but not others: They tend to be very afraid of epidemic diseases, nuclear power plant failures, and plane accidents but are relatively unconcerned about some highly frequent and deadly events, such as traffic crashes, household accidents, and medical errors. One key distinction of dreadful risks seems to be their potential for catastrophic consequences,<ref name=\"Slovic P 1987\">{{cite journal | last1 = Slovic | first1 = P | year = 1987 | title = Perception of risk | journal = Science | volume = 236 | issue = 4799 | pages = 280\u2013285 | doi=10.1126/science.3563507| pmid = 3563507 | bibcode = 1987Sci...236..280S }}</ref> threatening to kill a large number of people within a short period of time.<ref>Gigerenzer G (2004) Dread risk, 11 September, and fatal traffic accidents.

First, the psychometric paradigm<ref name=\"Slovic P 1987\"/> suggests that high lack of control, high catastrophic potential, and severe consequences account for the increased risk perception and anxiety associated with dread risks. Second, because people estimate the frequency of a risk by recalling instances of its occurrence from their social circle or the media, they may overvalue relatively rare but dramatic risks because of their overpresence and undervalue frequent, less dramatic risks.<ref name=\"Lichtenstein S 1978\"/> Third, according to the preparedness hypothesis, people are prone to fear events that have been particularly threatening to survival in human evolutionary history.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = \u00d6hman | first1 = A | last2 = Mineka | first2 = S | year = 2001 | title = Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning | journal = Psychol Rev | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 483\u2013522 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.3.483| pmid = 11488376 }}</ref> Given that in most of human evolutionary history people lived in relatively small groups, rarely exceeding 100 people,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = KR | last2 = Walker | first2 = RS | last3 = Bozicevic | first3 = M | last4 = Eder | first4 = J | last5 = Headland | first5 = T |display-authors=etal  | year = 2011 | title = Co-residence patterns in hunter-gatherer societies show unique human social structure | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6022 | pages = 1286\u20131289 | doi=10.1126/science.1199071| pmid = 21393537 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331.1286H }}</ref> a dread risk, which kills many people at once, could potentially wipe out one's whole group.

Constans, 2001).  There is a chance that \"judgmental accuracy\" is correlated with heightened anxiety.  Constans conducted a study to examine how worry propensity (and current mood and trait anxiety) might influence college student's estimation of their performance on an upcoming exam, and the study found that worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias (errors in their risk assessments), even after variance attributable to current mood and trait anxiety had been removed.<ref name=\"Joseph\" /> Another experiment suggests that trait anxiety is associated with pessimistic risk appraisals (heightened perceptions of the probability and degree of suffering associated with a negative experience), while controlling for depression.<ref name=\"Jon\" />\n\n==Other considerations==\n===Risk and uncertainty===\nIn his seminal work ''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'', [[Frank Knight]] (1921) established the distinction between risk and uncertainty.\n{{quote|... Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of Risk, from which it has never been properly separated. The term \"risk,\" as loosely used in everyday speech and in economic discussion, really covers two things which, functionally at least, in their causal relations to the phenomena of economic organization, are categorically different. ... The essential fact is that \"risk\" means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomenon depending on which of the two is really present and operating. ... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or \"risk\" proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We ... accordingly restrict the term \"uncertainty\" to cases of the non-quantitive type.:<ref>Frank Hyneman Knight \"Risk, uncertainty and profit\" pg. 19, Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Prize Essays, no. 31.

The \"true\" outcome/state/result/value is not known.\n:'''Measurement of uncertainty''': A set of probabilities assigned to a set of possibilities. Example: \"There is a 60% chance this market will double in five years\"\n:'''Risk''': A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.\n:'''Measurement of risk''': A set of possibilities each with quantified probabilities and quantified losses. Example: \"There is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs\".\n\nIn this sense, one may have uncertainty without risk but not risk without uncertainty. We can be uncertain about the winner of a contest, but unless we have some personal stake in it, we have no risk. If we bet money on the outcome of the contest, then we have a risk. In both cases there are more than one outcome. The measure of uncertainty refers only to the probabilities assigned to outcomes, while the measure of risk requires both probabilities for outcomes and losses quantified for outcomes.\n\n===Risk attitude, appetite and tolerance===\n{{Main|Risk aversion}}\n\nThe terms ''risk attitude'', ''appetite'', and ''tolerance'' are often used similarly to describe an organisation's or individual's attitude towards risk-taking. One's attitude may be described as ''risk-averse'', ''risk-neutral'', or ''risk-seeking''. Risk tolerance looks at acceptable/unacceptable deviations from what is expected.{{unclear inline|date=May 2017}} Risk appetite looks at how much risk one is willing to accept. There can still be deviations that are within a risk appetite. For example, recent research finds that insured individuals are significantly likely to divest from risky asset holdings in response to a decline in health, controlling for variables such as income, age, and out-of-pocket medical expenses.<ref>[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2009/wp2009_23.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''Health and the Savings of Insured versus Uninsured, Working-Age Households in the U.S.'', November 2009]</ref>\n\nGambling is a risk-increasing investment, wherein money on hand is risked for a possible large return, but with the possibility of losing it all. Purchasing a lottery ticket is a very risky investment with a high chance of no return and a small chance of a very high return. In contrast, putting money in a bank at a defined rate of interest is a risk-averse action that gives a guaranteed return of a small gain and precludes other investments with possibly higher gain.  The possibility of getting no return on an investment is also known as the [[rate of ruin]].\n\n===Risk as a vector quantity===\nHubbard also argues that defining risk as the product of impact and probability presumes, unrealistically, that decision-makers are [[risk-neutral]].<ref name = \"ReferenceA\"/> A risk-neutral person's utility is proportional to the [[expected value]] of the payoff. For example, a risk-neutral person would consider 20% chance of winning $1&nbsp;million exactly as desirable as getting a certain $200,000. However, most decision-makers are not actually risk-neutral and would not consider these equivalent choices. This gave rise to [[prospect theory]] and [[cumulative prospect theory]]. Hubbard proposes to instead describe risk as a [[Vector space|vector]] quantity that distinguishes the probability and magnitude of a risk. Risks are simply described as a set or function{{vague|date=May 2017}} of possible payoffs (gains or losses) with their associated probabilities. This array is collapsed into a scalar value according to a decision-maker's [[risk aversion|risk tolerance]].\n\n== List of related books ==\n\nThis is a '''list of books about risk''' issues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses. Most people are in the standard category.\n\nPeople in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to the higher mortality.

If the insured's death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.\n\nPayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]], which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or [[Life annuity|for the beneficiary's lifetime]].<ref name=\"OECD2016\">{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Life Annuity Products and Their Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|date=5 December 2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-26531-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance vs assurance===\nThe specific uses of the terms \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201cassurance\u201d are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario.

A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses.

In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance for the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via [[hit-and-run]] vehicular homicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Elderly Women Indicted on Fraud Charges in Deaths of LA Hit-Run |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095818/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRecently, [[viatical settlement]]s have created problems for life insurance providers. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.
