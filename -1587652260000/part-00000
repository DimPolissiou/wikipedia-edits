The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations. The [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]] tram services to the [[Glattal]] area to the north of the city interwork with the city tram services and are also operated by the VBZ, although in this case it does so as a sub-contractor to the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] (VBG).

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]].

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

Most, but not all, tram stops are configured to allow passengers in [[wheelchair]]s to board low-floor trams.<ref name=gpw/>\n\nOf the three routes that operate in part over Glattalbahn tracks, routes 10 and 12 are operated by the VBZ on behalf of the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] (VBG), normally using tramcars in the VBG's own predominantly white colour scheme, whilst route 11 is operated by the VBZ on its own behalf, normally using vehicles in its own livery.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr/>\n\nThe independent [[Forchbahn]] (FB) railway uses VBZ trackwork to reach their city centre terminus, at [[Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen railway station|Bahnhof Stadelhofen]], from the eastern edge of the city, at Rehalp. The FB trains operate largely in the street for this section of their route, sharing track with VBZ tram routes, but are categorised as route [[S18 (ZVV)|S18]] of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn railway network]] rather than as part of the tram network. Beyond Rehalp the trains use the FB's own segregated tracks to reach their outer terminus at [[Esslingen, Switzerland|Esslingen]].<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/>\n\nOn the last weekend of each month, the [[Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum]] operates tram route 21 from the city centre to the museum at Burgwies (up to Rehalp at Saturdays), using their own heritage rolling stock.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tram-museum.ch/content.php?id=5&lang=en | title = The Museum Line 21 | publisher = Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum | accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Stadelhoferplatz IMG 4441.JPG|thumb|Raised platforms for use with low-floor trams, being used by a high-floor tram]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram network is built to [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge). There are {{convert|171.9|km|mi}} of track, equating to a network length of {{convert|72.9|km|mi}} and a total route length of {{convert|118.7|km|mi}}. The tracks are electrified using [[overhead line]] at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], utilising a supply system shared with the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus network]].<ref name=\"figures\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/die_vbz/portraet/zahlen_fakten/linien.html |title=Startseite VBZ - Die VBZ - Portr\u00e4t - Zahlen & Fakten - Linien |publisher=Stadt Z\u00fcrich [City of Z\u00fcrich] |language=German |trans-title=Home VBZ - VBZ - Portrait - Facts & Figures - Lines |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nThe VBZ infrastructure within Z\u00fcrich is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic and significant sections where trams run in unrestricted traffic lanes. In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.<ref name=gpw>{{cite web | title = Gleisplan - Stra\u00dfenbahn Z\u00fcrich mit Glattal |  url = http://www.gleisplanweb.eu/Maps/Zuerich.pdf | language = German | trans-title = Trackplan - Z\u00fcrich with Glattal | date = 2014-01-23 | accessdate = 2014-06-21}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nMany of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided. In consequence all terminal locations are equipped with [[turning loop]]s, and all tram stops are to the [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]] of the tram.<ref name=gpw/>\n\n===Depots and workshops===\n[[File:Tramdepot Zuerich 1911 Friedrich Fissler.jpg|thumb|left|The tram depot at Hard was built in 1911]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram fleet is kept in the five operational depots of Hard, Irchel, Kalkbreite, Oerlikon and  Wollishofen, together with a permanent way yard at Hardturm. Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten.

Burgweis depot now houses the [[Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich]] main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.<ref name=gpw/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Tram fleet===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

A test run was held at the Coliseum. The images were terrific. However, during its last test, it sped very fast low to the ground and the entire length of the field. One of its four support wires snagged on the top of the steel football goal post at the Peristyle end of the Coliseum and bent one of the arms. Skycam was unharmed, but was not used at the Olympics that year.\n\nSystems from Skycam and CableCam have also been used for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] final series and the beginning of the 2005 and 2006 [[NASCAR]] season broadcast on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. CableCam was used on the famous 17th hole at the [[TPC at Sawgrass]] for [[NBC]]'s coverage of [[The Players Championship]] in 2005.  [[CBS]] used a SkyCam for their coverage of the [[2010 in sports|2010]] [[NCAA]] [[Men's basketball|Men's]] [[College basketball|Basketball]] [[Final Four]] games in [[Lucas Oil Stadium]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the [[Nine Network]] trialed Skycam for three of their ''[[Friday Night Football (Australia)|Friday Night Football]]'' broadcasts of the [[Australian Football League]] for the [[2004 AFL season|2004 season]]. It was also used in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] series.\n\nThe first use of Skycam for an MLS broadcast was on April 2, 2005 for an ESPN broadcast of a match between DC United and Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California.<ref name=\"Skycam MLS debut\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2010/01/22/abc-espn2-unveil-broadcast-team-enhancements-2005|title=ABC, ESPN2 unveil broadcast team, enhancements for 2005|accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref> However, the use of Skycam soon proved to be controversial a few weeks later on April 23, 2005 when the camera crashed to the field  of the Home Depot Center during a match between the LA Galaxy and Chivas USA.<ref name=\"MLS News - End of Skycam?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600129226/Adu-continues-to-prove-he-deserves-more-minutes.html|title=MSL notes: Adu continues to prove he deserves more minutes|accessdate=2016-06-22|work=Deseret News}}</ref>\n\nSkycam has been used infrequently for MLS broadcasts since then, including the [[2015 MLS All-Star Game]].

Each reel is a cable spool with {{convert|4.5|hp}} motor and disc brakes with its own computer capable of a .01\" positioning resolution. The cable is a braided [[Kevlar]] jacketed single mode [[optical fiber]] with conductive copper elements and is capable of supporting {{convert|600|lb|kg|-1}} on a single cable.\n\n===Mobile spar===\nThe {{convert|36|in|cm|0|adj=on}} tall spar contains the [[Sony]] [[High-definition television|HD]] camera, the pan and tilt motor, and stabilization sensors. Weighing {{convert|45|lb|kg|0}}, the package also includes a power distribution module and electronics for fiber optic signaling.\n\n===Central control===\nCentral control is an industrial grade, Linux computer workstation that provides camera flight and video control. Both a pilot (the one who flies the spar in 3D space) and the operator (the one who controls the camera pan, tilt, zoom and focus) use this system for controlling the overall video shot. The central computer system uses a custom software package to control each aspect of the camera system, including motion, video, and obstacle avoidance.\n\n==Incidents==\n* In the December 20, 2009 [[2009 Las Vegas Bowl|Las Vegas Bowl]] between the [[Oregon State Beavers]] and the [[BYU Cougars]], Skycam had to be taken down as a result of high winds. Gusts were reported at over 40 miles per hour.\n* In the [[2011 Insight Bowl]] on December 30, 2011 between the [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] and the [[Oklahoma Sooners]], Skycam crashed onto the field with 2:22 left to play, almost striking Iowa receiver [[Marvin McNutt]]. The game was delayed for about 5 minutes as a result, as the camera and its cables were removed from the field of play.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/sports/article/No-one-hurt-after-camera-falls-at-Insight-Bowl-2434267.php \"No one hurt after camera falls at Insight Bowl\"] ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (December 31, 2011){{}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spidercam]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Gwinn, Eric (November 11, 2004).

The network has regularly offered a skycam-only Internet broadcast of many of its more important sportscasts under the [[Megacast]] brand.\n\n[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] used a CableCam in their broadcasts of the [[2005 Grey Cup|2005]] and [[2006 Grey Cup]]s.<ref name=\"CFL.ca 2006-11-17\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=newser&func=display&topicnum=&nid=13747|title=CBC will be stringing viewers along|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=CFL.ca|date=2005-08-08}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, NBC was required to broadcast the majority of a ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' game using Skycam angles, as their traditional sideline angles were obscured by a large amount of fog.

A test run was held at the Coliseum. The images were terrific. However, during its last test, it sped very fast low to the ground and the entire length of the field. One of its four support wires snagged on the top of the steel football goal post at the Peristyle end of the Coliseum and bent one of the arms. Skycam was unharmed, but was not used at the Olympics that year.\n\nSystems from Skycam and CableCam have also been used for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] final series and the beginning of the 2005 and 2006 [[NASCAR]] season broadcast on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. CableCam was used on the famous 17th hole at the [[TPC at Sawgrass]] for [[NBC]]'s coverage of [[The Players Championship]] in 2005.  [[CBS]] used a SkyCam for their coverage of the [[2010 in sports|2010]] [[NCAA]] [[Men's basketball|Men's]] [[College basketball|Basketball]] [[Final Four]] games in [[Lucas Oil Stadium]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the [[Nine Network]] trialed Skycam for three of their ''[[Friday Night Football (Australia)|Friday Night Football]]'' broadcasts of the [[Australian Football League]] for the [[2004 AFL season|2004 season]]. It was also used in the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] series.\n\nThe first use of Skycam for an MLS broadcast was on April 2, 2005 for an ESPN broadcast of a match between DC United and Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California.<ref name=\"Skycam MLS debut\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2010/01/22/abc-espn2-unveil-broadcast-team-enhancements-2005|title=ABC, ESPN2 unveil broadcast team, enhancements for 2005|accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref> However, the use of Skycam soon proved to be controversial a few weeks later on April 23, 2005 when the camera crashed to the field  of the Home Depot Center during a match between the LA Galaxy and Chivas USA.<ref name=\"MLS News - End of Skycam?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600129226/Adu-continues-to-prove-he-deserves-more-minutes.html|title=MSL notes: Adu continues to prove he deserves more minutes|accessdate=2016-06-22|work=Deseret News}}</ref>\n\nSkycam has been used infrequently for MLS broadcasts since then, including the [[2015 MLS All-Star Game]]. On April 2, 2016, [[Sporting Kansas City]] debuted the league's first semi-permanent Skycam installation at [[Children's Mercy Park]], in a match against [[Real Salt Lake]].<ref name=\"Star-Skycam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mls/sporting-kc/article65480802.html|title=Sporting KC telecasts will soon show soccer in a new way|work=The Kansas City Star|first=Sam|last=McDowell}}</ref>\n\n==Technical overview==\nSkycam consists of three major components: the reel\u2014the motor drive and cables, the spar\u2014the counterbalanced [[Panning (camera)|pan]] and [[tilt (camera)|tilt]] video camera, and central control\u2014the computer software used by the operator to fly the camera.\n\n===Reels===\nThe system consists of four reels anchored at high fixed points at corners of the stadium or arena (the cables are attached to fixed spars formed by tall extensible lift platforms when permanent anchors are not available). Each reel is a cable spool with {{convert|4.5|hp}} motor and disc brakes with its own computer capable of a .01\" positioning resolution. The cable is a braided [[Kevlar]] jacketed single mode [[optical fiber]] with conductive copper elements and is capable of supporting {{convert|600|lb|kg|-1}} on a single cable.\n\n===Mobile spar===\nThe {{convert|36|in|cm|0|adj=on}} tall spar contains the [[Sony]] [[High-definition television|HD]] camera, the pan and tilt motor, and stabilization sensors. Weighing {{convert|45|lb|kg|0}}, the package also includes a power distribution module and electronics for fiber optic signaling.\n\n===Central control===\nCentral control is an industrial grade, Linux computer workstation that provides camera flight and video control. Both a pilot (the one who flies the spar in 3D space) and the operator (the one who controls the camera pan, tilt, zoom and focus) use this system for controlling the overall video shot. The central computer system uses a custom software package to control each aspect of the camera system, including motion, video, and obstacle avoidance.\n\n==Incidents==\n* In the December 20, 2009 [[2009 Las Vegas Bowl|Las Vegas Bowl]] between the [[Oregon State Beavers]] and the [[BYU Cougars]], Skycam had to be taken down as a result of high winds. Gusts were reported at over 40 miles per hour.\n* In the [[2011 Insight Bowl]] on December 30, 2011 between the [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] and the [[Oklahoma Sooners]], Skycam crashed onto the field with 2:22 left to play, almost striking Iowa receiver [[Marvin McNutt]]. The game was delayed for about 5 minutes as a result, as the camera and its cables were removed from the field of play.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/sports/article/No-one-hurt-after-camera-falls-at-Insight-Bowl-2434267.php \"No one hurt after camera falls at Insight Bowl\"] ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (December 31, 2011){{}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spidercam]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Gwinn, Eric (November 11, 2004).

It occupies most of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] in the northeast region of the country, on the Caribbean Sea and bordering [[Venezuela]], at the northernmost tip of South America. The capital city of the department is [[Riohacha]].\n\nVarious indigenous tribes populated the arid plains of the region long before the Spanish expeditions reached the Americas. In 1498, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] sailed around the peninsula of La Guajira, but the first European to set foot in what is known today as La Guajira was the Spanish explorer [[Juan de la Cosa]] in 1499. During the colonial era, the territory of La Guajira was disputed by the governors of [[Santa Marta]] and Venezuela, owing to deposits of pearls. English pirates, Frenchmen, and Germans also fought for control of the territory. \n\n[[Martin Fernandez de Enciso]] founded [[Cabo de la Vela|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela]], the first colonial village in the territory. In 1535, [[Nikolaus Federmann|Nicol\u00e1s de Federm\u00e1n]] refounded the settlement as the village of Riohacha, as a result of constant attacks by the [[Wayuu people]]. In 1544, it was moved to the site of the present-day city. In 1871, the region was separated from the Department of Magdalena, and La Guajira became a national territory in its own right. The Intendance of La Guajira was created in 1898.<ref name=\"Colombian Air Force: Guajira\">[http://www.fac.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=11564&facmil_2007=fe2958d2bfc1a59 Colombian Air Force: Guajira]</ref>\n\nIn 1911, the Colombian government created the Commissary of la Guajira. In the 1930s, numerous immigrants came to the area from the Middle East ([[Christian Arabs|Christians]] and [[Maronites]]) from Lebanon, Syria, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Jordan, and countries under the Ottoman Empire. They generally settled in  the city of [[Maicao]]. In 1954, the Intendance of la Guajira was created again and Riohacha was declared a municipality. Finally, in 1964, the Department of La Guajira was created.<ref name=\"Colombian Air Force: Guajira\"/>\n\nThe economy of the department depends on royalties from the [[coal]] mining at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] (producing 24.9 million tons of export coal in 2004), [[natural gas]] exploitation, and salt mines. A popular ecotourist destination is [[Cabo de la Vela]], a small fishing village located on the headland of the peninsula in the [[La Guajira Desert|Guajira desert]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Guajira'' comes from the [[Cariban languages]]. According to Picon, the word ''Guajiros'' was first used in the year 1600 to designate some 200 indigenous families inhabiting the region of Riohacha.<ref>Picon, Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9. 1996: p. 313</ref> They were known for having large herds of goats. The Spanish applied the term to all the indigenous in the peninsula who were goat herders. According to Oliver, the term ''Guajiro'' did not appear on Spanish records until the year 1626, in a document by a friar named Pedro Sim\u00f3n.<ref>Oliver, Jos\u00e9. ''Reflexiones sobre los posibles or\u00edgenes del Wayuu (Guajiro)'', 1990: p. 84</ref><ref>[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf {{in lang|es}} Government of La Guajira: Guajira Development Plan - Etymology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529031022/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/archivospdf/plandesarrollo.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{See also|Geography of Colombia}}\n\n[[File:Guajirapeninsula1.png|thumb|left|200px|The Guajira peninsula]]\n\nThe northern part of the department consists of arid plains called the [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]], whose dryness is caused by the rain shadow of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. These mountains rise to {{convert|5,775|m|ft}} in the south. The [[Sin\u00fa Valley dry forests]] lie in between. In the far south are the headwaters of the [[Cesar River]], which flow south towards the [[Magdalena River]].<ref name=\"ocaribe.org\">[http://www.ocaribe.org/downloads/grupos/economia_competitividad/estudio_zif_guajira_venezuela.pdf {{in lang|es}} Observatorio del Caribe Colombiano: Grupo Regional de investigaci\u00f3n en econom\u00eda y competitividad en el Caribe colombiano by Weildler Guerra, Paola Quintero, Jorge Quintero and Ana Mar\u00eda Maldonado]</ref>\n\nThe [[Rancher\u00eda River]], which also rises in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, crosses the [[Guajira Peninsula]] from south to north and flows through the Valley of Upar and into the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The [[Serran\u00eda del Perij\u00e1]] and the [[Montes de Oca (Colombia)|Montes de Oca]] lie in the southeastern part of the department, bordering Venezuela.<ref name=\"ocaribe.org\"/>\n\nThe department was divided into three subregions based on geographical characteristics: Upper, Middle, and Southern Guajira. The Upper Guajira covers the northernmost part of the peninsula, with mostly scarce semi-[[desert]]ic vegetation. It has only an isolated, low-altitude mountain range, the [[Serran\u00eda de Macuira]] (865 m above sea level).

There were rebellions in 1701 (when the Wayuu destroyed a Capuchin mission), 1727 (when more than 2,000 Indians attacked the Spanish), 1741, 1757, 1761, and 1768. In 1718, Governor Soto de Herrera called the Wayuu, \"barbarians, horse thieves, worthy of death, without God, without law and without a king\". Of all the Indians in the territory of Colombia, they were unique in having learned the use of firearms and horses.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\">[http://www.banrep.gov.co/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio1990/junio2.htm {{in lang|es}} Luis Angel Arango Library: The Guajira rebellion]</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Mess\u00eda de la Cerda2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pedro Mess\u00eda de la Cerda]], Viceroy of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].]]\n\nIn 1769, the Spanish took 22 Wayuu captive, in order to put them to work building the fortifications of Cartagena. The reaction of their fellow Indians was unexpected. On May 2, 1769, at El Rinc\u00f3n, near [[Riohacha|R\u00edo de la Hacha]], they set the village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it, and capturing the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rinc\u00f3n to capture the Indians. At the head of this force was Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/>\n\nThis success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at its peak there were 20,000 Indians under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. These enabled the rebels to capture nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards who could took refuge in R\u00edo de la Hacha and sent urgent messages to [[Maracaibo]], Valle de Upar, Santa Marta, and Cartagena. Cartagena sent 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death, a battle between them being fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements quelled the rebellion, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/>\n\n===Republican era===\nIn 1846, the new government of the [[Republic of New Granada]] created the \"Guajiro territory\", from part of the State of Magdalena, but the indigenous traded in contraband on a large scale, problems with the authorities continued, and the territory was once again put under the government of Santa Marta.<ref name=\"universia.net.co\"/>\n\nIn 1871, once again the territory of La Guajira was put under separate administration and became a national territory.

The San Antonio Orphanage, located by the [[Calancala River]], was built in 1910, and the Nazareth Orphanage, in the Serran\u00eda de Macuira mountains, in 1913. The orphanages had influence over the [[rancher\u00eda]]s of Guarrachal, El P\u00e1jaro, Caraz\u00faa, Guaraguao, Murumana, Garra Patamana, and Karraip\u00eda. The Nazareth Orphanage had some control over the rancher\u00edas of Taroa, Maguaipa, Guaseip\u00e1, and Alpanapause. The friars frequently visited the settlements, inviting the people to attend mass. Wayuu children in the orphanages were educated in traditional European customs. Conflicts between the Wayuu people and the Colombian government have decreased since then.

It occupies most of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] in the northeast region of the country, on the Caribbean Sea and bordering [[Venezuela]], at the northernmost tip of South America. The capital city of the department is [[Riohacha]].\n\nVarious indigenous tribes populated the arid plains of the region long before the Spanish expeditions reached the Americas. In 1498, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] sailed around the peninsula of La Guajira, but the first man to set foot in what is known today as La Guajira was the Spanish explorer [[Juan de la Cosa]] in 1499. During the colonial era, the territory of La Guajira was disputed by the governors of [[Santa Marta]] and Venezuela, owing to deposits of pearls. English pirates, Frenchmen, and Germans also fought for control of the territory. \n\n[[Martin Fernandez de Enciso]] founded [[Cabo de la Vela|Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela]], the first colonial village in the territory. In 1535, [[Nikolaus Federmann|Nicol\u00e1s de Federm\u00e1n]] refounded the settlement as the village of Riohacha, as a result of constant attacks by the [[Wayuu people]]. In 1544, it was moved to the site of the present-day city. In 1871, the region was separated from the Department of Magdalena, and La Guajira became a national territory in its own right. The Intendance of La Guajira was created in 1898.<ref name=\"Colombian Air Force: Guajira\">[http://www.fac.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=11564&facmil_2007=fe2958d2bfc1a59 Colombian Air Force: Guajira]</ref>\n\nIn 1911, the Colombian government created the Commissary of la Guajira. In the 1930s, numerous immigrants came to the area from the Middle East ([[Christian Arabs|Christians]] and [[Maronites]]) from Lebanon, Syria, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Jordan, and countries under the Ottoman Empire. They generally settled in  the city of [[Maicao]]. In 1954, the Intendance of la Guajira was created again and Riohacha was declared a municipality. Finally, in 1964, the Department of La Guajira was created.<ref name=\"Colombian Air Force: Guajira\"/>\n\nThe economy of the department depends on royalties from the [[coal]] mining at [[Cerrej\u00f3n]] (producing 24.9 million tons of export coal in 2004), [[natural gas]] exploitation, and salt mines. A popular ecotourist destination is [[Cabo de la Vela]], a small fishing village located on the headland of the peninsula in the [[La Guajira Desert|Guajira desert]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Guajira'' comes from the [[Cariban languages]]. According to Picon, the word ''Guajiros'' was first used in the year 1600 to designate some 200 indigenous families inhabiting the region of Riohacha.<ref>Picon, Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9. 1996: p. 313</ref> They were known for having large herds of goats. The Spanish applied the term to all the indigenous in the peninsula who were goat herders. According to Oliver, the term ''Guajiro'' did not appear on Spanish records until the year 1626, in a document by a friar named Pedro Sim\u00f3n.<ref>Oliver, Jos\u00e9.

There were rebellions in 1701 (when the Wayuu destroyed a Capuchin mission), 1727 (when more than 2,000 Indians attacked the Spanish), 1741, 1757, 1761, and 1768. In 1718, Governor Soto de Herrera called the Wayuu, \"barbarians, horse thieves, worthy of death, without God, without law and without a king\". Of all the Indians in the territory of Colombia, they were unique in having learned the use of firearms and horses.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\">[http://www.banrep.gov.co/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio1990/junio2.htm {{in lang|es}} Luis Angel Arango Library: The Guajira rebellion]</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Mess\u00eda de la Cerda2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Pedro Mess\u00eda de la Cerda]], Viceroy of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].]]\n\nIn 1769, the Spanish took 22 Wayuu captive, in order to put them to work building the fortifications of Cartagena. The reaction of their fellow Indians was unexpected. On May 2, 1769, at El Rinc\u00f3n, near [[Riohacha|R\u00edo de la Hacha]], they set the village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it, and capturing the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rinc\u00f3n to capture the Indians. At the head of this force was Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/>\n\nThis success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at its peak there were 20,000 Indians under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. These enabled the rebels to capture nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards who could took refuge in R\u00edo de la Hacha and sent urgent messages to [[Maracaibo]], Valle de Upar, Santa Marta, and Cartagena. Cartagena sent 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death, a battle between them being fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements quelled the rebellion, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory.<ref name=\"banrep.gov.co\"/>\n\n===Republican era===\nIn 1846, the new government of the [[Republic of New Granada]] created the \"Guajiro territory\", from part of the State of Magdalena, but the indigenous traded in contraband on a large scale, problems with the authorities continued, and the territory was once again put under the government of Santa Marta.<ref name=\"universia.net.co\"/>\n\nIn 1871, once again the territory of La Guajira was put under separate administration and became a national territory.

The San Antonio Orphanage, located by the [[Calancala River]], was built in 1910, and the Nazareth Orphanage, in the Serran\u00eda de Macuira mountains, in 1913. The orphanages had influence over the [[rancher\u00eda]]s of Guarrachal, El P\u00e1jaro, Caraz\u00faa, Guaraguao, Murumana, Garra Patamana, and Karraip\u00eda. The Nazareth Orphanage had some control over the rancher\u00edas of Taroa, Maguaipa, Guaseip\u00e1, and Alpanapause. The friars frequently visited the settlements, inviting the people to attend mass. Wayuu children in the orphanages were educated in traditional European customs. Conflicts between the Wayuu people and the Colombian government have decreased since then.
