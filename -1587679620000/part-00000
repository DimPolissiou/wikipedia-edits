First, it promotes the release of [[free fatty acid]]s (FFAs) from [[adipose tissue]] into the blood. Typically, adipose tissue stores lipids in the form of [[triglyceride]]s, slowly releasing them into the bloodstream when insulin is low. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, such as in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, more triglycerides are [[lipolysis|broken down]] into FFAs and released into the bloodstream, promoting uptake by the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Second, insulin promotes the production of new FFAs in the liver via [[Lipogenesis|''de novo'' lipogenesis]]; this production of liver fats continues to be stimulated by insulin, even when other tissues are insulin-resistant.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These FFAs are combined back into triglycerides in the liver, forming the major constituent of the accumulated fat in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> The three sources of free fatty acids that contribute to liver triglyceride accumulation include FFAs circulating in the bloodstream (59%), FFAs derived from carbohydrates such as fructose and glucose (26%), and diet (14%).<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Despite the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, they are not directly toxic to liver tissue.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Instead, alteration of the profile of the other lipid subtypes present in the liver, such as [[diacylglycerol]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[ceramide]]s, and free [[cholesterol]], have a more significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>  \n\nOnce NAFLD progresses in severity to the point of NASH, this promotes further insulin resistance in the adipose tissue and liver, which results in a harmful cycle of insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and inflammation.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adipose tissue dysfunction also decreases  secretion of the insulin-sensitizing [[adipokine]] [[adiponectin]] in people with NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adiponectin has several properties that protect the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These properties include improved liver fat metabolism, decreased ''de novo'' lipogenesis, decreased [[gluconeogenesis|glucose production in the liver]], [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, and [[Antifibrotic|anti-fibrotic]] properties.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> [[Skeletal muscle]] insulin resistance may also play a role in NAFLD. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is not as efficient at taking up glucose from the bloodstream after a meal.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> This inefficient glucose uptake promotes the redistribution of consumed carbohydrates from glucose destined for use in [[glycogen]] stores in the skeletal muscles to being used as a substrate for ''de novo'' lipogenesis in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>\n\n===Dysbiosis===\nDisruptions in the intestinal microbiota seem to influence NAFLD risk in several ways. People with NASH can have elevated levels of blood ethanol and [[proteobacteria]] (which produce alcohol), with dysbiosis proposed as a mechanism for this elevation.<ref name=Leung2016 /> Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may influence NAFLD risk in several ways. These changes appear to increase the permeability of intestinal tissue, thereby facilitating increased liver exposure to harmful substances (e.g., translocated bacteria, [[Lipopolysaccharide|bacterial toxins]], and [[Cytokine|inflammatory chemical signals]]). The increased transport of these harmful substances to the liver promotes liver inflammation, enhances nutrient and calorie absorption, and alters [[choline]] metabolism.<ref name=Leung2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung C, Rivera L, Furness JB, Angus PW | title = The role of the gut microbiota in NAFLD | journal = Nature Reviews.

If any of these factors are observed, an investigation into alternative causes of fatty liver unrelated to NAFLD is recommended. A history of chronic alcohol usage is an important consideration.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AASLD2018\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" /><ref name=\"NICE2016\" /><ref name=\"EASL2016\" />\n\nNAFLD comprises two histological categories: NAFL, and the more aggressive form NASH. The presence of at least 5% [[fatty liver]] is common to both NAFL and NASH, but the features of substantial lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuries such as ballooning or Mallory hyaline only occur in NASH. The majority of NAFL cases show minimal or no inflammation.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AASLD2018\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" /> Pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis occur more often in adult-onset NASH, whereas portal fibrosis is more common in children with the disorder. NASH represents a more advanced stage of NAFL and is associated with poor outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. ICD-11 does not use the term NAFL as it was deemed confusing with the family of disorders NAFLD. The preferred descriptions are instead: NAFLD without NASH or simple steatosis and \"NASH\". Also, the modifier with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis completes the diagnostic description.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" />\n\n===Blood tests===\nElevated [[liver enzyme]]s are common. According to [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) guidelines, it is disadvised to test enzymes levels to rule out NAFLD, as they are often within the normal range even in advanced disease.<ref name=Nature2016 /><ref name=\"NICE2016\" /><ref name=Younossi2017/>\n\nBlood tests that are useful to confirm diagnosis or rule out others include [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], [[glucose]], [[human serum albumin|albumin]], and [[kidney function]]. Because the liver is important for making proteins used in [[coagulation|blood clotting]], coagulation-related studies are often carried out, especially the INR ([[international normalized ratio]]). In people with fatty liver with associated inflammatory injury (steatohepatitis) blood tests are usually used to rule out viral [[hepatitis]] (hepatitis&nbsp;A, B, C and [[herpesvirus]]es such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Human cytomegalovirus|cytomegalovirus]]), [[rubella]], and autoimmune diseases.

First, it promotes the release of [[free fatty acid]]s (FFAs) from [[adipose tissue]] into the blood. Typically, adipose tissue stores lipids in the form of [[triglyceride]]s, slowly releasing them into the bloodstream when insulin is low. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, such as in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, more triglycerides are [[lipolysis|broken down]] into FFAs and released into the bloodstream, promoting uptake by the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Second, insulin promotes the production of new FFAs in the liver via [[Lipogenesis|''de novo'' lipogenesis]]; this production of liver fats continues to be stimulated by insulin, even when other tissues are insulin-resistant.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These FFAs are combined back into triglycerides in the liver, forming the major constituent of the accumulated fat in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> The three sources of free fatty acids that contribute to liver triglyceride accumulation include FFAs circulating in the bloodstream (59%), FFAs derived from carbohydrates such as fructose and glucose (26%), and diet (14%).<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Despite the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, they are not directly toxic to liver tissue.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Instead, alteration of the profile of the other lipid subtypes present in the liver, such as [[diacylglycerol]]s, [[phospholipid]]s, [[ceramide]]s, and free [[cholesterol]], have a more significant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>  \n\nOnce NAFLD progresses in severity to the point of NASH, this promotes further insulin resistance in the adipose tissue and liver, which results in a harmful cycle of insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and inflammation.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adipose tissue dysfunction also decreases  secretion of the insulin-sensitizing [[adipokine]] [[adiponectin]] in people with NAFLD.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> Adiponectin has several properties that protect the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> These properties include improved liver fat metabolism, decreased ''de novo'' lipogenesis, decreased [[gluconeogenesis|glucose production in the liver]], [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, and [[Antifibrotic|anti-fibrotic]] properties.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> [[Skeletal muscle]] insulin resistance may also play a role in NAFLD. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is not as efficient at taking up glucose from the bloodstream after a meal.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/> This inefficient glucose uptake promotes the redistribution of consumed carbohydrates from glucose destined for use in [[glycogen]] stores in the skeletal muscles to being used as a substrate for ''de novo'' lipogenesis in the liver.<ref name=\"Marjot2020\"/>\n\n===Dysbiosis===\nDisruptions in the intestinal microbiota seem to influence NAFLD risk in several ways. People with NASH can have elevated levels of blood ethanol and [[proteobacteria]] (which produce alcohol), with dysbiosis proposed as a mechanism for this elevation.<ref name=Leung2016 /> Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may influence NAFLD risk in several ways. These changes appear to increase the permeability of intestinal tissue, thereby facilitating increased liver exposure to harmful substances (e.g., translocated bacteria, [[Lipopolysaccharide|bacterial toxins]], and [[Cytokine|inflammatory chemical signals]]).

If any of these factors are observed, an investigation into alternative causes of fatty liver unrelated to NAFLD is recommended. A history of chronic alcohol usage is an important consideration.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AASLD2018\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" /><ref name=\"NICE2016\" /><ref name=\"EASL2016\" />\n\nNAFLD comprises two histological categories: NAFL, and the more aggressive form NASH. The presence of at least 5% [[fatty liver]] is common to both NAFL and NASH, but the features of substantial lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuries such as ballooning or Mallory hyaline only occur in NASH. The majority of NAFL cases show minimal or no inflammation.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AASLD2018\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" /> Pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis occur more often in adult-onset NASH, whereas portal fibrosis is more common in children with the disorder. NASH represents a more advanced stage of NAFL and is associated with poor outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. ICD-11 does not use the term NAFL as it was deemed confusing with the family of disorders NAFLD. The preferred descriptions are instead: NAFLD without NASH or simple steatosis and \"NASH\". Also, the modifier with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis completes the diagnostic description.<ref name=\"ICD11\" /><ref name=\"AsiaPacific2017-1\" />\n\n===Blood tests===\nElevated [[liver enzyme]]s are common.

Because the liver is important for making proteins used in [[coagulation|blood clotting]], coagulation-related studies are often carried out, especially the INR ([[international normalized ratio]]). In people with fatty liver with associated inflammatory injury (steatohepatitis) blood tests are usually used to rule out viral [[hepatitis]] (hepatitis&nbsp;A, B, C and [[herpesvirus]]es such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Human cytomegalovirus|cytomegalovirus]]), [[rubella]], and autoimmune diseases.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites converted to [[Christianity]], banded together and took the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gathered their weapons, buried them, and committed to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites. God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attacked them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did not attack back, instead allowed themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 had been killed, the Lamanites felt guilty and stopped attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then joined the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled. To avoid further attacks on them, God commanded Ammon to lead the group to join the Nephites, and they changed their name to the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|People of Ammon]] or Ammonites.

The young stripling warriors fought alongside the Nephite army and were one of the Nephites' most effective military units.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E.

Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the [[Nephites]] and a wicked faction called the [[Lamanites]].  To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \"a skin of blackness\" so they would \"not be enticing\".<ref>Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 5:21, 23  online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng</ref>\n\nAround 92BC, four sons of the [[King Mosiah II|Nephite King]], named [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)#Ammon\u00b2|Ammon]], [[Aaron (Nephite)|Aaron]], [[Omner]], and [[Himni]], went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to [[Christianity]].  A significant number of Lamanites converted to [[Christianity]], banded together and took the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite.  The king of the newly formed people dies, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi.  Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign to their covenant with God, they gathered their weapons, buried them, and committed to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites. God then lifts their curse of dark skin.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 23 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng</ref>\n\nThe wicked portion of the Lamanites attacked them, but the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did not attack back, instead allowed themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer.  After 1,005 had been killed, the Lamanites felt guilty and stopped attacking.  Many of the Lamanites then joined the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 24 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng</ref>  Others are rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled. To avoid further attacks on them, God commanded Ammon to lead the group to join the Nephites, and they changed their name to the [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|People of Ammon]] or Ammonites.  They were given the Land of Jershon by the Nephites.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 25 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng</ref>\n\nWhen an anti-christ named [[Korihor]] tried to teach atheism to the Ammonites, they bound him and took him to the high priest.<ref>Book of Mormon Alma 30:21-29 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng</ref>\n\n===Stripling Warriors===\nIn a subsequent war between the Nephites and Lamanites, when the Ammonites saw how the Nephite army suffered in defending them, they considered breaking their oath to lay down their weapons and defend themselves; a Nephite prophet named [[Helaman (Book of Mormon)|Helaman]] persuaded them not to break their oath.

The Nephites on the other hand justified their defense of their\nfamilies and liberties on the ground that it was the will of God that these things be preserved. However the readers of these lessons might feel on this subject, it seems clear that if war has any justification at all in the eyes of God, it must be a war of defense, not aggression\u2014a war where the right to worship, and to live in family units, and in safety are being fought for.\"<ref>Deseret Sunday School Union, The Quorum Bulletin and Gospel Doctrine Sunday School Quarterly 6/1 (January\u2013March 1939): 11\u201313.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitute a just war.<ref name=Pulsipher2017 />  \n\nIn 1950, Professor William E.

There is an inconsistency between the two accounts; in the first account the Lamanites are driven back after one great battle, while in the second there there are \"many battles\".<ref name=Hardy2010 />  Of the discrepancy, LDS Church Book of Mormon Scholar [[Grant Hardy]] writes that this might be an example of the narrator \"trying not to unduly burden his narrative with unnecessary details,\" and that one version is presented for historical reasons while the other is to promote a spiritual message.<ref name=Hardy2010 />\n\nThe text of the Book of Mormon notes that hundreds of the stripling warriors \"fainted because of blood\".<ref>Book of Mormon Chapter 57 https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng</ref> Surgeon Robert Patterson observed of the miracle that \"the epic tale of the stripling warriors and their miraculous recovery from life-threatening trauma would appear, to the rational mind, highly unlikely or even outright impossible. Hundreds of people, even fit young males, simply do not get up and walk away after experiencing Class 4 [[hypovolemic shock]].  Perhaps even [[Joseph Smith]], uneducated as he was, did not appreciate the improbability of Helaman's narrative.\"<ref name=Patterson2002 />\n\n===Criticism===\nA major theme and stated purpose of the Book of Mormon, is the conversion the modern day Lamanite descendants to Christianity.<ref name=McBride2016>McBride, M.
