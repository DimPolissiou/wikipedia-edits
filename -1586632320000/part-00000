The term \"sexual revolution\" itself has been used since at least the late 1920s.<ref>The term appeared as early as 1929; the book ''Is Sex Necessary?'' by Thurber & White, has a chapter titled ''The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene''.<br/>\nAccording to [[w:ru:\u0414\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Konstantin Dushenko]], the term was in use in Russia in 1925. {{cite web|url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |title=(no title) |accessdate=2008-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504082655/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/87856.html |archivedate=2008-05-04 }}\n</ref>\n\nWhen speaking of the sexual revolution, historians<ref>The First Sexual Revolution: The Emergence of Male Heterosexuality in Modern America. Kevin White (New York: New York University Press: 1992)</ref> make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870\u20131910), Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a \"permissive society\". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.\n\nClassics professor Kyle Harper uses the phrase \"first sexual revolution\" to refer to the displacement of the norms of [[sexuality in Ancient Rome]] with those of Christianity as it was adopted throughout the Roman Empire.  Romans accepted and legalized [[prostitution]], [[bisexuality]], and [[pederasty]]. Male promiscuity was considered normal and healthy as long as masculinity was maintained, associated with being the penetrating partner. On the other hand, female chastity was required for respectable women, to ensure the integrity of family bloodlines. These attitudes were replaced by Christian prohibitions on homosexual acts and any sex outside marriage (including with slaves and prostitutes).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/01/the-first-sexual-revolution |title=The First Sexual Revolution / How Christianity transformed the ancient world |author=Kyle Harper |date=January 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistory professor Faramerz Dabhoiwala cites the [[Age of Enlightenment]]\u2014approximately the [[18th century]]\u2014 as a major period of transition in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution |author=Faramerz Dabhoiwala |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199892419}}</ref> During this time the philosophy of [[liberalism]] developed and was popularized, and migration to cities increased opportunities for sex and made enforcement of rules more difficult than in small villages. Sexual misconduct in the Catholic Church (called the \"[[Whore of Babylon]]\" by some Protestant critics) undermined the credibility of religious authorities, and the rise of urban police forces helped distinguish [[crime]] from [[sin]]. Overall, toleration increased for heterosexual sex outside marriage, including prostitution, mistresses, and pre-marital sex. Though these acts were still condemned by many as [[libertine]], infidelity became more often a civil matter than a criminal offense receiving capital punishment. The rate of out-of-wedlock births went from about 1% in 1650 to about 25% in 1800, with about 40% of [[shotgun wedding|brides being pregnant]].<ref>[https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-first-sexual-revolution/ Quoted at]</ref> [[Masturbation]], [[homosexuality]], and [[rape]] were generally less tolerated.

Another likely cause was a vast improvement in [[obstetrics]], greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the [[life expectancy]] of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and early 1950s all over the western world\u2014the \"[[Baby Boom Generation]]\"\u2014many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before.

Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were [[Psychological repression|repressed]] and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy \"[[psychoanalysis]]\".\n\nWhile Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary [[libido|sexual drive]] that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]], and his theory of [[psychosexual development]] proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the [[Oedipus complex]], a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets were particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th-century society. \n\nAccording to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the [[oral stage]], the mother's breast became the formative source of all later [[erotic]] sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.\n\n[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] Freud scholars [[Otto Gross]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase \"Sexual Revolution\") developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s to 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the Freudian interpretation, and hence the liberation of sexual behavior a mean to social revolution.\n\n==The role of mass media==\n===Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa''===\n{{Main|Margaret Mead|Coming of Age in Samoa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThe publication of anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's [[ethnography]] focused on the psychosexual development of adolescents in [[Samoa]]. She recorded that their adolescence was not, in fact, a time of \"storm and stress\" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in the suppression of sexuality in America, and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.\n\nMead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sullivan|first=Gerald|chapter=Freeman, Derek (1916\u20132001)|date=2006|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/anthropology/n356.xml|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Anthropology|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412952453.n356|isbn=9780761930297|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In 1948 Alfred&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behavior in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behavior in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.\n\nIt is said that [[public morality]] severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviors that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors aged two weeks to fourteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data that led to the conclusion that people are capable of sexual stimulation from birth. Furthermore, Kinsey's method of researching sexuality differs significantly from today's methods. Kinsey would watch his research subjects engage in sexual intercourse, sometimes engaging with his subjects as well. He would also encourage his research team to do the same, and encouraged them to engage in intercourse with him, too.\n\nThese books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A study called ''Human Sexual Response'' in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sexual practices of young Americans.\n\n===The ''Playboy'' culture===\n[[File:New York Playboy Club Bunnies aboard USS Wainwright (DLG-28) c1971.jpg|thumb|[[Playboy Bunnies]] aboard US Navy ship ([[USS Wainwright (CG-28)|USS ''Wainwright'']] (CG-28)), 1971]]\n\nIn 1953, Chicago resident [[Hugh Hefner]] founded [[Playboy]], a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45.<ref name=hefsex /> The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured [[Marilyn Monroe]], then a rising [[sex symbol]].<ref name=marilyn>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvwH7euUccIC&lpg=PA75&dq=marilyn%20playboy&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=playboy&f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = 2012-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/01/554854492/marilyn-monroe-helped-hugh-hefner-but-not-by-choice|title=Marilyn Monroe Helped Hugh Hefner, But Not By Choice|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}</ref>  Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner's \"Playboy Philosophy\" and unclothed female \"Playmates\" posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful.<ref name=hefsex />\n\nIn 1960, Hefner expanded [[Playboy Enterprises]], opening the first [[Playboy Club]] in Chicago,<ref name=hefsex /> which grew to a chain of nightclubs and resorts.

This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|1959 Obscene Publications Act]] and reaching a peak with the LCL&nbsp; court case.\n\nPrior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the [[United States Customs Service]] banned [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made \"[[banned in Boston]]\" a national by-word.\n\nIn 1959 [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S.&nbsp; Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.\n\n[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&nbsp; Supreme Court's]] 1964 decision in ''Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein''.\n\nIn 1963 Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750&nbsp;novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.&nbsp; Supreme Court and won. In ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'', 383&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp;413, the court ruled that sex was \"a great and mysterious motive force in human life\", and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].\n\nBy permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill'', the U.S.&nbsp; Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966&nbsp; decision \"the end of obscenity\". Only books primarily appealing to \"prurient interest\" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is \"utterly without redeeming social importance\"\u2014meaning that, conversely, a work with any redeeming social importance or [[literary merit]] was arguably not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could \"deprave and corrupt\" some readers.\n\n===Nonfiction===\nThe court decisions that legalized the publication of ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often. These books were factual and in fact, educational, made available in mainstream bookstores and [[Book sales club|mail-order book clubs]] to a mainstream readership, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence and, by the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect.\n\nThe open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books. The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980&nbsp; book by Dr.&nbsp; Irene Kassorla, that ''Nice Girls Do \u2014 And Now You Can Too''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.''\n\nIn 1969 [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as \"J.\", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]]'', with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.\n\nThe same year saw the appearance of Dr.&nbsp;[[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben's]] book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.\n\nIn 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and Their Bodies'', reissued a year later as ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Though not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.\n\n[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making'' appeared in 1972. In later editions, Comfort's exuberance was tamed in response to [[AIDS]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride's]] ''Zeig Mal!'' ([[Show Me!]]), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescent sexual discovery and exploration, it scandalized others and was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. The book was followed in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!''

The 1951 film ''[[Hon damage en sommar]]'' (''She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') displayed explicit nudity, including bathing in a lake.\n\nThis film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika'', 1951) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|Tystnaden]] (The Silence'', 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sj\u00f6man's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''[[491 (film)|491]]'', highlighted homosexuality. ''[[Language of Love|K\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k]]'' (''The Language of Love'') was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film.\n\nFrom these films, the myth of \"Swedish sin\" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) arose. The image of \"hot love and cold people\" emerged, with sexual liberalism seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Carl |last1=Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People.

The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others.\n\n===Normalization of pornography===\n{{Further|History of pornography|Golden Age of Porn}}\nThe somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon. Pornography operated as a form of \"cultural critique\" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. [[Manuel Castells]] claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin-board systems, originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.<ref name=Pronography>{{cite journal |last=Garlick |first=Steve |title=A New Sexual Revolution?

The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for gender differences and that they{{who|date=January 2019}} could lose their meaning or at least redefine the meaning of gender roles and norms.<ref name=Pronography />\n\nIn 1971 ''[[Playboy]]'' stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\nIn 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\nPornography was less stigmatized by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as entertainment. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.\n\nSome figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or \"urban men's\" magazines. Other feminists such as [[Betty Dodson]] went on to found the [[pro-sex feminist]] movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.\n\nIn India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |title='Sexual freedom' parade at Jantar Mantar this weekend - Times of India |accessdate=2016-08-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230150423/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |archivedate=2016-12-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Modern revolutions==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] during the nineteenth century and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condom]]s that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]], popularly known as \"the Pill.\"\n\nAll these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in the world [[literacy]] and a decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of \"be fruitful and multiply\" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.\n\nAnother contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and similar philosophers.\n\n\"[[No-fault divorce|No-fault]]\" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\n\nThe women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. \"[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]\" by [[Anne Koedt]] illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy, arguing against Freud's \"assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role.\"<ref name=\"Vaginal Orgasm\">{{cite web|last=Koedt |first=Anne |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |accessdate=16 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=6 January 2013 }}</ref> The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published the [[Feminine Mystique]] in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.\n\n[[File:CDFrontInsert.FreedomToLove.Pride.WDC.31May2009.jpg|thumb|1997 [[LGBT]] poster, New York City]]\nThe [[Gay Rights Movement]] started when the [[Stonewall Riots]] of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to \"coming out\" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was \"coming out\", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.<ref name=GLBTQ /> The \"coming out\" phenomenon helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies. [[Brad Gooch]] wrote in the \"Golden Age of Promiscuity\" that the gay male community finally had reached a rich culture of \"easy sex\", sex without commitment, obligation or long-term relationships.<ref name=GLBTQ />{{better source|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Feminism and sexual liberation==\n{{POV section|date=September 2018}}\nCoinciding with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[women's liberation movement]] initiated in the early 1960s, the sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]] and [[queer]] sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women as well as support for women's right to choose her sexual partners free of outside interference or judgment were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.<ref name=\"Ending Female Sexual Oppression\">{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nThe feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence.

Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area.  Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.\n\nNevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.<ref name=\"Willis 1984 121\">{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 1960s without Apology |issue=9/10|pages=91\u2013118|year=1984|doi=10.2307/466537|jstor=466537|ref=harv}}</ref> In ''[[Anticlimax (book)|Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.<ref name=\"Zoftig 1982 88\">{{citation | last = Zoftig | first = Sarah | contribution = Coming out | editor-last = SAMOIS | editor-link = Samois | title = Coming to power: writings and graphics on lesbian S/M: S/M, a form of eroticism based on a consenual exchange of power | page = [https://archive.org/details/comingtopowerwri00samo/page/88 88] | publisher = Alyson Publications | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780932870285 | edition = 2nd | ref = harv | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/comingtopowerwri00samo/page/88 }}</ref><ref name=\"Vance 1992 302\">{{cite book | last = Vance | first = Carole S. | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | page = 302 | publisher = Pandora Press  | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780044408673 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{citation | last = Egerton | first = Jane | contribution = Sheila Jeffreys | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = Harriett | editor-link = Harriett Gilbert | title = The sexual imagination from Acker to Zola: a feminist companion | page = [https://archive.org/details/sexualimaginatio0000unse/page/133 133] | publisher = Jonathan Cape | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780224035354 | ref = harv | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/sexualimaginatio0000unse/page/133 }}</ref><ref name=\"Denfeld 1995 35\">{{citation | last = Denfeld | first = Rene | author-link = Rene Denfeld | contribution = The antiphallic campaign: male bashing and sexual politics | editor-last = Denfeld | editor-first = Rene | editor-link = Rene Denfeld | title = The new Victorians: a young woman's challenge to the old feminist order | pages = 35 | publisher = Allen & Unwin | location = St Leonards, New South Wales | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781863737890 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].\n\n==Contraception==\nAs [[birth control]] became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for the promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]]. The Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI (1968) published ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' (Of Human Life), which was a declaration that banned the use of artificial contraception. Churches allowed for the rhythm method, which was a natural method of regulating fertility that pushed men and women to take advantage of the \"natural cycles\" of female fertility, during which women were \"naturally infertile.\" The opposition of Churches (e.g.&nbsp;''[[Humanae vitae]]'') led people who felt alienated from or not represented by religion to form parallel movements of [[secularization]] and exile from religion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |title=Fri, Jul 25, 2008 - 'Humanae Vitae' birth control ban set off a wave of dissent |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122234704/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |archivedate=2011-11-22 }}</ref> Women gained much greater access to birth control in the ''Griswold'' \"girls world\" decision in 1965.  \n\nThe landmark ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' case ruled that the prohibition of contraception was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated peoples' rights to [[marital privacy]]. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s, the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. The ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' case and subsequent birth control movements created a precedent for later cases granting rights to birth control for unmarried couples ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird|(Eisenstadt v. Baird]], 1972)'', rights to abortion for any woman (''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 1973), and the right to contraception for juveniles ([[Carey v. Population Services International]], 1977). The Griswold case was also influential in and cited as precedent for landmark cases dealing with the right to homosexual relations (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]],'' 2003) and the right to same-sex marriage (''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]],'' 2015).\n\n==Free love==\n{{Main|Free love}}\nBeginning in [[San Francisco]] in the mid-1960s, a new culture of \"[[free love]]\" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming \"[[hippies]]\", inspired by [[India]]n culture, who preached the power of love and the beauty of sex as part of ordinary life. This is part of a [[counterculture]] that continues to exist. By the 1970s, it was socially acceptable for colleges to permit co-ed housing.\n\nFree love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or at least disappeared from public view) in the mid-1980s when the public first became aware of [[AIDS]], a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.\n\n==Non-marital sex==\n[[Premarital sex]], heavily stigmatized for some time, became more widely accepted. The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the legalization of [[abortion]] in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.<ref>For an analysis and facts about how technological advance in contraception changed the cost/benefit analysis for engaging in premarital sex, see Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Greenwood, and Guner (2014) \"From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years: An Economic Model of the Rise in Premarital Sex and its De-Stigmatization,\" ''[[Journal of the European Economic Association]]'', '''12''' (1): 25-61.

On average, Americans were gaining sexual experience before entering into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation.<ref name=GLBTQ /> By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was acceptable, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and as well less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\nThe idea of marriage being outdated came from the development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every known sexually transmitted disease was readily treatable.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\n[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinger clubs]] were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that offered a range of [[Extramarital sex|sexual possibilities with multiple partners]].

According to this concept or interpretation (first evolved by [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]), the 'sexual revolution' would be an instance of a conservative force masquerading under the guise of liberation - a force sapping energies (here sexual) which would otherwise be available for a true social [[critique]] of a given behavior - and thus an impediment to any real political change which might emancipate the individual from \"[[totalitarian democracy]]\". (See also [[Bread and circuses]], [[False consciousness]] and [[Frankfurt School]]). Put baldly, the pursuit of \"sexual freedom\" may be construed as a distraction from the pursuit of ''actual'' freedom.{{sfn|Marcuse|1964|pp=59, 75\u201382}}\n\nAllyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal.

By Kevin White (New York: New York University Press: 1992)</ref> make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870\u20131910), Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a \"permissive society\". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.\n\nClassics professor Kyle Harper uses the phrase \"first sexual revolution\" to refer to the displacement of the norms of [[sexuality in Ancient Rome]] with those of Christianity as it was adopted throughout the Roman Empire.  Romans accepted and legalized [[prostitution]], [[bisexuality]], and [[pederasty]]. Male promiscuity was considered normal and healthy as long as masculinity was maintained, associated with being the penetrating partner. On the other hand, female chastity was required for respectable women, to ensure integrity of family bloodlines. These attitudes were replaced by Christian prohibitions on homosexual acts and any sex outside marriage (including with slaves and prostitutes).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/01/the-first-sexual-revolution |title=The First Sexual Revolution / How Christianity transformed the ancient world |author=Kyle Harper |date=January 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistory professor Faramerz Dabhoiwala cites the [[Age of Enlightenment]]\u2014approximately the [[18th century]]\u2014 as a major period of transition in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution |author=Faramerz Dabhoiwala |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199892419}}</ref> During this time the philosophy of [[liberalism]] developed and was popularized, and migration to cities increased opportunities for sex and made enforcement of rules more difficult than in small villages. Sexual misconduct in the Catholic Church (called the \"[[Whore of Babylon]]\" by some Protestant critics) undermined credibility of religious authorities, and the rise of urban police forces helped distinguish [[crime]] from [[sin]]. Overall, toleration increased for heterosexual sex outside marriage, including prostitution, mistresses, and pre-marital sex. Though these acts were still condemned by many as [[libertine]], infidelity became more often a civil matter than a criminal offense receiving capital punishment. The rate of out-of-wedlock births went from about 1% in 1650 to about 25% in 1800, with about 40% of [[shotgun wedding|brides being pregnant]].<ref>[https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-first-sexual-revolution/ Quoted at]</ref> [[Masturbation]], [[homosexuality]], and [[rape]] were generally less tolerated.

Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were [[Psychological repression|repressed]] and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy \"[[psychoanalysis]]\".\n\nWhile Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary [[libido|sexual drive]] that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]], and his theory of [[psychosexual development]] proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the [[Oedipus complex]], a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th century society.\n\nAccording to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the [[oral stage]], the mother's breast became the formative source of all later [[erotic]] sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.\n\n[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] Freud scholars [[Otto Gross]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase \"Sexual Revolution\") developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s to 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the freudian interpretation, and hence the liberation of sexual behavior a mean to social revolution.\n\n==The role of mass media==\n===Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa''===\n{{Main|Margaret Mead|Coming of Age in Samoa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThe publication of anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's [[ethnography]] focused on the psychosexual development of adolescents in [[Samoa]]. She recorded that their adolescence was not in fact a time of \"storm and stress\" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America, and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.\n\nMead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sullivan|first=Gerald|chapter=Freeman, Derek (1916\u20132001)|date=2006|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/anthropology/n356.xml|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Anthropology|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412952453.n356|isbn=9780761930297|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behaviour. In 1948 Alfred&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual behaviour in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.\n\nIt is said that [[public morality]] severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviours that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors aged two weeks to fourteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data which led to the conclusion that people are capable of sexual stimulation from birth. Furthermore, Kinsey's method of researching sexuality differs significantly from today's methods. Kinsey would watch his research subjects engage in sexual intercourse, sometimes engaging with his subjects as well. He would also encourage his research team to do the same, and encouraged them to engage in intercourse with him, too.\n\nThese books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A study called ''Human Sexual Response'' in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sexual practices of young Americans.\n\n===The ''Playboy'' culture===\n[[File:New York Playboy Club Bunnies aboard USS Wainwright (DLG-28) c1971.jpg|thumb|[[Playboy Bunnies]] aboard US Navy ship ([[USS Wainwright (CG-28)|USS ''Wainwright'']] (CG-28)), 1971]]\n\nIn 1953, Chicago resident [[Hugh Hefner]] founded [[Playboy]], a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45.<ref name=hefsex /> The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured [[Marilyn Monroe]], then a rising [[sex symbol]].<ref name=marilyn>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvwH7euUccIC&lpg=PA75&dq=marilyn%20playboy&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=playboy&f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = 2012-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/01/554854492/marilyn-monroe-helped-hugh-hefner-but-not-by-choice|title=Marilyn Monroe Helped Hugh Hefner, But Not By Choice|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}</ref>  Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner's \"Playboy Philosophy\" and unclothed female \"Playmates\" posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful.<ref name=hefsex />\n\nIn 1960, Hefner expanded [[Playboy Enterprises]], opening the first [[Playboy Club]] in Chicago,<ref name=hefsex /> which grew to a chain of nightclubs and resorts.

This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|1959 Obscene Publications Act]] and reaching a peak with the LCL&nbsp;court case.\n\nPrior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the [[United States Customs Service]] banned [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made \"[[banned in Boston]]\" a national by-word.\n\nIn 1959 [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S.&nbsp;Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.\n\n[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&nbsp;Supreme Court's]] 1964 decision in ''Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein''.\n\nIn 1963 Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750&nbsp;novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.&nbsp;Supreme Court and won. In ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'', 383&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;413, the court ruled that sex was \"a great and mysterious motive force in human life\", and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].\n\nBy permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill'', the U.S.&nbsp;Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966&nbsp;decision \"the end of obscenity\". Only books primarily appealing to \"prurient interest\" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is \"utterly without redeeming social importance\"\u2014meaning that, conversely, a work with any redeeming social importance or [[literary merit]] was arguably not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could \"deprave and corrupt\" some readers.\n\n===Nonfiction===\nThe court decisions that legalised the publication of ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often. These books were factual and in fact educational, made available in mainstream bookstores and [[Book sales club|mail-order book clubs]] to a mainstream readership, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence and, by the 1950s, in the United States it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect.\n\nThe open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books. The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980&nbsp;book by Dr.&nbsp;Irene Kassorla, that ''Nice Girls Do \u2014 And Now You Can Too''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.''\n\nIn 1969 [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as \"J.\", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]]'', with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.\n\nThe same year saw the appearance of Dr.&nbsp;[[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben's]] book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.\n\nIn 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and Their Bodies'', reissued a year later as ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Though not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.\n\n[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making'' appeared in 1972. In later editions, Comfort's exuberance was tamed in response to [[AIDS]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride's]] ''Zeig Mal!'' ([[Show Me!]]), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescent sexual discovery and exploration, it scandalised others and was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. The book was followed in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!'' (\"Show Me More!\").\n\n===Pornographic film===\nIn 1969, ''[[Blue Movie]]'', directed by [[Andy Warhol]], was the first [[pornographic|adult erotic film]] depicting explicit [[sex]] to receive wide theatrical release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"NYT-19690722\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Movie Review - Blue Movie (1968) Screen: Andy Warhol's 'Blue Movie' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |date=July 22, 1969 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231190855/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E5D91738E63ABC4A51DFB1668382679EDE |archivedate=December 31, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WS-2002-2005\">{{cite web |last=Comenas |first=Gary |title=Blue Movie (1968) |url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |date=2005 |work=WarholStars.org |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230082332/http://www.warholstars.org/andy-warhol-blue-movie.html |archivedate=December 30, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-19690810\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Warhol's Red Hot and 'Blue' Movie.

The 1951 film ''[[Hon dansade en sommar]]'' (''She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') displayed explicit nudity, including bathing in a lake.\n\nThis film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika'', 1951) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|Tystnaden]] (The Silence'', 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sj\u00f6man's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''[[491 (film)|491]]'', highlighted homosexuality. ''[[Language of Love|K\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k]]'' (''The Language of Love'') was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film.\n\nFrom these films the myth of \"Swedish sin\" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) arose. The image of \"hot love and cold people\" emerged, with sexual liberalism seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Carl |last1=Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People.

The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others.\n\n===Normalization of pornography===\n{{Further|History of pornography|Golden Age of Porn}}\nThe somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon. Pornography operated as a form of \"cultural critique\" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. [[Manuel Castells]] claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin-board systems, originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.<ref name=Pronography>{{cite journal |last=Garlick |first=Steve |title=A New Sexual Revolution?

The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for gender differences and that they{{who|date=January 2019}} could lose their meaning or at least redefine the meaning of gender roles and norms.<ref name=Pronography />\n\nIn 1971 ''[[Playboy]]'' stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\nIn 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\nPornography was less stigmatised by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as entertainment. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.\n\nSome figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or \"urban men's\" magazines. Other feminists such as [[Betty Dodson]] went on to found the [[pro-sex feminist]] movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.\n\nIn India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |title='Sexual freedom' parade at Jantar Mantar this weekend - Times of India |accessdate=2016-08-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230150423/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |archivedate=2016-12-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Modern revolutions==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] during the nineteenth century and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condom]]s that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]], popularly known as \"the Pill.\"\n\nAll these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of \"be fruitful and multiply\" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.\n\nAnother contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and similar philosophers.\n\n\"[[No-fault divorce|No-fault]]\" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\n\nThe women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. \"[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]\" by [[Anne Koedt]] illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy, arguing against Freud's \"assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role.\"<ref name=\"Vaginal Orgasm\">{{cite web|last=Koedt |first=Anne |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |accessdate=16 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=6 January 2013 }}</ref> The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction.

During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was \"coming out\", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.<ref name=GLBTQ /> The \"coming out\" phenomenon helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies.

Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women as well as support for women's right to choose her sexual partners free of outside interference or judgement were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.<ref name=\"Ending Female Sexual Oppression\">{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nThe feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological.

Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.\n\nNevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.<ref name=\"Willis 1984 121\">{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 1960s without Apology |issue=9/10|pages=91\u2013118|year=1984|doi=10.2307/466537|jstor=466537|ref=harv}}</ref> In ''[[Anticlimax (book)|Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.<ref name=\"Zoftig 1982 88\">{{citation | last = Zoftig | first = Sarah | contribution = Coming out | editor-last = SAMOIS | editor-link = Samois | title = Coming to power: writings and graphics on lesbian S/M: S/M, a form of eroticism based on a consenual exchange of power | page = [https://archive.org/details/comingtopowerwri00samo/page/88 88] | publisher = Alyson Publications | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780932870285 | edition = 2nd | ref = harv | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/comingtopowerwri00samo/page/88 }}</ref><ref name=\"Vance 1992 302\">{{cite book | last = Vance | first = Carole S. | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | page = 302 | publisher = Pandora Press  | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780044408673 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{citation | last = Egerton | first = Jane | contribution = Sheila Jeffreys | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = Harriett | editor-link = Harriett Gilbert | title = The sexual imagination from Acker to Zola: a feminist companion | page = [https://archive.org/details/sexualimaginatio0000unse/page/133 133] | publisher = Jonathan Cape | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780224035354 | ref = harv | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/sexualimaginatio0000unse/page/133 }}</ref><ref name=\"Denfeld 1995 35\">{{citation | last = Denfeld | first = Rene | author-link = Rene Denfeld | contribution = The antiphallic campaign: male bashing and sexual politics | editor-last = Denfeld | editor-first = Rene | editor-link = Rene Denfeld | title = The new Victorians: a young woman's challenge to the old feminist order | pages = 35 | publisher = Allen & Unwin | location = St Leonards, New South Wales | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781863737890 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].\n\n==Contraception==\nAs [[birth control]] became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]]. The Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI (1968) published ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' (Of Human Life), which was a declaration that banned the use of artificial contraception. Churches allowed for the rhythm method, which was a natural method of regulating fertility that pushed men and women to take advantage of the \"natural cycles\" of female fertility, during which women were \"naturally infertile.\" The opposition of Churches (e.g.&nbsp;''[[Humanae vitae]]'') led people who felt alienated from or not represented by religion to form parallel movements of [[secularization]] and exile from religion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |title=Fri, Jul 25, 2008 - 'Humanae Vitae' birth control ban set off a wave of dissent |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2011-11-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122234704/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |archivedate=2011-11-22 }}</ref> Women gained much greater access to birth control in the ''Griswold'' \"girls world\" decision in 1965.  \n\nThe landmark ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' case ruled that the prohibition of contraception was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated peoples' rights to [[marital privacy]]. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. The ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' case and  subsequent birth control movements created a precedent for later cases granting rights to birth control for unmarried couples ''[[Eisenstadt v. Baird|(Eisenstadt v. Baird]], 1972)'', rights to abortion for any woman (''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 1973), and the right to contraception for juveniles ([[Carey v. Population Services International]], 1977). The Griswold case was also influential in and cited as precedent for landmark cases dealing with the right to homosexual relations (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]],'' 2003) and the right to same-sex marriage (''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]],'' 2015).\n\n==Free love==\n{{Main|Free love}}\nBeginning in [[San Francisco]] in the mid-1960s, a new culture of \"[[free love]]\" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming \"[[hippies]]\", inspired by [[India]]n culture, who preached the power of love and the beauty of sex as part of ordinary life. This is part of a [[counterculture]] that continues to exist. By the 1970s, it was socially acceptable for colleges to permit co-ed housing.\n\nFree love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or at least disappeared from public view) in the mid-1980s when the public first became aware of [[AIDS]], a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.\n\n==Non-marital sex==\n[[Premarital sex]], heavily stigmatised for some time, became more widely accepted. The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the legalisation of [[abortion]] in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.<ref>For an analysis and facts about how technological advance in contraception changed the cost/benefit analysis for engaging in premaritial sex, see Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Greenwood, and Guner (2014) \"From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years: An Economic Model of the Rise in Premarital Sex and its De-Stigmitization,\" ''[[Journal of the European Economic Association]]'', '''12''' (1): 25-61. The research is summerized in this video: {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026114212/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |archivedate=2015-10-26 }}</ref>\n\nCentral to the change was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. On average, Americans were gaining sexual experience before entering into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation.<ref name=GLBTQ /> By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was acceptable, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and as well less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\nThe idea of marriage being outdated came from the development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every known sexually transmitted disease was readily treatable.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\n[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinger clubs]] were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that offered a range of [[Extramarital sex|sexual possibilities with multiple partners]]. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened [[Plato's Retreat]], which eventually shut down in 1985 under regular close scrutiny by public health authorities.<ref name=\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nFraenkel (1992) believes that the \"sexual revolution\", which the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is a misconception / misnomer, and that sex is never actually enjoyed freely as such, being rather ''observed'' in all fields of culture: a stance adopted toward human behaviour referable to the concept of \"[[repressive desublimation]]\". According to this concept or interpretation (first evolved by [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]), the 'sexual revolution' would be an instance of a conservative force masquerading under the guise of liberation - a force sapping energies (here sexual) which would otherwise be available for a true social [[critique]] of a given behaviour - and thus an impediment to any real political change which might emancipate the individual from \"[[totalitarian democracy]]\". (See also [[Bread and circuses]], [[False consciousness]] and [[Frankfurt School]]). Put baldly, the pursuit of \"sexual freedom\" may be construed as a distraction from the pursuit of ''actual'' freedom.{{sfn|Marcuse|1964|pp=59, 75\u201382}}\n\nAllyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of [[herpes]] escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.<ref name=\"allyn\"/>{{page needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAmong [[radical feminists]], the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.<ref name=\"Willis 1984 121\"/> In ''[[Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution]]'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.<ref name=\"Zoftig 1982 88\"/><ref name=\"Vance 1992 302\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert\"/><ref name=\"Denfeld 1995 35\"/> In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].\n\nAlthough the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of [[teenage pregnancy]] in developed nations such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |title=Resource Library |accessdate=2011-07-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135322/http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |archivedate=2011-09-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Teenage pregnancies at lowest level since 1980s | date=2011-02-23 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627003556/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | archivedate=2012-06-27 }}</ref> For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States.

It stars [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Jermaine Fowler]], [[Omari Hardwick]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[David Cross]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Steven Yeun]], and [[Armie Hammer]]. The film follows a young [[African American|black]] telemarketer who adopts a [[acting white|white accent]] to succeed at his job. Swept into a corporate conspiracy, he must choose between profit and joining his activist friends to [[labor union|organize labor]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in June 2017 in Oakland. ''Sorry to Bother You'' premiered at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on January 20, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 6, 2018, by [[Annapurna Pictures]]. The film received praise for its cast and concept, as well as Riley's screenplay and direction.\n\n==Plot==\nCassius \"Cash\" Green lives in his uncle Sergio's garage with his girlfriend, Detroit, an artist. Struggling to pay rent, Cash gets a job as a telemarketer for RegalView. Cash has trouble talking to customers until Langston, an older co-worker, teaches him to use his \"[[Acting white|white voice]]\", at which Cash excels.\n\nCash's coworker Squeeze forms a [[Trade union|union]] and recruits Cash, Detroit, and their friend Sal. When Cash participates in a protest, he expects to be fired but is instead promoted to an elite Power Caller position. In the luxurious Power Caller suite, Cash is told always to use his white voice, and learns that RegalView secretly sells arms and slave labor from the corporation WorryFree.\n\nThough Cash is initially uncomfortable with the job, he can now afford a new car and apartment and pays off Sergio's house (in the process keeping him from joining WorryFree) and his own rent. Working long hours, he stops participating in the union push and his relationship with Detroit deteriorates. When Cash crosses the [[Picketing|union's picket line]], one of the picketers hits him with a can of soda. Footage of the incident becomes an [[Internet meme]].\n\nCash is invited to a party with WorryFree CEO Steve Lift, where he is goaded into rapping. Lift offers Cash a powdered substance which Cash snorts, believing it is cocaine. Looking for the bathroom, Cash discovers a shackled half-horse, half-human hybrid who begs him for help. Lift explains that WorryFree plans to make their workers stronger and more obedient by transforming them into \"equisapiens\". The transformation occurs when a human snorts a gene-modifying powder. Cash fears he just snorted the substance, but Lift assures him it was cocaine. Cash refuses a $100-million offer over five years to become an equisapien and act as a false revolutionary figure to keep the employees in line.\n\nCash discovers he dropped his phone when he encountered the equisapien, who recorded a plea for help and sent it to Detroit's phone. To spread the video, Cash appears on television shows, including the extremely popular ''I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me'', enduring humiliations and beatings to get the video played. The plan backfires. The equisapiens are hailed as a groundbreaking scientific advancement, and WorryFree's stock reaches an all-time high. Cash apologizes to Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit, and joins the union in a final stand against RegalView.\n\nCash uses a security code from the equisapien's video to break into Lift's home. He goes to the picket line, where the police start a riot and knock him out. The equisapiens overpower the police and free Cash. Detroit and Cash reconcile and move back into Sergio's garage, but Cash starts to grow horse nostrils. Fully transformed, he leads a mob of equisapiens to Lift's house and breaks down the door.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Cassius \"Cash\" Green\n** [[David Cross]] as Cash's \"white voice\"\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Detroit, Cash\u2019s girlfriend\n** [[Lily James]] as Detroit\u2019s white voice\n* [[Jermaine Fowler]] as Salvador\n* [[Omari Hardwick]] as Mr. _______\n** [[Patton Oswalt]] as Mr. _______'s white voice\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Sergio Green, Cash's uncle\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Langston\n* [[Steven Yeun]] as Squeeze\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Steve Lift \n* [[Kate Berlant]] as Diana DeBauchery\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as First Equisapien/Demarius\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Voice in Power Caller Elevator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Boots Riley 20160118-1099.jpg|thumb|Riley speaks at a [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] rally in [[Emeryville, California]], January 2016.]]\nBoots Riley describes the film as \"an absurdist dark comedy with aspects of [[magical realism]] and science fiction inspired by the world of telemarketing\".

It stars [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Jermaine Fowler]], [[Omari Hardwick]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[David Cross]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Steven Yeun]], and [[Armie Hammer]]. The film follows a young [[African American|black]] telemarketer who adopts a [[acting white|white accent]] to succeed at his job. Swept into a corporate conspiracy, he must choose between profit and joining his activist friends to [[labor union|organize labor]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in June 2017 in Oakland. ''Sorry to Bother You'' premiered at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on January 20, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 6, 2018, by [[Annapurna Pictures]]. The film received praise for its cast and concept, as well as Riley's screenplay and direction.\n\n==Plot==\nCassius \"Cash\" Green lives in his uncle Sergio's garage with his girlfriend, Detroit, an artist. Struggling to pay rent, Cash gets a job as a telemarketer for RegalView. Cash has trouble talking to customers until Langston, an older co-worker, teaches him to use his \"[[Acting white|white voice]]\", at which Cash excels.\n\nCash's coworker Squeeze forms a [[Trade union|union]] and recruits Cash, Detroit, and their friend Sal. When Cash participates in a protest, he expects to be fired but is instead promoted to an elite Power Caller position. In the luxurious Power Caller suite, Cash is told always to use his white voice, and learns that RegalView secretly sells arms and slave labor from the corporation WorryFree.\n\nThough Cash is initially uncomfortable with the job, he can now afford a new car and apartment and pays off Sergio's house (in the process keeping him from joining WorryFree) and his own rent. Working long hours, he stops participating in the union push and his relationship with Detroit deteriorates. When Cash crosses the [[Picketing|union's picket line]], one of the picketers hits him with a can of soda. Footage of the incident becomes an [[Internet meme]].\n\nCash is invited to a party with WorryFree CEO Steve Lift, where he is goaded into rapping. Lift offers Cash a powdered substance which Cash snorts, believing it is cocaine. Looking for the bathroom, Cash discovers a shackled half-horse, half-human hybrid who begs him for help. Lift explains that WorryFree plans to make their workers stronger and more obedient by transforming them into \"equisapiens\". The transformation occurs when a human snorts a gene-modifying powder. Cash fears he just snorted the substance, but Lift assures him it was cocaine. Cash refuses a $100-million offer over five years to become an equisapien and act as a false revolutionary figure to keep the employees in line.\n\nCash discovers he dropped his phone when he encountered the equisapien, who recorded a plea for help and sent it to Detroit's phone. To spread the video, Cash appears on television shows, including the extremely popular ''I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me'', enduring humiliations and beatings to get the video played. The plan backfires. The equisapiens are hailed as a groundbreaking scientific advancement, and WorryFree's stock reaches an all-time high. Cash apologizes to Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit, and joins the union in a final stand against RegalView.\n\nCash uses a security code from the equisapien's video to break into Lift's home. He goes to the picket line, where the police start a riot and knock him out. The equisapiens overpower the police and free Cash. Detroit and Cash reconcile and move back into Sergio's garage, but Cash starts to grow horse nostrils. Fully transformed, he leads a mob of equisapiens to Lift's house and breaks down the door.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Cassius \"Cash\" Green\n** [[David Cross]] as Cash's \"white voice\"\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Detroit, Cash\u2019s girlfriend\n** [[Lily James]] as Detroit\u2019s white voice\n* [[Jermaine Fowler]] as Salvador\n* [[Omari Hardwick]] as Mr. _______\n** [[Patton Oswalt]] as Mr. _______'s white voice\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Sergio Green, Cash's uncle\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Langston\n* [[Steven Yeun]] as Squeeze\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Steve Lift \n* [[Kate Berlant]] as Diana DeBauchery\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as First Equisapien/Demarius\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Voice in Power Caller Elevator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Boots Riley 20160118-1099.jpg|thumb|Riley speaks at a [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] rally in [[Emeryville, California]], January 2016.]]\nBoots Riley describes the film as \"an absurdist dark comedy with aspects of [[magical realism]] and science fiction inspired by the world of telemarketing\".

Physical abuse may include threats or attempts to kill the cohabitant.

As mentioned earlier, the abuser may prevent the victim from working or make it very difficult to maintain a job.  They may likewise impede their ability to obtain an education.  Frequent phone calls, surprise visits and other harassing activities interfere with the cohabitant's work performance.

In some cases the abuser may withhold those necessities, also including medicine and personal hygiene products. They may also greatly limit their ability to leave the abusive situation by refusing to pay court-ordered spousal or child support.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\nAbusers may also force their victims to obtain credit and then through negligent activities ruin their credit rating and ability to get credit.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\n===Managing economic abuse===\nThere are several ways to manage economic abuse: ensure one has safe access to important personal and financial records, ensure one's research activities are not traceable and, if they believe that they are going to leave the cohabitation, they should prepare ahead of time.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\n==Role in elder abuse==\n{{main article|Elder financial abuse}}\n\nThe elderly are sometimes victims of financial abuse from people within their family:\n* Money or property is used without their permission or taken from them. \n* Their signature is forged for financial transactions. \n*\n* Coerced or influenced into signing over deeds, wills, or power of attorney.\n* Deceived into believing that money is exchanged for the promise of lifelong care.<ref name=\"NCPEA\">[http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html ''Financial Abuse.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126111044/http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html |date=2011-11-26 }} National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (NCPEA). 2008.

It is common for the victim to receive less and less money as the abuse continues. This also includes (but is not limited to) preventing the victim from finishing [[education]] or obtaining [[employment]], or intentionally squandering or misusing communal resources.<ref>\"Economic Abuse\". BSAFE. September 6, 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Controlling mechanism===\nEconomic abuse is often used as a [[Abusive power and control|controlling mechanism]] as part of a larger pattern of domestic abuse, which may include [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]]. Physical abuse may include threats or attempts to kill the cohabitant. By restricting the victim's access to economic resources, the offender has limited recourses to exit the abusive or violent relationship.<ref name=wdachoices>[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

Retrieved November 20, 2011.</ref>\n\n===Job-related impacts===\nThere are several ways that abusers may impact a victim's economic resources.  As mentioned earlier, the abuser may prevent the victim from working or make it very difficult to maintain a job.  They may likewise impede their ability to obtain an education.  Frequent phone calls, surprise visits and other harassing activities interfere with the cohabitant's work performance. In case of a cohabitant being homosexual, bisexual, transgender, or questioning of their sexuality ([[LGBTQ]]), the abuser may threaten to \"out them\" with their employer.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\nThe [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] in the [[United States]] reports that:\n* 25\u201350% of victims of abuse from a partner have lost their job due to domestic violence.\n* 35\u201356% of victims of domestic violence are harassed at work by their partners.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\n===Impact of lack of economic resources===\nBy denying the victim access to money, such as forbidding the victim from maintaining a bank account, he or she is totally financially dependent upon the abuser for shelter, food, clothing and other necessities.  In some cases the abuser may withhold those necessities, also including medicine and personal hygiene products. They may also greatly limit their ability to leave the abusive situation by refusing to pay court-ordered spousal or child support.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\nAbusers may also force their victims to obtain credit and then through negligent activities ruin their credit rating and ability to get credit.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\n===Managing economic abuse===\nThere are several ways to manage economic abuse: ensure one has safe access to important personal and financial records, ensure one's research activities are not traceable and, if they believe that they are going to leave the cohabitation, they should prepare ahead of time.<ref name=ncadv/>\n\n==Role in elder abuse==\n{{main article|Elder financial abuse}}\n\nThe elderly are sometimes victims of financial abuse from people within their family:\n* Money or property is used without their permission or taken from them. \n* Their signature is forged for financial transactions. \n*\n* Coerced or influenced into signing over deeds, wills or power of attorney.\n* Deceived into believing that money is exchanged for the promise of lifelong care.<ref name=\"NCPEA\">[http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html ''Financial Abuse.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126111044/http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html |date=2011-11-26 }} National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (NCPEA). 2008.

They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of \"entitlement\" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person.  Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses.

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters played by [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]] at a [[community college]] in the fictional town of Greendale, [[Colorado]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He enrolls at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his [[Activism|activist]] classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her.\n\nHowever, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a [[popular culture|pop culture]]-lover with [[Asperger syndrome]], who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious [[Single parent|single mother]]; [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] [[Overachievement|over-achiever]] Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.\n\nWhile taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their [[Mental disorder|unstable]] teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason 1 follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season 2 continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season 3, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal conservative [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nEach episode of ''Community'' is written in accordance with [[Dan Harmon]]'s template of \"story circles\" that he developed while at [[Channel 101]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/|title=How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Making Community|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=September 22, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=May 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516155548/http://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon|archive-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This writing method was continued through the fourth season without him.

Screen]] from September 17, 2009, to June 2, 2015. The series follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters played by [[Joel McHale]], [[Gillian Jacobs]], [[Danny Pudi]], [[Yvette Nicole Brown]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Jim Rash]] at a [[community college]] in the fictional town of Greendale, [[Colorado]]. It makes heavy use of [[Meta-joke|meta-humor]] and [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Meta-reference|references]], often parodying film and television clich\u00e9s and [[trope (literature)|tropes]].\n\nHarmon based the program on his own experiences attending a community college. Each episode was written in accordance with Harmon's \"story circle\" template, a method designed to create effective, structured storytelling. Harmon served as the series' [[showrunner]] for its first three seasons, but was fired prior to the fourth and replaced by writers David Guarascio and Moses Port. After a lukewarm response to the fourth season from fans and critics, Harmon was re-hired for the show's fifth broadcast season, after which it was canceled by NBC. Yahoo! Screen commissioned its sixth and final season, which concluded on June 2, 2015.\n\n''Community'' received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics' year-end \"best-of\" lists for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, and developed a [[cult following]].\n\n==Premise==\nJeff Winger is [[disbarred]] and suspended from his law firm when it is discovered that he lied about possessing a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Columbia University]]. He enrolls at Greendale Community College to earn a legitimate degree. Jeff quickly becomes attracted to his [[Activism|activist]] classmate, Britta Perry, and pretends to run a [[study group]] in order to spend time with her.\n\nHowever, things don't go to plan when she invites Abed Nadir, a [[popular culture|pop culture]]-lover with [[Asperger syndrome]], who brings other classmates along: Shirley Bennett, a highly religious [[Single parent|single mother]]; [[Naivety|na\u00efve]] [[Overachievement|over-achiever]] Annie Edison; former high school football star Troy Barnes; and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] elderly millionaire Pierce Hawthorne. Despite their differences, the members of the group soon become close friends.\n\nWhile taking select classes together semester after semester, the group members are often roped into helping the college's flamboyant Dean, Craig Pelton, in his schemes to make the school seem more respectable, as well as having to deal with the antics of their [[Mental disorder|unstable]] teacher (and eventual classmate) Ben Chang.\n\nSeason one follows Jeff's creation of the study group and their subsequent misadventures. Season two continues their second year at Greendale. Chang is forced to enroll as a student and tries to join the study group, while secretly planning revenge against them. Meanwhile, Dean Pelton is forced to fight for Greendale's sense of pride against Dean Spreck of rival school City College, eventually culminating in a desperate paintball battle. In season three, the school is threatened by Chang, who puts together a villainous plot to take over the school. Troy also must struggle with whether or not to attend the cult-like Air-Conditioning Repair School.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Community characters}}\nThe show features an [[ensemble cast]] of characters, focusing on the members of a study group and a recurring group of faculty of Greendale Community College, including the dean.\n\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Jeff Winger, a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the [[State bar association|state bar]] for falsely claiming to have a [[bachelor's degree]]. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, [[narcissistic|narcissist]] [[lothario]] who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. He is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other [[alpha (ethology)|alpha-males]] typically offer.\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Britta Perry, an [[anarchist]], [[atheist]], and [[Activism|activist]] who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta puts forth a strong effort to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she usually just comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a [[therapist]]. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta does have a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Abed Nadir, a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via normal means, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV [[clich\u00e9s]]. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Shirley Bennett (main cast, seasons 1\u20135; recurring, season 6), a single mother and vocal [[Christianity|Christian]] going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is seen as the \"mother\" of the group, but she can often be overbearing in her desire to help and guide her friends. Despite having a hot temper and starting the series off as being apprehensive towards different religious views or lack thereof, Shirley is a very kind-hearted person with a strong set of morals.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Annie Edison, the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively [[Ingenue (stock character)|innocent]]. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to [[Adderall]], which has caused her to be very [[Generalised anxiety disorder|anxious]] and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. She is normally genial and laid-back, but can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about, even if it's about something as simple as a pen.\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Troy Barnes (seasons 1\u20135), a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but because of the influence of Abed (who quickly becomes his best friend), he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his [[nerd]]y and carefree side.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ben Chang, an extremely unstable teacher at Greendale. Chang's insanity often leads him to take extreme action for no apparent reason and he has alternatively been a friend and foe of the study group.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Pierce Hawthorne (main cast, seasons 1\u20134; guest, season 5), a millionaire who enrolls at Greendale out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the study group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy and casual narrow-mindedness. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, partly due to his own family's emotionally distant and dysfunctional relationship with him.\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Craig Pelton (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main cast, seasons 3\u20136), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions.

Though initially not partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded by the quality of the show's writing to take the job.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\"<ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web|url=https://avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=September 19, 2009|work=[[The A.V.

Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known for her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n[[File:Dan Harmon (14790686643).jpg|thumb|175px|left|Series creator Dan Harmon]]\n\n===Development===\nHarmon based the premise of ''Community'' on his own real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together.<ref name=\"OWH\"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. \"I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them,\" he explains, \"even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them.\"<ref name=\"AV\"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\nAbout the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic.<ref name=\"AV\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nEach episode of ''Community'' is written in accordance with [[Dan Harmon]]'s template of \"story circles\" that he developed while at [[Channel 101]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon/|title=How Dan Harmon Drives Himself Crazy Making Community|last=Raftery|first=Brian|date=September 22, 2011|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=May 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516155548/http://www.wired.com/2011/09/mf_harmon|archive-date=May 16, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> This writing method was continued through the fourth season without him.

The film first aired on [[NBC]] as a two-part special on October 14 and October 21, 1978. The film has the characters finally being rescued after 15 years on the island. The film was directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]].<ref name=\"Rescue from Gilligan's Island\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/476795/Reluctant-Heroes-The/full-credits.html|title=Rescue from Gilligan's Island|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2010}}\nThe story picks up 15 years after the original shipwreck. Gilligan has a nightmare about the island melting. The film then notes that far away from Gilligan's Island in an unidentified country (one may assume the Soviet Union), a military unit is monitoring a satellite that is experiencing technical problems. The scientists controlling the satellite activate a self-destruct mechanism to prevent the satellite from crashing to Earth, as it contains a disc that holds some very important, top-secret information. The metal disc from the satellite is not destroyed, instead making it through the Earth's atmosphere and landing at the lagoon, eventually being found by Gilligan.\n\nThe Professor realizes that a unique alloy in the disc can be used to make a [[barometer]] enabling him to predict the weather for the first time since their radio finally gave out. While using the new barometer, the Professor deduces that they are going to be hit by a tsunami of such magnitude that it will destroy the island. To survive the killer wave and potentially effect a rescue, the Professor has the castaways maneuver three of their huts together and secure them to one another, hoping their makeshift raft will be swept into the shipping lanes.\n\nWhen the castaways awaken the next morning, they realize that the Professor's prediction has come true; they have been swept off the island on their makeshift raft. Gilligan makes a fire on the deck to cook a fish, and leaves the fire unattended. Unfortunately for Gilligan, the fire begins to spread out of control, but the other castaways promptly extinguish it. After being angry at Gilligan, the castaways are then grateful when the [[United States Coast Guard]] spots the smoke and rescues them.\n\nAfter the raft is towed to Hawaii, the castaways' names are announced to the anxious crowds. Most of the cast's full names are recited, but a bullhorn obscures part of the first mate's name, and all that is heard is \"Gilligan\". The castaways are at first confused by modern life. After a ton of hoopla and media hype, the group agrees to meet again at Christmas aboard the S.S. ''Minnow II''.\n\nAfter viewing an interview of the castaways on TV, spies from the unknown country are made aware that Gilligan is in possession of the recording disc from their satellite and are sent to recover it.\n\nAn insurance company informs the Skipper and Gilligan that they will not get a settlement payment for the first ''Minnow'' unless their former passengers sign a statement testifying that the Skipper was not responsible for the shipwreck.\n\nFirst, they visit Ginger. She is making a movie, and is upset at the changes in [[Hollywood]] in the last 15 years. She is told that sex and swearing are what makes a movie successful, and that nothing else matters. The producer overhears Gilligan talking about some recent films he had seen which were hits, such as ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', neither of which had profanity nor bawdiness, and quickly decides that acting is what really matters. Ginger signs the insurance statement and the Skipper and Gilligan go off to find the Professor.\n\nThe Professor is trying to get back into research and is busying himself in his college lab conducting experiments, frustrated by the fact that many things he wanted to invent were already invented and that the school students and faculty are more interested in his celebrity status than his work. After a series of encounters with college cheerleaders, another faculty member and the college dean, the Professor signs the insurance statement.  While leaving the campus the spies try, but fail, to secure the disk from Gilligan.\n\nGilligan and the Skipper then go to meet the Howells. They are having dinner with old friends and are delighted when the Skipper and Gilligan arrive. The Howells introduce them to their acquaintances before going into the library to discuss matters. Over the intercom, however, they overhear their rich \"friends\" making insults toward Gilligan and the Skipper. The Howells angrily eject their supposed friends (and incidentally the spies trying to recover the disk by claiming to be with those friends) from their property. The Howells then sign the insurance statement.\n\nThe Skipper and Gilligan go see Mary Ann. After 15 years, she is set to marry her fiance\u00e9, Herbert. She is sad, however, and Cindy, a childhood friend of Mary Ann's, tries to console her. Mary Ann explains that she and Herbert have both changed and she no longer loves him. Cindy says she should call off the wedding, but Mary Ann insists she must do the right thing and marry Herbert. Again unannounced, the Skipper and Gilligan show up looking for a signature for the insurance statement. Mary Ann is thrilled to see them but they notice she is unhappy. She brushes it off and asks them to stay for the wedding. Cindy confides her true feelings regarding Herbert, and his for her, to Gilligan and the Skipper. They decide that they must \"save\" Mary Ann from making a huge mistake. They grab a tractor pulling an old wagon laden with watermelons and proceed to \"scoop\" Mary Ann out of the arms of Herbert. Subsequently, the two spies (who happen to be in attendance no matter where Gilligan goes) and all the male guests begin running after the tractor and almost catch the threesome until Gilligan ingeniously hurls a single watermelon into the group and they tumble over like a \"[[Strike (bowling)|perfect strike]]\". Meanwhile, as Mary Ann contemplates how to break the news to Herbert without breaking his heart, in the background, the traditional [[wedding music]] starts playing. This time, Herbert and Cindy are getting married. Mary Ann is out of her predicament and the Skipper gets his insurance statement signed.\n\nEventually, the insurance company pays for the first ''Minnow'', and the castaways and crew are ready for a cruise on the ''Minnow II''. The spies make one last attempt to get the disc, but are thwarted at the last minute by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Finally, the cruise gets under way.\n\nJust as 15 years before, however, the ''Minnow II'' is caught in a storm, because while cleaning the [[compass]], Gilligan had rendered it useless by removing the magnet that makes the compass work, causing the Skipper to sail for hours in the wrong direction. When the storm finally subsides, the group is seen pulling themselves from the water onto a beach. After getting some not-so-happy looks from the rest of the gang, Gilligan runs into the jungle. Gilligan returns to say he knows where they are by showing the rest of the group a piece of wood from the original ''Minnow'' (the name plate of the original ship, which is incorrectly marked ''Minnow I''). The group react in shock when they realize they landed right back on the same island, and when Gilligan says \"we're home,\" the Skipper chases him into the lagoon.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]] - [[Bob Denver]]\n*[[The Skipper|Jonas \"The Skipper\" Grumby]] - [[Alan Hale Jr.|Alan Hale, Jr.]]\n*[[Thurston Howell III]] - [[Jim Backus]]\n*[[Lovey Howell|Mrs. \"Lovey\" Howell III]] - [[Natalie Schafer]]\n*[[Ginger Grant]] - [[Judith Baldwin]]\n*[[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|Professor Roy Hinkley]] - [[Russell Johnson]]\n*[[Mary Ann Summers]] - [[Dawn Wells]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Tina Louise]] declined to appear in the movie, claiming that she was not going to reprise the role that she felt had devastated her career. Reportedly she asked for a prohibitively large sum of money. [[Judith Baldwin]], a substantially younger actress who resembled Louise, was cast in her place. The following year, Baldwin would go on to play Ginger again in ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]''. [[Cassandra Peterson]] also auditioned for the part of 'Ginger,' shortly before [[KCAL-TV|KHJ-TV]] offered her the horror-host position as 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark'.\n\n==Release==\n''Rescue from Gilligan's Island'' aired in two parts on [[NBC]] on October 14 and 21, 1978.

Gilligan has a nightmare about the island melting. The film then notes that far away from Gilligan's Island in an unidentified country (one may assume the Soviet Union), a military unit is monitoring a satellite that is experiencing technical problems. The scientists controlling the satellite activate a self-destruct mechanism to prevent the satellite from crashing to Earth, as it contains a disc that holds some very important, top-secret information. The metal disc from the satellite is not destroyed, instead making it through the Earth's atmosphere and landing at the lagoon, eventually being found by Gilligan.\n\nThe Professor realizes that a unique alloy in the disc can be used to make a [[barometer]] enabling him to predict the weather for the first time since their radio finally gave out. While using the new barometer, the Professor deduces that they are going to be hit by a tsunami of such magnitude that it will destroy the island. To survive the killer wave and potentially effect a rescue, the Professor has the castaways maneuver three of their huts together and secure them to one another, hoping their makeshift raft will be swept into the shipping lanes.\n\nWhen the castaways awaken the next morning, they realize that the Professor's prediction has come true; they have been swept off the island on their makeshift raft. Gilligan makes a fire on the deck to cook a fish, and leaves the fire unattended. Unfortunately for Gilligan, the fire begins to spread out of control, but the other castaways promptly extinguish it. After being angry at Gilligan, the castaways are then grateful when the [[United States Coast Guard]] spots the smoke and rescues them.\n\nAfter the raft is towed to Hawaii, the castaways' names are announced to the anxious crowds. Most of the cast's full names are recited, but a bullhorn obscures part of the first mate's name, and all that is heard is \"Gilligan\". The castaways are at first confused by modern life. After a ton of hoopla and media hype, the group agrees to meet again at Christmas aboard the S.S. ''Minnow II''.\n\nAfter viewing an interview of the castaways on TV, spies from the unknown country are made aware that Gilligan is in possession of the recording disc from their satellite and are sent to recover it.\n\nAn insurance company informs the Skipper and Gilligan that they will not get a settlement payment for the first ''Minnow'' unless their former passengers sign a statement testifying that the Skipper was not responsible for the shipwreck.\n\nFirst, they visit Ginger. She is making a movie, and is upset at the changes in [[Hollywood]] in the last 15 years. She is told that sex and swearing are what makes a movie successful, and that nothing else matters. The producer overhears Gilligan talking about some recent films he had seen which were hits, such as ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', neither of which had profanity nor bawdiness, and quickly decides that acting is what really matters. Ginger signs the insurance statement and the Skipper and Gilligan go off to find the Professor.\n\nThe Professor is trying to get back into research and is busying himself in his college lab conducting experiments, frustrated by the fact that many things he wanted to invent were already invented and that the school students and faculty are more interested in his celebrity status than his work. After a series of encounters with college cheerleaders, another faculty member and the college dean, the Professor signs the insurance statement.  While leaving the campus the spies try, but fail, to secure the disk from Gilligan.\n\nGilligan and the Skipper then go to meet the Howells. They are having dinner with old friends and are delighted when the Skipper and Gilligan arrive. The Howells introduce them to their acquaintances before going into the library to discuss matters. Over the intercom, however, they overhear their rich \"friends\" making insults toward Gilligan and the Skipper. The Howells angrily eject their supposed friends (and incidentally the spies trying to recover the disk by claiming to be with those friends) from their property. The Howells then sign the insurance statement.\n\nThe Skipper and Gilligan go see Mary Ann. After 15 years, she is set to marry her fiance\u00e9, Herbert. She is sad, however, and Cindy, a childhood friend of Mary Ann's, tries to console her. Mary Ann explains that she and Herbert have both changed and she no longer loves him. Cindy says she should call off the wedding, but Mary Ann insists she must do the right thing and marry Herbert. Again unannounced, the Skipper and Gilligan show up looking for a signature for the insurance statement. Mary Ann is thrilled to see them but they notice she is unhappy. She brushes it off and asks them to stay for the wedding. Cindy confides her true feelings regarding Herbert, and his for her, to Gilligan and the Skipper. They decide that they must \"save\" Mary Ann from making a huge mistake. They grab a tractor pulling an old wagon laden with watermelons and proceed to \"scoop\" Mary Ann out of the arms of Herbert. Subsequently, the two spies (who happen to be in attendance no matter where Gilligan goes) and all the male guests begin running after the tractor and almost catch the threesome until Gilligan ingeniously hurls a single watermelon into the group and they tumble over like a \"[[Strike (bowling)|perfect strike]]\". Meanwhile, as Mary Ann contemplates how to break the news to Herbert without breaking his heart, in the background, the traditional [[wedding music]] starts playing. This time, Herbert and Cindy are getting married. Mary Ann is out of her predicament and the Skipper gets his insurance statement signed.\n\nEventually, the insurance company pays for the first ''Minnow'', and the castaways and crew are ready for a cruise on the ''Minnow II''. The spies make one last attempt to get the disc, but are thwarted at the last minute by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Finally, the cruise gets under way.\n\nJust as 15 years before, however, the ''Minnow II'' is caught in a storm, because while cleaning the [[compass]], Gilligan had rendered it useless by removing the magnet that makes the compass work, causing the Skipper to sail for hours in the wrong direction. When the storm finally subsides, the group is seen pulling themselves from the water onto a beach. After getting some not-so-happy looks from the rest of the gang, Gilligan runs into the jungle. Gilligan returns to say he knows where they are by showing the rest of the group a piece of wood from the original ''Minnow'' (the name plate of the original ship, which is incorrectly marked ''Minnow I''). The group react in shock when they realize they landed right back on the same island, and when Gilligan says \"we're home,\" the Skipper chases him into the lagoon.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]] - [[Bob Denver]]\n*[[The Skipper|Jonas \"The Skipper\" Grumby]] - [[Alan Hale Jr.|Alan Hale, Jr.]]\n*[[Thurston Howell III]] - [[Jim Backus]]\n*[[Lovey Howell|Mrs. \"Lovey\" Howell III]] - [[Natalie Schafer]]\n*[[Ginger Grant]] - [[Judith Baldwin]]\n*[[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|Professor Roy Hinkley]] - [[Russell Johnson]]\n*[[Mary Ann Summers]] - [[Dawn Wells]]\n\n==Production==\n[[Tina Louise]] declined to appear in the movie, claiming that she was not going to reprise the role that she felt had devastated her career. Reportedly she asked for a prohibitively large sum of money. [[Judith Baldwin]], a substantially younger actress who resembled Louise, was cast in her place. The following year, Baldwin would go on to play Ginger again in ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]''. [[Cassandra Peterson]] also auditioned for the part of 'Ginger,' shortly before [[KCAL-TV|KHJ-TV]] offered her the horror-host position as 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark'.\n\n==Release==\n''Rescue from Gilligan's Island'' aired in two parts on [[NBC]] on October 14 and 21, 1978. The made-for-TV-movie was released on [[DVD]] on January 1, 2002, August 1, 2012, June 23, 2015, and July 9, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rescue-Gilligans-Island-Bob-Denver/dp/B00005KHJF|title=Rescue from Gilligan's Island|work=[[Eclipse (company)|Eclipse]]|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=November 6, 2016|asin=B00005KHJF}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0078155|Rescue from Gilligan's Island}}\n*{{Internet Archive film|id=RescuefromGilligansIsland|name=Rescue from Gilligan's Island}}\n\n{{Gilligan's Island cast}}\n{{Leslie H.
