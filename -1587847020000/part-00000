As a future second phase, the Amsteltram will be extended to [[Uithoorn]]. The tram line replaces metro line 51 (a.k.a. the ''Amstelveenlijn''), a light rail line (''sneltram'') that ceased running on the 3 March 2019 to permit the renovation of the Amsteltram. The existing [[Tramlijn 5 (Amsterdam)|tram line 5]] shared the same tracks with metro line 51 between [[De Boelelaan/VU tram stop|De Boelelaan/VU]] and [[Oranjebaan tram stop|Oranjebaan]] stations, and continues to run with some bus replacement planned as the renovation progresses.<ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-Factsheet\"/> On 11 September 2019, the Amsteltram was given the line number 25 (''Tramlijn 25'').<ref name=\"Amsteltram-25\"/><ref name=\"ovpro-2019-09-11\"/>\n\nThe Amsteltram project website presents the route as two sections. The northern section, between [[Amsterdam Zuid station]] and Westwijk in [[Amstelveen]], retains the ''Amstelveenlijn'' name. The section south of Westwijk to Uithoorn, phase 2 of the project, is called the ''Uithoornlijn''. \n\n==Background==\nDubbed the Amstelveenlijn, Metro line 51 was a light-rail (''sneltram'') line that ran between [[Amsterdam Zuid station]] to Westwijk in Amstelveen from 1990 until March 2019. The tracks were shared with [[Tramlijn 5 (Amsterdam)|tram line 5]] roughly between [[De Boelelaan/VU metro station|De Boelelaan/VU]] and [[Oranjebaan tram stop|Oranjebaan]] stations.<ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-Factsheet\"/> There were bi-level platforms along the route: high-level platforms for metro line 51 and low-level for tram line 5. The tracks ran mainly along a reserved right-of-way in the middle of the street Beneluxbaan with street intersections controlled by traffic lights.<ref name=\"IRJ-Amstelveen-LRT\"/> \n\nAt Amsterdam Zuid station, light-rail trains had to change over from metro mode to tram mode. Heading south, a light-rail train would raise its pantograph, retract its third-rail shoes and switch voltage from 750V (metro) to 600V (light rail). Also, the train had to retract its boarding plates at each door as light-rail cars were narrower than metro cars.<ref name=\"IRJ-Amstelveen-LRT\"/>     \n\nLight-rail service was terminated because the light rail vehicles were old, crowded and prone to breakdowns. The change-over between metro and tram mode was a cause of many malfunctions as the vehicles aged.<ref name=\"IRJ-Amstelveen-LRT\"/> The design of the line was not ideal for safety,<ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-background\"/> often experiencing collisions. [[Gemeente Vervoerbedrijf|GVB]], the operator of the line, expects better reliability and safety after upgrading the line.<ref name=\"ovpro-2019-09-11\"/> \n\nThe cost of renovating the Amstelveen line is \u20ac300 million with the municipality of Amsterdam paying \u20ac225 million and the Dutch government paying the remaining \u20ac75 million. The estimated cost of the extension to Uithoorn (Uithoornlijn) is \u20ac60 million.<ref name=\"IRJ-Amstelveen-LRT\"/>\n\n==Amstelveenlijn conversion==\nThe following is a summary of the work needed to renovate the Amstelveenlijn, and convert it from light-rail to tram operation.<ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-Factsheet\"/>\n* Removal of high-level platforms.<ref name=\"IRJ-Amstelveen-LRT\"/>\n* Replacement or overhaul of tracks, power lines and technical systems.\n* Rebuilding 3 level crossings as underpasses along Beneluxbaan at [[Kronenburg metro station|Kronenburg]], [[Zonnestein metro station|Zonnestein]] and [[Sportlaan metro station|Sportlaan]].\n* Removal of 4 stops: [[Amstelveen Centrum metro station|Amstelveen Centrum]], [[Marne metro station|Marne]], [[Gondel metro station|Gondel]] and [[Spinnerij metro station|Spinnerij]]. \n* Removing the stops [[De Boelelaan/VU metro station|De Boelelaan/VU]] and [[A.J.Ernststraat metro station|A.J. Ernststraat]] stops and replacing them with a new intermediate stop.\n\nAt [[Amsterdam Zuid station]], the Amsteltram will terminate temporarily on Strawinskylaan on the north side of the railway station. However, as part of the separate Zuidasdok project (related to the renovation at the railway station), the terminus would be later relocated to a new tram station on Arnold Sch\u00f6nberglaan on the south side of the railway station.<ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-Zuid\"/>\n\nOn 9 March 2019, the new Kronenburg stop was opened. The stop is located in a pit below street level, and resembles a station with a centre platform and stairs leading up to street level. Bridges above the stop carry automobile traffic over the tram line via a [[roundabout]].<ref name=\"Nieuws-2020-01-10\"/><ref name=\"Nieuws-2020-03-29\"/> \n\n==Vehicles==\nThe Amsteltram will use low-floor trams (type 15G) manufactured in Spain by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles]] (CAF). The trams are bi-directional with a cab at each end of the car to eliminate the requirement for turning loops. Each tram consists of 5 sections, and is 30 metres long and 2.4 metres wide. The capacity of each tram is 180 passengers including 50 seated. Sixty-three of these trams have been ordered. The trams can be coupled to run in pairs. The nose at each end of the tram is shaped so that in the event of a collision, the tram pushes aside the other vehicle rather than trapping it under the tram.<ref name=\"Amsteltram-CAF\"/><ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-CAF\"/>\n\nA new tram depot is being constructed south of the Westwijk terminus in Legmeerpolder<ref name=\"IRJ-Amstelveen-LRT\"/> on the south side of J.C. van Hattumweg. The site will have a service building (''dienstgebouw'') for GVB personnel and a mixed-use building (''combinatiegebouw'') with a rectifier station to convert AC to DC, technical space for minor repairs and storage space.<ref name=\"Nieuws-2020-01-09\"/> Initially, the site will have storage for 26 trams with space for 10 more in future to handle the Uithoornlijn.<ref name=\"Nieuws-2020-01-16\"/> There will be 2,500 metres of track including 11 [[Railroad switch|turnouts]].<ref name=\"Nieuws-2020-01-22\"/> Construction started in September 2018 with a planned completion in the first quarter 2020.<ref name=\"Amstelveenlijn-Factsheet\"/>\n\n==Uithoornlijn extension==\nThe extension of the Amsteltram south to Uithoorn (the Uithoornlijn) will begin once the Amstelveenlijn is completed. The Uithoornlijn will be on the right-of-way of a railway line abandoned in 1950.
