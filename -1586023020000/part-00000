Much has been built around shared policies and capacity across the EU\". \"EU trade deals will not privatise the NHS as the EU negotiating position now contains clear safeguards.

His first single, \"[[String of Pain]]\", released on 6 February 2013, is the ending theme song to the [[anime]] ''[[Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East]]'' in which he also voices the main role of Shino Inuzuka.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kiramune.jp/artist/kakihara/disco.html|title= Tetsuya Kakihara's first single \"String of pain\"., release on February 6, 2013|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> He has released two full albums, five mini albums, and six singles.

Like other Japanese male voice actors, he is also active in [[Yaoi|BL (boys' love)]] Drama CDs and anime, and usually plays the ''uke'' part, like Akihito from ''[[Finder Series]]'', a work of popular boys love [[manga]] artist Ayano Yamane.\n\n==Biography==\nBefore becoming a voice actor, Kakihara had always longed to live in Japan. He was fascinated by entertainment culture; he thought Japan had funny television shows, and he has loved to read manga and watch anime since he was little.

His first single, \"[[String of Pain]]\", released on 6 February 2013, is the ending theme song to the [[anime]] ''[[Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East]]'' in which he also voices the main role of Shino Inuzuka.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kiramune.jp/artist/kakihara/disco.html|title= Tetsuya Kakihara's first single \"String of pain\"., release on February 6, 2013|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> He has released two full albums, five mini albums, and six singles.

Like other Japanese male voice actors, he is also active in [[Yaoi|BL (boys' love)]] Drama CDs and anime, and usually plays the ''uke'' part, like Akihito from ''[[Finder Series]]'', a work of popular boys love [[manga]] artist Ayano Yamane.\n\n==Biography==\nBefore becoming a voice actor, Kakihara had always longed to live in Japan. He was fascinated by entertainment culture; he thought Japan had funny television shows, and he has loved to read manga and watch anime since he was little.

At first, it was not a smooth road for him to get in, as the school was surprised he actually came all the way from Germany after receiving a prompt email from him 3 days prior.

It is unknown why the name \"Fernley\" was applied to this community.<ref>\n[http://www.cityoffernley.org/index.aspx?NID=349 Analysis of Fernley's name by Guy Rocha, Nevada State Archivist \u2013 as published on Official city website, snapshot 11/11/2014]</ref>\n\nMuch of the farmland in the Fernley area was developed through the Newlands Irrigation Project, which was a result of the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902. The project established an [[irrigation]] system that delivers water to an area stretching from [[Derby Dam]], along the [[Truckee River]], to the [[Lake Lahontan (reservoir)|Lahontan Reservoir]] near [[Fallon, Nevada]]. Construction and expansion of the system took place from the inception through the 1960s. Many of the concrete irrigation headgates, still in use today, are embossed with the CCC ([[Civilian Conservation Corps]]) stamp and date of construction. In addition to the irrigation system in the Fernley area, a drainage system was also constructed to carry away excess water and mineral salts from the farmlands. This system consists of channels ({{convert|5|to|15|ft}} deep) dug adjacent to fields; it eventually terminates in the [[sink (geography)|sink]] northeast of Fernley. The irrigation system is administered and maintained through the [[Truckee\u2013Carson Irrigation District]].\n\nUntil 1904, there was no place named \"Fernley\" in the area. It was not until the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] realigned its route through northwestern Nevada that the Fernley siding was created. Fernley first shows up as a station stop, but with no other services, on Southern Pacific employee timetables beginning with the June 19, 1904, edition (SP Salt Lake Division ETT No. 1). By September 3, 1905, Fernley is listed with a day and night [[telegraph]] office and [[wye (rail)|wye]] facilities. The descendants of the telegrapher James A. Galbraith, who arrived with his family in 1906, still reside in the region.\n\nIn the meantime, a community emerged and took the name Fernley. The general area was part of the fledgling Truckee-Carson Reclamation Project created by Congress in 1902 and later named the Canal District because of the newly created Truckee Canal connecting the Truckee River to the Lahontan Reservoir. Workers and settlers found their way to the western edge of the first federal reclamation project. On June 9, 1904, the Lyon County Commissioners created the Canal Township and appointed a [[constable]], Robert A. Benson, and a [[justice of the peace]], Edgar I. Parker, both men filing for homesteads in late 1903, according to records housed at the National Archives. In 1907 more settlers arrived and established homesteads.\n\nOn April 21, 1908, the Fernley post office opened. A public school also began operating in the 1908\u20131909 school year. According to the 1910 U.S. Census, 159 people lived in the Fernley area.<!--Many of the town's residents were active in the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]]--> Some were appointed postmaster, and others elected to the school board, the office of the Justice of the Peace, and the State Assembly.\n\nThe Southern Pacific Railroad completed the [[Fernley and Lassen Railway]] in 1914, and a suitable depot was constructed in Fernley. Residents welcomed the completion of the transcontinental [[Lincoln Highway|Lincoln/Victory Highways]] through town in the 1920s.\n\nThe town grew slowly & unpredictably at first. In 1960, only 654 people were enumerated in the U.S. Census. However, the population had more than doubled by 1970 with the construction of [[Interstate 80]] and the Nevada Cement Company opening its operation in 1963. By 1980, the population had more than doubled again. By the 1990s, the population had reached 5,164, and in 2000 the census counted 8,543 residents. The population more than doubled yet again over the next decade, reaching 19,368 by the 2010 census.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 1965, the Nevada [[Cement]] Company<ref>[http://www.nevadacement.com/ Untitled Document<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> started operation in a new plant built on the north side of the city between Fernley and [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]]. This was the first significant non-agricultural/ranching business to come to Fernley, aside from the railroad. Primary employment in Fernley began a steady transition to an industrial and commuter base continuing to the present time. Beginning in the 1970s, parts of the formerly agricultural and ranching-based lands were transitioning to [[housing subdivision]]s to support the growing population, much of which was spilling over from rapid growth in the Reno-Sparks area. Close proximity to Interstate 80 and abundant land for housing made Fernley an attractive alternative to the increasingly congested and expensive [[Truckee Meadows]] housing market. Beginning near the established parts of the town, growth moved to the Fremont Street area in the mid to late 1970s, nearer farming areas in the 1980s, and has continued along the Farm District Road areas to the present. Numerous subdivisions now exist along the Farm District Road, including an 18-hole golf course and a new elementary school.\n\nIn 1999, [[Amazon.com]] opened a {{Convert|750000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} order fulfillment center in the industrial park located in the northeast side of the city, following major initiatives and investments by investors from [[Seattle]]. Stanley Works had previously used the facility; Amazon.com redesigned the interior systems and greatly expanded the capacity in the years since. The investment has provided thousands of new jobs for the city and invigorated the economy in the metropolitan area. Since that time, more companies have opened facilities in the park, including Trex Inc., Allied Signal, UPS Worldwide Logistics (Honeywell), ARE Campers, Johns Manville, and Sherwin Williams Paint.<ref>[http://www.cityoffernley.org/ Fernley, NV \u2013 Official Website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2001, the city of Fernley was incorporated.\n\nFernley is home to [[Fernley High School]].<ref>[http://www.fhs.lyon.k12.nv.us/ Welcome to Fernley High School<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140558/http://www.fhs.lyon.k12.nv.us/ |date=April 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFernley High School has extensive athletic programs, program centers and student clubs.

It is unknown why the name \"Fernley\" was applied to this community.<ref>\n[http://www.cityoffernley.org/index.aspx?NID=349 Analysis of Fernley's name by Guy Rocha, Nevada State Archivist \u2013 as published on Official city website, snapshot 11/11/2014]</ref>\n\nMuch of the farmland in the Fernley area was developed through the Newlands Irrigation Project, which was a result of the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902. The project established an [[irrigation]] system that delivers water to an area stretching from [[Derby Dam]], along the [[Truckee River]], to the [[Lake Lahontan (reservoir)|Lahontan Reservoir]] near [[Fallon, Nevada]]. Construction and expansion of the system took place from the inception through the 1960s. Many of the concrete irrigation headgates, still in use today, are embossed with the CCC ([[Civilian Conservation Corps]]) stamp and date of construction. In addition to the irrigation system in the Fernley area, a drainage system was also constructed to carry away excess water and mineral salts from the farmlands. This system consists of channels ({{convert|5|to|15|ft}} deep) dug adjacent to fields; it eventually terminates in the [[sink (geography)|sink]] northeast of Fernley. The irrigation system is administered and maintained through the [[Truckee\u2013Carson Irrigation District]].\n\nUntil 1904, there was no place named \"Fernley\" in the area. It was not until the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] realigned its route through northwestern Nevada that the Fernley siding was created. Fernley first shows up as a station stop, but with no other services, on Southern Pacific employee timetables beginning with the June 19, 1904, edition (SP Salt Lake Division ETT No. 1). By September 3, 1905, Fernley is listed with a day and night [[telegraph]] office and [[wye (rail)|wye]] facilities. The descendants of the telegrapher James A. Galbraith, who arrived with his family in 1906, still reside in the region.\n\nIn the meantime, a community emerged and took the name Fernley. The general area was part of the fledgling Truckee-Carson Reclamation Project created by Congress in 1902 and later named the Canal District because of the newly created Truckee Canal connecting the Truckee River to the Lahontan Reservoir. Workers and settlers found their way to the western edge of the first federal reclamation project. On June 9, 1904, the Lyon County Commissioners created the Canal Township and appointed a [[constable]], Robert A. Benson, and a [[justice of the peace]], Edgar I. Parker, both men filing for homesteads in late 1903, according to records housed at the National Archives. In 1907 more settlers arrived and established homesteads.\n\nOn April 21, 1908, the Fernley post office opened. A public school also began operating in the 1908-1909 school year. According to the 1910 U.S. Census, 159 people lived in the Fernley area.<!--Many of the town's residents were active in the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]]--> Some were appointed postmaster, and others elected to the school board, the office of the Justice of the Peace, and the State Assembly.\n\nThe Southern Pacific Railroad completed the [[Fernley and Lassen Railway]] in 1914, and a suitable depot was constructed in Fernley. Residents welcomed the completion of the transcontinental [[Lincoln Highway|Lincoln/Victory Highways]] through town in the 1920s.\n\nThe town grew slowly & unpredictably at first. In 1960, only 654 people were enumerated in the U.S. Census. However, the population had more than doubled by 1970 with the construction of [[Interstate 80]] and the Nevada Cement Company opening its operation in 1963. By 1980, the population had more than doubled again. By the 1990s, the population had reached 5,164, and in 2000 the census counted 8,543 residents. The population more than doubled yet again over the next decade, reaching 19,368 by the 2010 census.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 1965, the Nevada [[Cement]] Company<ref>[http://www.nevadacement.com/ Untitled Document<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> started operation in a new plant built on the north side of the city between Fernley and [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]]. This was the first significant non-agricultural/ranching business to come to Fernley, aside from the railroad. Primary employment in Fernley began a steady transition to an industrial and commuter base continuing to the present time. Beginning in the 1970s, parts of the formerly agricultural and ranching-based lands were transitioning to [[housing subdivision]]s to support the growing population, much of which was spilling over from rapid growth in the Reno-Sparks area. Close proximity to Interstate 80 and abundant land for housing made Fernley an attractive alternative to the increasingly congested and expensive [[Truckee Meadows]] housing market. Beginning near the established parts of the town, growth moved to the Fremont Street area in the mid to late 1970s, nearer farming areas in the 1980s, and has continued along the Farm District Road areas to the present. Numerous subdivisions now exist along the Farm District Road, including an 18-hole golf course and a new elementary school.\n\nIn 1999, [[Amazon.com]] opened a {{Convert|750000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} order fulfillment center in the industrial park located in the northeast side of the city, following major initiatives and investments by investors from [[Seattle]]. Stanley Works had previously used the facility; Amazon.com redesigned the interior systems and greatly expanded the capacity in the years since. The investment has provided thousands of new jobs for the city and invigorated the economy in the metropolitan area. Since that time, more companies have opened facilities in the park, including Trex Inc., Allied Signal, UPS Worldwide Logistics (Honeywell), ARE Campers, Johns Manville, and Sherwin Williams Paint.<ref>[http://www.cityoffernley.org/ Fernley, NV \u2013 Official Website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2001, the city of Fernley was incorporated.\n\nFernley is home to [[Fernley High School]].<ref>[http://www.fhs.lyon.k12.nv.us/ Welcome to Fernley High School<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140558/http://www.fhs.lyon.k12.nv.us/ |date=April 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFernley High School has extensive athletic programs, program centers and student clubs.

Frontier began branding these flights as Frontier Express in the spring of 2011. With the pull-down of the Milwaukee hub, the only route that continued to operate with a Frontier Express ERJ-145 jet was Milwaukee to Rhinelander. However, Frontier service to Rhinelander ended on January 3, 2013, and Chautauqua transferred the remaining aircraft to other partners.\n\n=== Frontier JetExpress ===\nIn February 2002, the airline launched its first regional product, Frontier JetExpress, initially operated by '''[[Mesa Airlines]]''' using [[Bombardier CRJ100/200#CRJ200|CRJ-200]] regional jets. Similar to \"express\" operations of other carriers, Frontier JetExpress was targeted for markets to and from Denver that do not generate traffic sufficient to support Frontier's smallest mainline jet, the [[Airbus A318]], but could still offer lucrative business with a smaller jet.\n\nThe initial JetExpress partnership with Mesa ended in January 2004, when '''[[Horizon Air]]''' was selected to operate the routes. Horizon utilized slightly larger [[Bombardier CRJ700 series#CRJ700|CRJ-700]] regional jet aircraft on these routes. In August 2006, Frontier and Horizon ended their partnership.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_4370759| title=Frontier JetExpress ends| publisher=| accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref> While Frontier was generally pleased with Horizon's operation, the carrier decided that it needed to revisit the agreement and find a provider with additional regional jets to grow the operation. The last of the CRJ-700s was returned to the Horizon Air fleet on November 30, 2007.\n[[File:Frontierdenpedbridge.JPG|thumb| right| [[Denver International Airport]]'s Pedestrian Bridge, with many Frontier and [[Lynx Aviation]] aircraft in the foreground]]\n\n=== Lynx Aviation ===\n{{Main|Lynx Aviation}}\nOn September 6, 2006, Frontier created a new division of the holding company, known as [[Lynx Aviation]], to operate [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|Bombardier Q400]] aircraft beginning in May 2007.<ref name=dp1>{{cite news | last=Yamanouchi | first=Kelly | title=Frontier thinking small to go bigger | work=Denver Post | date=September 6, 2006 | accessdate=September 7, 2006 | url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_4297315}}</ref> On December 5, 2007, Lynx Aviation received its operating certificate from the FAA. Lynx began passenger operations on the morning of December 6, 2007.\n\nAfter commencing operations, Lynx added service to 12 regional destinations: Albuquerque, Aspen, Billings, Bozeman, Colorado Springs, Durango, Fargo, Jackson Hole (Seasonal), Oklahoma City, Rapid City, Tulsa, and Wichita. Two additional cities, Omaha and Salt Lake City, were served by Lynx Aviation along with Frontier Airlines mainline service.\n\nIn 2012, the Lynx Aviation operation was folded into Republic Airways Holdings subsidiary [[Republic Airlines]]. The remaining Q400 aircraft were withdrawn from Frontier service and placed in service for [[United Airlines]] flying as [[United Express]].\n\n=== Maverick Airways ===\nIn 1997, Maverick Airways was operating [[code share]] service for Frontier with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] [[STOL]] capable turboprops between Denver (DEN) and two destinations in Colorado: Grand Junction (GJT) and Steamboat Springs (SBS).<ref>Airways North American Airlines Handbook, 1997 edition, Maverick Airways</ref> However, the service was short lived as Maverick encountered financial challenges and then ceased all flights.\n\n==Corporate affairs==\n=== Business trends ===\nThe key trends for Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. over recent years are shown below (as at year ending December 31):\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" |\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2007*<br /><small>'''Mar'''</small></span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2008*<br /><small>'''Mar'''</small></span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2009*<br /><small>'''Mar'''</small></span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2010</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2011</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2012</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2013</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2014</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2015</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2016</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2017</span>\n! style=\"background: #006643;\" | <span style=\"color:white;\">2018</span>\n|-\n| Turnover (US$m)\n| align=center| 1,171\n| align=center| 1,399\n| align=center| 1,289\n| align=center| 1,317\n| align=center| 1,662\n| align=center| 1,433\n| align=center| 1,349\n| align=center| 1,575\n| align=center| 1,604\n| align=center| 1,714\n| align=center| 1,915\n! align=center| 2,156\n|-\n| Net profit (US$m)\n| align=center| {{color|red|&minus;20}}\n| align=center| {{color|red|&minus;60}}\n| align=center| {{color|red|&minus;248}}\n| align=center| \n| align=center| \n| align=center| 17\n| align=center| \n| align=center| 140\n| align=center| 146\n| align=center| 200\n| align=center| \n! align=center| \n|-\n| Number of employees ([[Full-time equivalent|FTE]])\n| align=center| 4,800\n| align=center| 5,200\n| align=center| 4,400\n| align=center| \n| align=center| \n| align=center| \n| align=center| 3,614\n| align=center| 3,653\n| align=center| 2,981\n| align=center| 3,163\n| align=center| \n! align=center| \n|-\n| Number of passengers (m)\n| align=center| 10.0\n| align=center| 12.0\n| align=center| 11.4\n| align=center| \n| align=center| \n| align=center| 10.7\n| align=center| 10.8\n| align=center| 12.2\n| align=center| 13.2\n| align=center| 14.9\n| align=center| \n! align=center| \n|-\n| Passenger load factor (%)\n| align=center| 75.2\n| align=center| 79.6\n| align=center| 80.4\n| align=center| \n| align=center| \n| align=center| 88.8\n| align=center| 90.6\n| align=center| 90.4\n| align=center| 88.0\n| align=center| 87.2\n| align=center| \n! align=center| \n|-\n| Number of aircraft (mainline) (at year end)\n| align=center| 57\n| align=center| 62\n| align=center| 51\n| align=center| \n| align=center| \n| align=center| 55\n| align=center| 52\n| align=center| 54\n| align=center| 61\n| align=center| 66\n| align=center| \n! align=center| \n|-\n| <small>''Notes/sources''<br>* [[Year-ending|Year ending]] March 31</small>\n| align=center|<ref name=\"10K2007\">{{cite web|title= Frontier Airlines Holdings, Inc.

The new livery reintroduced a green \"FRONTIER\" typeface to the fuselage, featuring the stylized \"F\" designed by [[Saul Bass]] for the original Frontier in 1978. Each aircraft features the name of the animal featured on its tail near the nose of the aircraft for easier identification. Currently about twenty five aircraft in the Frontier fleet feature the new livery.\n\nAnimal concepts used in the livery extend into Frontier's marketing as well.

Frontier began branding these flights as Frontier Express in the spring of 2011. With the pull-down of the Milwaukee hub, the only route that continued to operate with a Frontier Express ERJ-145 jet was Milwaukee to Rhinelander. However, Frontier service to Rhinelander ended on January 3, 2013, and Chautauqua transferred the remaining aircraft to other partners.\n\n=== Frontier JetExpress ===\nIn February 2002, the airline launched its first regional product, Frontier JetExpress, initially operated by '''[[Mesa Airlines]]''' using [[Bombardier CRJ100/200#CRJ200|CRJ-200]] regional jets. Similar to \"express\" operations of other carriers, Frontier JetExpress was targeted for markets to and from Denver that do not generate traffic sufficient to support Frontier's smallest mainline jet, the [[Airbus A318]], but could still offer lucrative business with a smaller jet.\n\nThe initial JetExpress partnership with Mesa ended in January 2004, when '''[[Horizon Air]]''' was selected to operate the routes. Horizon utilized slightly larger [[Bombardier CRJ700 series#CRJ700|CRJ-700]] regional jet aircraft on these routes. In August 2006, Frontier and Horizon ended their partnership.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_4370759| title=Frontier JetExpress ends| publisher=| accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref> While Frontier was generally pleased with Horizon's operation, the carrier decided that it needed to revisit the agreement and find a provider with additional regional jets to grow the operation.

The growth of the film society movement in Kerala introduced the works of the French and Italian New Wave directors to the discerning Malayali film enthusiasts. [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]'s first film, ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), brought Malayalam cinema to the international film arena. In 1973 [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], who was by then recognized as an important author in Malayalam, directed his first film, ''[[Nirmalyam]]'', which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]].\n\n[[G. Aravindan]] followed [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan|Adoor]]'s lead with his ''[[Uttarayanam]]'' in 1974. [[K. P. Kumaran]]'s ''Adhithi'' (1974) was another film which was acclaimed by the critics. [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematographers who won the National Award]] for their work on Malayalam films in the 1970s were [[Mankada Ravi Varma]] for ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), [[P.

Panikkar were products of the [[Pune Film Institute]].\nThe 1970s also saw the emergence of the notable director [[P. G. Viswambharan]] with his debut film ''Ozhukinethire'' and mythical film ''Sathyavan Savithri'', which was well accepted.\n\nAlso, commercial cinema in this period saw several worker-class themed films which mostly had [[M. G. Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Sudheer (Malayalam actor)|Sudheer]] in the lead followed by the emergence of a new genre of pure action-themed films, in a movement led by action star [[Jayan]] who is usually considered the first genuine commercial superstar of Malayalam cinema. However, this was short-lived, and almost ended with Jayan's untimely death while performing a [[stunt]] in ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (1980).\n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Priyadarshan at a press conference for \u2018Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal\u2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Priyadarshan]]]]\nThe Malayalam cinema of this period was characterised by detailed [[screenplay]]s dealing with everyday life with a lucid narration of plot intermingling with humour and melancholy. This was aided by the [[cinematography]] and lighting. The films had warm background music. In 1981 Fazil directed Manjil Virinja Pookal the film also introduced superstar [[Mohanlal]] to the world. [[K. G. George]] released films including  ''[[Yavanika]]'' (1982), and ''[[Adaminte Vaariyellu]]'' (1984).\n\nThis was the period during which script writer [[M. T.

The growth of the film society movement in Kerala introduced the works of the French and Italian New Wave directors to the discerning Malayali film enthusiasts. [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]'s first film, ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), brought Malayalam cinema to the international film arena. In 1973 [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], who was by then recognized as an important author in Malayalam, directed his first film, ''[[Nirmalyam]]'', which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]].\n\n[[G. Aravindan]] followed [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan|Adoor]]'s lead with his ''[[Uttarayanam]]'' in 1974. [[K. P. Kumaran]]'s ''Adhithi'' (1974) was another film which was acclaimed by the critics. [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematographers who won the National Award]] for their work on Malayalam films in the 1970s were [[Mankada Ravi Varma]] for ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), [[P.

G. Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Sudheer (Malayalam actor)|Sudheer]] in the lead followed by the emergence of a new genre of pure action-themed films, in a movement led by action star [[Jayan]] who is usually considered the first genuine commercial superstar of Malayalam cinema. However, this was short-lived, and almost ended with Jayan's untimely death while performing a [[stunt]] in ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (1980).\n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Priyadarshan at a press conference for \u2018Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal\u2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Priyadarshan]]]]\nThe Malayalam cinema of this period was characterised by detailed [[screenplay]]s dealing with everyday life with a lucid narration of plot intermingling with humour and melancholy. This was aided by the [[cinematography]] and lighting. The films had warm background music. In 1981 Fazil directed Manjil Virinja Pookal the film also introduced superstar [[Mohanlal]] to the world.
