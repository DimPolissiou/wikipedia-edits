{"title_page": "List of pterosaur genera", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis '''list of pterosaurs''' is a comprehensive listing of all [[Genus|genera]] that have ever been included in the order [[Pterosaur]]ia, excluding purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (''[[nomen dubium]]''), or were not formally published (''[[nomen nudum]]''), as well as [[synonym (zoology)|junior synonyms]] of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered pterosaurian. The list currently includes '''235''' genera.\n\n==Scope and terminology==\nThere is no official, canonical list of pterosaur genera, but the most thorough attempts can be found at the Pterosauria section of Mikko Haaramo's ''Phylogeny Archive'',<ref>{{cite web| last = Haaramo| first = Mikko| title = Pterosauria| work = Mikko's Phylogeny Archive| date = 15 November 2005| url = http://www.fmnh.helsinki.fi/users/haaramo/Metazoa/Deuterostoma/Chordata/Archosauria/Pterosauria/Pterosauria_1.htm| accessdate = 29 March 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070329093343/http://www.fmnh.helsinki.fi/users/haaramo/Metazoa/deuterostoma/Chordata/Archosauria/Pterosauria/pterosauria_1.htm| archivedate = 29 March 2007}}</ref> the Genus Index at Mike Hanson's ''The Pterosauria'',<ref name=\"pterosaur-genus-index\">{{cite web| last = Hanson| first = Mike| title = Genus Index| work = The Pterosauria| publisher = Archosauria.org| date = 12 October 2005| url = http://www.archosauria.org/pterosauria/taxonomy/genera.html| accessdate = 29 March 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701145445/http://www.archosauria.org/pterosauria/taxonomy/genera.html| archivedate = 1 July 2007}}</ref> supplemented by the Pterosaur Species List,<ref>{{cite web| last = Hanson| first = Mike| title = The Pterosaur Species List| work = The Pterosauria| publisher = Archosauria.org| date = 30 September 2006| url = http://archosauria.org/pterosauria/taxonomy/species.pdf| accessdate = 27 July 2007| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070729075625/http://archosauria.org/pterosauria/taxonomy/species.pdf| archivedate = 29 July 2007}}</ref> and in the fourth supplement of [[Donald F.

They are not necessarily the same as the authors of the type species as sometimes a species from one genus is determined sufficiently distinct to warrant the erection of a new genus to house it. If this is the case, only the latter authors will be listed. The '''year''' column notes the year the description was published.\n\n===Status===\nNaming conventions and terminology follow the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. Technical terms used include:\n* '''[[Synonym (zoology)|Junior synonym]]''': A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the [[type (zoology)|type specimens]] are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.\n*'''''[[Nomen nudum]]''''' (Latin for \"naked name\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. ''Nomina nuda'' (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a ''nomen nudum'' and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any ''nomina nuda'' that describe the same specimen.\n*'''Preoccupied name''': A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list.\n*'''''[[Nomen dubium]]''''' (Latin for \"dubious name\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.\n\n===Age===\nThe '''age''' column denotes the [[Series (stratigraphy)|epoch]] of geologic time to which the fossils date. Genera that are invalid, misidentified, or otherwise do not represent a valid pterosaur are listed as age N/A because there was never a time in which a pterosaur by that generic name actually lived.\n\n===Location and notes===\nThe '''location''' column designates the geographic region where remains of the relevant genus have been found. The regions used are continents except in the case of smaller landmasses (e.g. Cuba). Political bodies, being non-existent in the Mesozoic are not used to indicate genera locations. Genera that are invalid, misidentified, or otherwise do not represent a valid pterosaur are listed as location N/A because there was never a place in which a pterosaur by that generic name actually lived. The '''notes''' column is a collection of annotations on the scientific significance and taxonomic history of listed genera, as well as elaborations on the information presented in other columns.\n\n==The list==\n\n===Genera===\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"background:transparent;\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n!width=\"90%\"|\n!width=\"5%\"|\n!width=\"5%\"|\n|-\n|style=\"border:0px\" valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (''[[nomen dubium]]''), or were not formally published (''[[nomen nudum]]''), as well as [[synonym (zoology)|junior synonyms]] of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered pterosaurian.

They are not necessarily the same as the authors of the type species as sometimes a species from one genus is determined sufficiently distinct to warrant the erection of a new genus to house it. If this is the case, only the latter authors will be listed. The '''year''' column notes the year the description was published.\n\n===Status===\nNaming conventions and terminology follow the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. Technical terms used include:\n* '''[[Synonym (zoology)|Junior synonym]]''': A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the [[type (zoology)|type specimens]] are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.\n*'''''[[Nomen nudum]]''''' (Latin for \"naked name\"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. ''Nomina nuda'' (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a ''nomen nudum'' and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any ''nomina nuda'' that describe the same specimen.\n*'''Preoccupied name''': A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list.\n*'''''[[Nomen dubium]]''''' (Latin for \"dubious name\"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.\n\n===Age===\nThe '''age''' column denotes the [[Series (stratigraphy)|epoch]] of geologic time to which the fossils date. Genera that are invalid, misidentified, or otherwise do not represent a valid pterosaur are listed as age N/A because there was never a time in which a pterosaur by that generic name actually lived.\n\n===Location and notes===\nThe '''location''' column designates the geographic region where remains of the relevant genus have been found. The regions used are continents except in the case of smaller landmasses (e.g. Cuba). Political bodies, being non-existent in the Mesozoic are not used to indicate genera locations. Genera that are invalid, misidentified, or otherwise do not represent a valid pterosaur are listed as location N/A because there was never a place in which a pterosaur by that generic name actually lived. The '''notes''' column is a collection of annotations on the scientific significance and taxonomic history of listed genera, as well as elaborations on the information presented in other columns.\n\n==The list==\n\n===Genera===\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"background:transparent;\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n!width=\"90%\"|\n!width=\"5%\"|\n!width=\"5%\"|\n|-\n|style=\"border:0px\" valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

St\u00f8re argued that the G20 undermines the legitimacy of international organizations set up in the aftermath of World War II, such as the IMF, World Bank and United Nations:\n\n{{quote|The G20 is a self-appointed group.

Despite being hit hard by the economic crisis after 2008, Spain is still the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourteenth largest economy]] by [[nominal GDP]] (the 5th in the European Union) and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|sixteenth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]], clearly exceeding the numbers of several current members of the G20 such as Argentina or South Africa. In addition, since the 1990s several Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America, where Spain is the second biggest foreign investor after the United States and keeps an important influence. These facts have reinforced the idea that Spain should seek permanent membership of the G20.\n\n====Polish aspirations====\nIn contrast with the Spanish position, the [[Poland|Polish]] government has repeatedly asked to join the G20.\n\nBefore the [[2009 G20 London summit]], the Polish government expressed an interest in joining with Spain and the Netherlands and condemned an \"organisational mess\" in which a few European leaders speak in the name of all the EU without legitimate authorisation in cases which belong to the [[European Commission]].\n\nDuring a 2010 meeting with foreign diplomats, former Polish president [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] said:\n{{quote|Polish economy is according to our data an 18th world economy.

The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve \"sustained growth\", global energy and resource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes due to an aging world population.\n\nIn 2007, South Africa hosted the secretariat with [[Trevor A.

St\u00f8re argued that the G20 undermines the legitimacy of international organizations set up in the aftermath of World War II, such as the IMF, World Bank and United Nations:\n\n{{quote|The G20 is a self-appointed group. Its composition is determined by the major countries and powers. It may be more representative than the G7 or the G8, in which only the richest countries are represented, but it is still arbitrary. We no longer live in the 19th century, a time when the major powers met and redrew the map of the world.

Despite being hit hard by the economic crisis after 2008, Spain is still the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourteenth largest economy]] by [[nominal GDP]] (the 5th in the European Union) and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|sixteenth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]], clearly exceeding the numbers of several current members of the G20 such as Argentina or South Africa. In addition, since the 1990s several Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America, where Spain is the second biggest foreign investor after the United States and keeps an important influence. These facts have reinforced the idea that Spain should seek permanent membership of the G20.\n\n====Polish aspirations====\nIn contrast with the Spanish position, the [[Poland|Polish]] government has repeatedly asked to join the G20.\n\nBefore the [[2009 G20 London summit]], the Polish government expressed an interest in joining with Spain and the Netherlands and condemned an \"organisational mess\" in which a few European leaders speak in the name of all the EU without legitimate authorisation in cases which belong to the [[European Commission]].\n\nDuring a 2010 meeting with foreign diplomats, former Polish president [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] said:\n{{quote|Polish economy is according to our data an 18th world economy. The place of my country is among the members of the G20. This is a very simple postulate: firstly \u2013 it results from the size of [[Economy of Poland|Polish economy]], secondly \u2013 it results from the fact that Poland is the biggest country in its region and the biggest country that has experienced a certain story.

In 2001 it became '''Ashdown Technology College''' after being awarded specialist status in technology. The school converted to academy status on 1 September 2013 and was renamed Magna Academy.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe construction of Ashdown School began in 1986 in a large field in [[Canford Heath]], [[Poole]], Dorset. The new secondary school would be the result of two closing schools, Seldown Boys School and Ashley Cross Girls School, fusing together. The name Ashdown is a combination of the school's names.\n\nDuring construction, a [[time capsule]] was placed somewhere within the brick walls, the capsule being removed from its previous location in Seldown Boys School. Fifty [[ash tree]]s were planted around the border of the school's field, to represent the school's new name. However, deliberately started fires have destroyed some of the trees, the most recently in 2003. A [[collage]] was made from drawings of the original two schools, that hangs in the entrance of the school.\n\nOn 7 July 1989, the new Ashdown School was opened by [[Princess Margaret]] and headteacher Mollie Snell. Six hundred students attended the opening of the school.\n\n===Events in 1990\u20131999===\nIn 1990, Snell retired from her post as headteacher and passed it on to Ashley Pellegrini, who was previously deputy headteacher of Mellow Lane Comprehensive School in Hayes, Middlesex.

In 2001 it became '''Ashdown Technology College''' after being awarded specialist status in technology. The school converted to academy status on 1 September 2013 and was renamed Magna Academy.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe construction of Ashdown School began in 1986 in a large field in [[Canford Heath]], [[Poole]], Dorset. The new secondary school would be the result of two closing schools, Seldown Boys School and Ashley Cross Girls School, fusing together. The name Ashdown is a combination of the school's names.\n\nDuring construction, a [[time capsule]] was placed somewhere within the brick walls, the capsule being removed from its previous location in Seldown Boys School. Fifty [[ash tree]]s were planted around the border of the school's field, to represent the school's new name. However, deliberately started fires have destroyed some of the trees, the most recently in 2003. A [[collage]] was made from drawings of the original two schools, that hangs in the entrance of the school.\n\nOn 7 July 1989, the new Ashdown School was opened by [[Princess Margaret]] and headteacher Mollie Snell. Six hundred students attended the opening of the school.\n\n===Events in 1990\u20131999===\nIn 1990, Snell retired from her post as headteacher and passed it on to Ashley Pellegrini, who was previously deputy headteacher of Mellow Lane Comprehensive School in Hayes, Middlesex. The school also celebrated its first [[Sports Day]] on the school's field and running track; this became a yearly tradition for the school. New ICT facilities were also opened.\n\nIn 1991, the school performed its first Christmas pantomime, \"The Magic Sword\". School shows eventually disappeared from the yearly events, as did Drama.

It is spread by transfer from the oral/nasal secretions of an infected to the [[oral cavity]] of the uninfected individual. Once in the oral cavity, the virus invades, reproduces in, establishes its lytic phase, and [[lysis]] (i.e. bursts open) [[epithelial]] cells that line the oral [[mucosa]] of the newly infected individual. The freed virus then invades [[na\u00efve B cell]]s located in [[submucosa]]l lymphoid tissue e.g. [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]]. Here, it establishes either a lytic phase that allows it to infect other lymphoid cells or expresses genes that suppress the lytic cycle and impose one of four latency phases. Initially, the virus establishes '''latency III''' by expressing [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latency|''EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, LP, LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''-2B'']] and [[Epstein-Barr virus#Protein/genes|BART]] genes; [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latent antigens|''LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''3A'']] genes; and [[microRNA]]s encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-1'']] and [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-2'']] genes. The products of these genes immortalize, promote the growth and survival, and regulate the maturation of the infected B cell. However, products of some latency III genes (particularly the viral cell surface proteins) make the infected cell susceptible to attack by the host's immune system. The virus avoids this by limiting expression of its latency genes to ''EBNA-1, LMP-1, -2A, -2B'', some BARTs, and the two EBERs. This '''Latency II''' pattern of gene expression continues the infected cells' immortalization and proliferation, helps the cells escape the [[immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]], and forces them to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (i.e. mature) into [[memory B cell]]s. EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency I''' state in its infected memory B cells by expressing only ''EBNA1'' and the two EBER genes. The products of the latter genes keep the virus in a mostly dormant state. Finally, EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency 0''' phase by expressing only EBER genes. In latency 0, EBV is in memory B cells as fully dormant, non-reproductive viruses but in this, as in all of the other latency phases, it can revert to its lytic phase.<ref name=\"pmid30125149\"/> The following table gives more information on the actions of the EBV latency genes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Immunosuppressive drugs associated with the development of these ulcers include [[methotrexate]] (the most often cited drug causing the disease), [[cyclosporin A]], [[azathioprine]], [[mycophenolate]], [[TNF inhibitor]]s, [[tacrolimus]], and [[topical steroid]]s. It is thought that the reduce efficacy of [[Immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]] associated with these predisposing conditions or treatments maintain EBV in a dormant state systemically but not where EBV+ B cells are prevalent, i.e. in afflicted mucous membranes and skin. Consequently, the EBV+ cells at these sites proliferate and destroy tissue to create ulcerating lesions.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\" />\n\nPersons developing these ulcers are usually elderly. Their ulcers are typically isolated, occur in the oral [[mucosa]] and less commonly in skin or [[gastrointestinal tract]] mucosa. Besides pain at the ulcer site and local tissue destruction (which may be severe), individuals with EBV+ mucocutaneous ulcer are symptomless and lack [[lymphadenopathy]] (i.e. enlarged and painful lymph nodes), involvement in other tissues, or B symptoms. However, ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract may present with a variety of abdominal symptoms including acute emergency perforations. Unlike most other forms of EBV+LPD, EBV-associated mucocutantious ulcers are generally not associated with detectable blood levels of EBV.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Microscopically, the ulcers consist of lymphocytes, including EBV+ B cells, sometimes a scattering of other EBV+ lymphoid cell types, and [[histiocyte]]s, [[plasma cells]], [[eosinophils]], and scattered large [[immunoblast]]s which may closely resemble but are not the [[Reed\u2013Sternberg cell]]s seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These Reed-Sternberg\u2013like cells are EBV+ B cells that express the [[tumor marker]] cell surface membrane protein, [[CD30]], the B cell surface membrane marker, [[CD20]],<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> and the proteins typical of the EBV replication cycle latency II or III phase.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nIn elderly individuals with no other cause for immunosuppression, EBV+ mucocutaneous disease may exhibit a relapsing and remitting course with their ulcers worsening but then regressing spontaneously.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Persistent and/or severely symptomatic cases have had excellent responses to [[rituximab]], a commercial [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against the CD20 protein present on B cells.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> Individuals developing these ulcers as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases generally have a remission after the dosages of the drugs used in their immunosuppressive treatment regimens are reduced. Most of these patients do not experience a relapse.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/>\n\n== EBV+ B cell lymphoproliferative diseases ==\nAfter its initial entry into B cells, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus infects other B cells and in doing so may or may not cause a symptomatic disease viz., infectious mononucleosis. In either case, the virus soon switches to its dormant, [[Virus latency|viral latency 0]] phase within [[memory B cell]]s and the infected individual becomes an asymptomatic, lifelong EBV carrier. At any time thereafter, however, the virus may reactivate, enter either its lytic cycle, latency phase II, or latency phase III; spread to other lymphoid cells, and drive its infected cells to proliferate excessively, survive abnormally, and establish an EBV+ LPD.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\n=== Epstein\u2013Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma ===\n{{main|Burkitt's lymphoma}}\n[[Burkitt lymphoma]] occurs in three forms.

The lymphocytes are primarily B cells (e.g., express [[CD20]] and [[CD10]] markers) with rare T cells evident only in the background.<ref name=\"pmid22333947\"/> The B cells are derived mostly from germinal center B cells, contain EBV in latency I phase, and express high levels of EBNA1 and EBER viral products. Some cases also express other EBNA and the LMP2A products.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> EBNA1 and EBER proteins may contribute to the development and/or progression of BL by inhibiting the death by apoptosis of the cells they infect while the product of LMP2A may activate the infected cell's [[PI3K]] [[cell signaling]] pathway thereby stimulating this cell's proliferation.\n\nThe malignant B cells in all three forms of BL commonly have acquired [[chromosomal translocation]]s involving their ''[[MYC]]'' gene. ''MYC'' is a [[Oncogene#Protoo-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] (i.e. a cancer-causing gene if appropriately mutated or overexpressed) located on the long (\"q\") arm of human chromosome 8 at position 24 (i.e. at 8q24). In ~90% of BL cases, ''MYC'' is [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] to the ''[[IGH@|IGH]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain]]) gene locus at position 14q32, the ''[[IGK@|IGK]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin kappa light chain]]) gene at position 2p12 (\"p\" stands for short chromosome arm), or the ''[[IGL@|IGL]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin lambda light chain]]) gene at position 22q11. These translocations  bring ''MYC'' under the [[gene#Transcription|transcriptional]] control of these antibody-forming loci and thereby cause the ''MYC'' product, [[Myc]] to be overexpressed and continuously driving the infected cell to proliferate. Mutations in other genes of the infected cell may promote its malignancy, e.g. ~30% of BL cases harbor B cell ''P53'' gene mutations which may promote cell survival.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These althernate, potentially EBV-independent routes to malignancy and the fact that some BL cases do not involve EBV allow that many cases of EBV+ BL are not caused and/or promoted by EBV: the ubiquitous virus is the likely cause of almost all cases of eBL but be an innocent [[passenger virus]] in many cases of sBL and iBL.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nPatients with any of the three forms of BL (with or without an association with EBV) are treated with  multiple drug [[chemotherapy]] regimens. While past studies found much better results in children than adults using this approach, recent studies report that more aggressive chemotherapy regimens that include the [[intrathecal administration]] of drugs give better results. The COCOX-M-IVAC regimen (systemic [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and high-dose [[methotrexate]] alternating with [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and [[cytarabine]] plus intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine) give event-free 2 year response rates of >90% in both children and adults. Addition of [[rituximab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells, may be added to this or other multiple drug regimens. Autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell bone marrow transplantation]] has not improved the results of these regiments. Treatment of HIV-associated iBL is similar to, and has success rates comparable, to non-HIV BL, particularly when coupled with treatment directed at HIV although adults >40 years old have had poorer responses to these regiments. Cases refractory to these regimens have a poor prognosis with average overall 3 year survival rates of ~7%.<ref name=\"pmid26013028\"/>\n\n=== Epstein\u2013Barr virus-positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis ===\n{{main|Lymphomatoid granulomatosis}}\nEBV+ lymphomatoid granulomatosis (EBV+ LG, also termed [[lymphomatoid granulomatosis]] [LG]) is a rare disease that involves malignant B cells and reactive, non-malignant T cells; it is almost always EBV+.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> This LPD occurs primarily in middle aged males (male:female ratio 2:1).

It is thought to arise in the elderly because of their [[immunosenescence]] as manifested by an age-related decline in the specific types of [[CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity|CD4+]] and [[CD8+ cell|CD8+]] lymphocytes that function to suppress the growth of EBV+ cells.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/> EBV+ DLBCL also occurs in individuals who are overtly immunosuppressed due to [[HIV/AIDS]] (~33% of HIV/AIDS cases are EBV+) or anti-rejection drug therapy following solid organ transplantation (30% to 70% or these cases are EBV+).<ref name=\"pmid28893938\"/> Similarly, the [[Richter transformation]] of EBV+ CLL to EBV+ DLBCL occurs primarily in CLL cases treated with immunosuppressant drugs and therefore appears due in part to immunosuppression-related reactivation of the latent EBV infecting these CLL cells.<ref name=\"pmid27351634\"/> Currant treatments for EBV+ and EBV- DLBCL use either R-CHOP ([[rituximab]], chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, [[cyclophosphamide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[vincristine]], and [[prednisone]] or R-EPOCH [rituximab, [[etoposide]], prednisolone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH).

Reported overall long-term survival and progression-free survival rates in Japan for individuals treated with this regimen are 72% and 61%, respectively. For stage III and IV disease, a more aggressive treatment regimen is used, SMILE (dexamethasone, [[methotrexate]], [[leucovorin]], ifosamide, [[L-asparaginase]], and etoposide followed, in patients with \u22652 [[risk factor]]s, by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation#allogenic|allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation]]); this regimen reportedly achieves complete response and 5 year survival rates of 87% and 73%, respectively. Reported complete response and 5 year survival rates for relapsed or refractory ENKTL treated with the SMILE regimen are 45% and 47%, respectively.<ref name=\"pmid28679966\"/> PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) functions to suppress the proliferation of [[antigen]]-specific T cells and promote the survival of inflammation-suppressing T cells; it is over-expressed in >80% of ENKTL cases. Preparations of the [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against PD-L1 have given encouraging results in small clinical trials on patients with relapsed/refractory ENKTL. For example, [[pembrolizumab]] achieved clinical response in 8 of 15 patients and [[nivolumab]] in 2 of 3 patients with recurrent/refractory ENKTL.

It is spread by transfer from the oral/nasal secretions of an infected to the [[oral cavity]] of the uninfected individual. Once in the oral cavity, the virus invades, reproduces in, establishes its lytic phase, and [[lysis]] (i.e. bursts open) [[epithelial]] cells that line the oral [[mucosa]] of the newly infected individual. The freed virus then invades [[na\u00efve B cell]]s located in [[submucosa]]l lymphoid tissue e.g. [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]]. Here, it establishes either a lytic phase that allows it to infect other lymphoid cells or expresses genes that suppress the lytic cycle and impose one of four latency phases. Initially, the virus establishes '''latency III''' by expressing [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latency|''EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, LP, LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''-2B'']] and [[Epstein-Barr virus#Protein/genes|BART]] genes; [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] proteins encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus#Latent antigens|''LMP-1, -2A,'' and ''3A'']] genes; and [[microRNA]]s encoded by its [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-1'']] and [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNAs#EBER1|''EBER-2'']] genes. The products of these genes immortalize, promote the growth and survival, and regulate the maturation of the infected B cell. However, products of some latency III genes (particularly the viral cell surface proteins) make the infected cell susceptible to attack by the host's immune system. The virus avoids this by limiting expression of its latency genes to ''EBNA-1, LMP-1, -2A, -2B'', some BARTs, and the two EBERs. This '''Latency II''' pattern of gene expression continues the infected cells' immortalization and proliferation, helps the cells escape the [[immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]], and forces them to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (i.e. mature) into [[memory B cell]]s. EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency I''' state in its infected memory B cells by expressing only ''EBNA1'' and the two EBER genes. The products of the latter genes keep the virus in a mostly dormant state. Finally, EBV may establish and maintain a '''Latency 0''' phase by expressing only EBER genes. In latency 0, EBV is in memory B cells as fully dormant, non-reproductive viruses but in this, as in all of the other latency phases, it can revert to its lytic phase.<ref name=\"pmid30125149\"/> The following table gives more information on the actions of the EBV latency genes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The disorder may take a protracted course without progression over several years or a fulminant course with life-threatening complications such as [[Hemophagocytosis]] (i.e. ingestion of blodd cells by [[histiocyte]]s), [[myocarditis]], liver failure, [[interstitial pneumonia]], or [[Gastrointestinal perforation|rupture of the intestines]].<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> CAEBV can progress to a malignant type of EBV+ T-cell LPD such as aggressive NK cell leukemia, NK/T cell leukemia, or peripheral T cell lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid29375552\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimura H, Cohen JI | title = Chronic Active Epstein-Barr Virus Disease | journal = Frontiers in Immunology | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 1867 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29375552 | pmc = 5770746 | doi = 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01867 | url = }}</ref>\n\nThe disorder may involve EBV+ T, NK, or, rarely, B cells. In EBV+ T and NK cell-associated disease, the tissues affected by CAEBV usually exhibit an histology that is not suggestive of a malignancy: lymph nodes have areas of [[hyperplasia]], focal [[necrosis]], and small [[granuloma]]s; spleen shows [[atrophy]] of [[white pulp]] with congested [[red pulp]]; liver contains infiltrations of small lymphocytes around portal vasculature and sinuses; and lung and heart have findings typical of [[Interstitial lung disease|interstitial pneumonitis]] and viral [[myocarditis]], respectively. Erythrophagocytosis (i.e. ingestion of [[red blood cells]] by histiocytes) often occurs in the bone marrow, spleen, and/or liver. The principal EBV+ cells in these tissues are T cells in ~59%, both T- and NK cells in ~40%,<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> and B cells in ~2% of cases.

The lesions occur primarily on the sun-exposed skin of the face and back of the hand. It is an EBV+ disorder in which most cases develop in children, follow a waxing and waning course, and resolve in early adulthood. However, the disorder can occur in adults. Furthermore, the disease in children or adults may progress to cause severe, extensive, and disfiguring skin lesions unrelated to sunlight exposure, facial edema, and systemic manifestations such as fever, weight loss, and enlargements of lymph nodes, liver, and/or spleen. These cases may progress to an EBV+ LPD such as [[T cell lymphoma]], [[T cell leukemia]], [[B cell lymphoma]], or [[B cell leukemia]].<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> The milder and more aggressive forms of hydroa vacciniforme were initially termed classic hydroa vacciniforme and hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma, respectively, but extensive overlap between the two disease types lead the 2016 [[World Health Organization]] to reclassify them into a single disorder termed Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoproliferative disease and to be a subcategory of CAEBV.

It is thought that the reduce efficacy of [[Immune system#Tumor immunology|immune surveillance]] associated with these predisposing conditions or treatments maintain EBV in a dormant state systemically but not where EBV+ B cells are prevalent, i.e. in afflicted mucous membranes and skin. Consequently, the EBV+ cells at these sites proliferate and destroy tissue to create ulcerating lesions.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\" />\n\nPersons developing these ulcers are usually elderly. Their ulcers are typically isolated, occur in the oral [[mucosa]] and less commonly in skin or [[gastrointestinal tract]] mucosa. Besides pain at the ulcer site and local tissue destruction (which may be severe), individuals with EBV+ mucocutaneous ulcer are symptomless and lack [[lymphadenopathy]] (i.e. enlarged and painful lymph nodes), involvement in other tissues, or B symptoms. However, ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract may present with a variety of abdominal symptoms including acute emergency perforations. Unlike most other forms of EBV+LPD, EBV-associated mucocutantious ulcers are generally not associated with detectable blood levels of EBV.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Microscopically, the ulcers consist of lymphocytes, including EBV+ B cells, sometimes a scattering of other EBV+ lymphoid cell types, and [[histiocyte]]s, [[plasma cells]], [[eosinophils]], and scattered large [[immunoblast]]s which may closely resemble but are not the [[Reed\u2013Sternberg cell]]s seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These Reed-Sternberg\u2013like cells are EBV+ B cells that express the [[tumor marker]] cell surface membrane protein, [[CD30]], the B cell surface membrane marker, [[CD20]],<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> and the proteins typical of the EBV replication cycle latency II or III phase.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nIn elderly individuals with no other cause for immunosuppression, EBV+ mucocutaneous disease may exhibit a relapsing and remitting course with their ulcers worsening but then regressing spontaneously.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/> Persistent and/or severely symptomatic cases have had excellent responses to [[rituximab]], a commercial [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against the CD20 protein present on B cells.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> Individuals developing these ulcers as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases generally have a remission after the dosages of the drugs used in their immunosuppressive treatment regimens are reduced. Most of these patients do not experience a relapse.<ref name=\"pmid28477890\"/>\n\n== EBV+ B cell lymphoproliferative diseases ==\nAfter its initial entry into B cells, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus infects other B cells and in doing so may or may not cause a symptomatic disease viz., infectious mononucleosis. In either case, the virus soon switches to its dormant, [[Virus latency|viral latency 0]] phase within [[memory B cell]]s and the infected individual becomes an asymptomatic, lifelong EBV carrier. At any time thereafter, however, the virus may reactivate, enter either its lytic cycle, latency phase II, or latency phase III; spread to other lymphoid cells, and drive its infected cells to proliferate excessively, survive abnormally, and establish an EBV+ LPD.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\n=== Epstein\u2013Barr virus-positive Burkitt lymphoma ===\n{{main|Burkitt's lymphoma}}\n[[Burkitt lymphoma]] occurs in three forms.

The lymphocytes are primarily B cells (e.g., express [[CD20]] and [[CD10]] markers) with rare T cells evident only in the background.<ref name=\"pmid22333947\"/> The B cells are derived mostly from germinal center B cells, contain EBV in latency I phase, and express high levels of EBNA1 and EBER viral products.

''MYC'' is a [[Oncogene#Protoo-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] (i.e. a cancer-causing gene if appropriately mutated or overexpressed) located on the long (\"q\") arm of human chromosome 8 at position 24 (i.e. at 8q24). In ~90% of BL cases, ''MYC'' is [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] to the ''[[IGH@|IGH]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain]]) gene locus at position 14q32, the ''[[IGK@|IGK]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin kappa light chain]]) gene at position 2p12 (\"p\" stands for short chromosome arm), or the ''[[IGL@|IGL]]'' (i.e. [[Immunoglobulin light chain|immunoglobulin lambda light chain]]) gene at position 22q11. These translocations  bring ''MYC'' under the [[gene#Transcription|transcriptional]] control of these antibody-forming loci and thereby cause the ''MYC'' product, [[Myc]] to be overexpressed and continuously driving the infected cell to proliferate. Mutations in other genes of the infected cell may promote its malignancy, e.g. ~30% of BL cases harbor B cell ''P53'' gene mutations which may promote cell survival.<ref name=\"pmid29518976\"/> These althernate, potentially EBV-independent routes to malignancy and the fact that some BL cases do not involve EBV allow that many cases of EBV+ BL are not caused and/or promoted by EBV: the ubiquitous virus is the likely cause of almost all cases of eBL but be an innocent [[passenger virus]] in many cases of sBL and iBL.<ref name=\"pmid29885408\"/>\n\nPatients with any of the three forms of BL (with or without an association with EBV) are treated with  multiple drug [[chemotherapy]] regimens. While past studies found much better results in children than adults using this approach, recent studies report that more aggressive chemotherapy regimens that include the [[intrathecal administration]] of drugs give better results. The COCOX-M-IVAC regimen (systemic [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], and high-dose [[methotrexate]] alternating with [[ifosfamide]], [[etoposide]], and [[cytarabine]] plus intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine) give event-free 2 year response rates of >90% in both children and adults. Addition of [[rituximab]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] against the CD20 antigen expressed on B cells, may be added to this or other multiple drug regimens. Autologous [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|stem cell bone marrow transplantation]] has not improved the results of these regiments. Treatment of HIV-associated iBL is similar to, and has success rates comparable, to non-HIV BL, particularly when coupled with treatment directed at HIV although adults >40 years old have had poorer responses to these regiments.

This league ceased operations in 1898, but was revived again for the following season.<ref name=SABR/>  It was renamed the Central League in 1900.  In 1901, two leagues were called the Western Association.  One had eight teams in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Indiana]]; it folded after only one year. The other loop, confusingly located in the same geographic area, was the former [[Interstate League]]; it reverted to its original identity in 1902.<ref name=SABR/>\n\nThe most long-lived Western Association played between 1905 and 1954.<ref name=SABR/> Originally the [[Missouri Valley League]], it existed for 42 years during that half century, suspending operations during both world wars and for one season (1933) during the [[Great Depression]].

Epub 2019 Jan 24 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034819300380?via%3Dihub]</ref>\n\n====Highly Active MS====\n\nAs of 2019, HAMS is defined as an RRMS phenotype with one or more of the following characteristics:<ref name=\"Diaz2019\"/>\n\n# DSS scale of 4 points at 5 years of onset of the disease\n# Multiple relapses (two or more) with incomplete recovery in the ongoing year\n# More than 2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrating new lesions or increase in the size of the lesions in T2, or lesions that enhance with gadolinium despite treatment (Clinical case 1 and 2).\n# No response to treatment with one or more DMTs for at least one year.\n\nThere is a group of patients who have defined clinical and radiological risk factors that predict a behavior of greater risk of conversion to HAMS, without having the diagnostic criteria of HAMS in a first clinical attack have predictors of high risk.\n\nSome other previous authors have used other definitions like:\n\n*High activity according to 2017 definition of activity\n*Rapid accumulation of physical and cognitive deficit, despite treatment with DMT's.\n*Being eligible for immunoablative therapy followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) because of a) the failure of conventional treatment, b) frequent and severe (disabling) relapses, or c) MRI activity (new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesions).\n\n====Malignant MS====\n\nOccasionally, the term \u2018malignant\u2019 MS (MMS) has been used to describe aggressive phenotypes of MS, but this is another ambiguous term that\u2014despite wide usage\u2014means different things to different people.\n\nIn 1996, the US National MS Society (NMSS) Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis, \u201cmalignant MS\u201d was also included, namely, \u201cdisease with a rapid progressive course, leading to significant disability in multiple neurologic systems or death in a relatively short time after disease onset.\u201d\n\nMany authors reserve the term malignant for fulminant forms of MS that deteriorate so rapidly from the outset as to be almost monophasic, and result in death within months to a few years. One such example is the Marburg variant of MS, which is classically characterized by extensive necrotic and/or tumefactive lesions with mass effect.\n\nInterestingly, despite recent (and increasing) emphasis on early detection of patients with aggressive MS, the original definition of MMS was not modified by the NMSS Advisory Committee in its latest publication in 2013 (Lublin et al., 2014).\n\n====Aggressive MS====\n\nCommon to all definitions is the early, unexpected acquisition of disability followed by frequent relapses and highly active disease seen on MRI.\n\nOne definition can be based on EDSS score and the time to develop secondary progressive MS (SPMS) (Menon et al., 2013).\n\nNo consensus exists on the speed of progression or degree of disability sufficient for aggressive MS, but we can assume that reaching an EDSS score of 6 points probably represents an upper limit beyond which the risk-benefit ratio for an aggressive treatment is unfavourable.\n\nPragmatically, AMS has been defined as any type of MS that is associated with repeated severe attacks and accelerated accrual of disability\u2014put more simply, \u2018rapidly progressive\u2019 MS (See below)\n\n==== Rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis ====\n\nThis kind of MS was previously reported to behave different that the standard progressive course,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1191/1352458503ms931oa| pmid=12926837| title=A role for hypertrophic astrocytes and astrocyte precursors in a case of rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis| journal=Multiple Sclerosis Journal| volume=9| issue=4| pages=332\u2013341| year=2003| last1=Morcos| first1=Yvette| last2=Lee| first2=Sang Min| last3=Levin| first3=Michael C.}}</ref> being linked to [[Connexin 43]] autoantibodies with [[Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|pattern III]] lesions (distal oligodendrogliopathy)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Masaki K, Suzuki SO, Matsushita T, Matsuoka T, Imamura S, Yamasaki R, etal | year = 2013 | title = Connexin 43 Astrocytopathy Linked to Rapidly Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica | journal =PLOS One| volume = 8 | issue = 8| page = e72919 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0072919 | pmid=23991165 | pmc=3749992| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...872919M }}</ref> and being responsive to [[plasma exchange]]<ref>Seidi, Osheik, The Role of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Clinical Neurology, university of Khartoum, http://khartoumspace.uofk.edu/handle/123456789/19625</ref>\n\nIn very rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis the use of immunosuppressive therapy (mitoxantrone/cyclophosphamide), rituximab, autologous haematopoietic stem cell therapy or combination therapy should be considered carefully.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Broadley SA, etal | year = 2015 | title = A new era in the treatment of multiple sclerosis | url = | journal =Medical Journal of Australia| volume = 203 | issue = 3| pages = 139\u2013141 | doi = 10.5694/mja14.01218 | pmid = 26224184 | hdl = 10536/DRO/DU:30080418 }}</ref>\n\n==Under research==\n\nSome auto-antibodies have been found consistently across different MS cases but there is still no agreement on their relevance:\n\n*'''Anti-kir4.1''': A [[KCNJ10|KIR4.1]] multiple sclerosis variant was reported in 2012<ref name=\"pmid22784115\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Srivastava R, Aslam M, Kalluri SR, Schirmer L, Buck D, Tackenberg B, Rothhammer V, Chan A, Gold R, Berthele A, Bennett JL, Korn T, Hemmer B | title = Potassium channel KIR4.1 as an immune target in multiple sclerosis | journal =New England Journal of Medicine| volume = 367 | issue = 2 | pages = 115\u201323 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22784115 | pmc = 5131800 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1110740 }}</ref> and later reported again,<ref name=\"pmid24032025\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider R | title = Autoantibodies to Potassium Channel KIR4.1 in Multiple Sclerosis | journal =Frontiers in Neurology| volume = 4 | issue = | page = 125 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24032025 | pmc = 3759297 | doi = 10.3389/fneur.2013.00125 }}</ref> which could be considered a different disease (as [[Devic's disease]] did before), and can represent up to a 47% of the MS cases\n*'''Anoctamin 2''': Auto-antibodies against anoctamin-2 (ANO-2), one of the ion-channel proteins, have been reported consistently since 2013<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1074/mcp.M112.026757|pmid = 23732997|pmc = 3769337|title = Autoantibody Profiling in Multiple Sclerosis Using Arrays of Human Protein Fragments|journal =Molecular & Cellular Proteomics|volume = 12|issue = 9|pages = 2657\u20132672|year = 2013|last1 = Ayoglu|first1 = Burcu|last2 = H\u00e4ggmark|first2 = Anna|last3 = Khademi|first3 = Mohsen|last4 = Olsson|first4 = Tomas|last5 = Uhl\u00e9n|first5 = Mathias|last6 = Schwenk|first6 = Jochen M.|last7 = Nilsson|first7 = Peter}}</ref>\n**This finding is not universal.

One such example is the Marburg variant of MS, which is classically characterized by extensive necrotic and/or tumefactive lesions with mass effect.\n\nInterestingly, despite recent (and increasing) emphasis on early detection of patients with aggressive MS, the original definition of MMS was not modified by the NMSS Advisory Committee in its latest publication in 2013 (Lublin et al., 2014).\n\n====Aggressive MS====\n\nCommon to all definitions is the early, unexpected acquisition of disability followed by frequent relapses and highly active disease seen on MRI.\n\nOne definition can be based on EDSS score and the time to develop secondary progressive MS (SPMS) (Menon et al., 2013).\n\nNo consensus exists on the speed of progression or degree of disability sufficient for aggressive MS, but we can assume that reaching an EDSS score of 6 points probably represents an upper limit beyond which the risk-benefit ratio for an aggressive treatment is unfavourable.\n\nPragmatically, AMS has been defined as any type of MS that is associated with repeated severe attacks and accelerated accrual of disability\u2014put more simply, \u2018rapidly progressive\u2019 MS (See below)\n\n==== Rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis ====\n\nThis kind of MS was previously reported to behave different that the standard progressive course,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1191/1352458503ms931oa| pmid=12926837| title=A role for hypertrophic astrocytes and astrocyte precursors in a case of rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis| journal=Multiple Sclerosis Journal| volume=9| issue=4| pages=332\u2013341| year=2003| last1=Morcos| first1=Yvette| last2=Lee| first2=Sang Min| last3=Levin| first3=Michael C.}}</ref> being linked to [[Connexin 43]] autoantibodies with [[Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|pattern III]] lesions (distal oligodendrogliopathy)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Masaki K, Suzuki SO, Matsushita T, Matsuoka T, Imamura S, Yamasaki R, etal | year = 2013 | title = Connexin 43 Astrocytopathy Linked to Rapidly Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and Neuromyelitis Optica | journal =PLOS One| volume = 8 | issue = 8| page = e72919 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0072919 | pmid=23991165 | pmc=3749992| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...872919M }}</ref> and being responsive to [[plasma exchange]]<ref>Seidi, Osheik, The Role of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Clinical Neurology, university of Khartoum, http://khartoumspace.uofk.edu/handle/123456789/19625</ref>\n\nIn very rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis the use of immunosuppressive therapy (mitoxantrone/cyclophosphamide), rituximab, autologous haematopoietic stem cell therapy or combination therapy should be considered carefully.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Broadley SA, etal | year = 2015 | title = A new era in the treatment of multiple sclerosis | url = | journal =Medical Journal of Australia| volume = 203 | issue = 3| pages = 139\u2013141 | doi = 10.5694/mja14.01218 | pmid = 26224184 | hdl = 10536/DRO/DU:30080418 }}</ref>\n\n==Under research==\n\nSome auto-antibodies have been found consistently across different MS cases but there is still no agreement on their relevance:\n\n*'''Anti-kir4.1''': A [[KCNJ10|KIR4.1]] multiple sclerosis variant was reported in 2012<ref name=\"pmid22784115\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Srivastava R, Aslam M, Kalluri SR, Schirmer L, Buck D, Tackenberg B, Rothhammer V, Chan A, Gold R, Berthele A, Bennett JL, Korn T, Hemmer B | title = Potassium channel KIR4.1 as an immune target in multiple sclerosis | journal =New England Journal of Medicine| volume = 367 | issue = 2 | pages = 115\u201323 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22784115 | pmc = 5131800 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1110740 }}</ref> and later reported again,<ref name=\"pmid24032025\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider R | title = Autoantibodies to Potassium Channel KIR4.1 in Multiple Sclerosis | journal =Frontiers in Neurology| volume = 4 | issue = | page = 125 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24032025 | pmc = 3759297 | doi = 10.3389/fneur.2013.00125 }}</ref> which could be considered a different disease (as [[Devic's disease]] did before), and can represent up to a 47% of the MS cases\n*'''Anoctamin 2''': Auto-antibodies against anoctamin-2 (ANO-2), one of the ion-channel proteins, have been reported consistently since 2013<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1074/mcp.M112.026757|pmid = 23732997|pmc = 3769337|title = Autoantibody Profiling in Multiple Sclerosis Using Arrays of Human Protein Fragments|journal =Molecular & Cellular Proteomics|volume = 12|issue = 9|pages = 2657\u20132672|year = 2013|last1 = Ayoglu|first1 = Burcu|last2 = H\u00e4ggmark|first2 = Anna|last3 = Khademi|first3 = Mohsen|last4 = Olsson|first4 = Tomas|last5 = Uhl\u00e9n|first5 = Mathias|last6 = Schwenk|first6 = Jochen M.|last7 = Nilsson|first7 = Peter}}</ref>\n**This finding is not universal.

Whether they constitute a separate disease is still an open subject. Anyway, even this pubertal MS could be more than one disease, because early-onset and late-onset have different demyelination patterns<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chabas D, Castillo-Trivino T, Mowry EM, Strober JB, Glenn OA, Waubant E | title = Vanishing MS T2-bright lesions before puberty: a distinct MRI phenotype? | journal =Neurology| volume = 71 | issue = 14 | pages = 1090\u20133  | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18824673 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000326896.66714.ae | citeseerx = 10.1.1.594.9445 }}</ref>\n\nPediatric MS patients tend to have active inflammatory disease course with a tendency to have brainstem / cerebellar presentations at onset.

The most commonly used definition, the [[McDonald criteria]], requires just the presence of demyelinating lesions separated in space and time, together with the exclusion of every known demyelinating condition.\n\nThis unspecific definition has been critizised. For some people this has turned MS into an [[heterogeneous condition]] with several underlying problems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4199/C00116ED1V01Y201408ISP055 |title=Multiple Sclerosis: An Overview of Clinical Features, Pathophysiology, Neuroimaging, and Treatment Options |journal=Colloquium Series on Integrated Systems Physiology: From Molecule to Function|volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=1\u2013117 |year=2014 |last1=Minagar |first1=Alireza |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/92e89d91404b21c6be25796e086b889fa7828f56 }}</ref> Besides, the complementary problem also exists. Given that McDonalds-MS is based just in the distribution of the lesions, even twins with the same underlying condition can be classified different<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1097/01.NT.0000508402.13786.97|title = News from the ECTRIMS Congress|journal =Neurology Today|volume = 16|issue = 21|pages = 18\u201319|year = 2016|last1 = Susman|first1 = Ed}}</ref>\n\nFinally, the \"exclusion of every other known disease\" condition also creates problems. Rightfully classified MS patients can be rightfully classified out of the spectrum when their particular underlying problem is discovered. For example, [[neuromyelitis optica]] was previously considered MS and currently is not, even if it appears that the MS definition has not changed.\n\nCurrently there is no single diagnosis test for MS that is 100% [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive and specific]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nrneurol.2015.106|pmid = 26149978|title = MAGNIMS consensus guidelines on the use of MRI in multiple sclerosis\u2014clinical implementation in the diagnostic process|journal =Nature Reviews Neurology|volume = 11|issue = 8|pages = 471\u2013482|year = 2015|last1 = Rovira|first1 = \u00c0lex|last2 = Wattjes|first2 = Mike P.|last3 = Tintor\u00e9|first3 = Mar|last4 = Tur|first4 = Carmen|last5 = Yousry|first5 = Tarek A.|last6 = Sormani|first6 = Maria P.|last7 = De Stefano|first7 = Nicola|last8 = Filippi|first8 = Massimo|last9 = Auger|first9 = Cristina|last10 = Rocca|first10 = Maria A.|last11 = Barkhof|first11 = Frederik|last12 = Fazekas|first12 = Franz|last13 = Kappos|first13 = Ludwig|last14 = Polman|first14 = Chris|last15 = Miller|first15 = David|last16 = Montalban|first16 = Xavier}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23529352\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mistry N, Dixon J, Tallantyre E, Tench C, Abdel-Fahim R, Jaspan T, Morgan PS, Morris P, Evangelou N | title = Central veins in brain lesions visualized with high-field magnetic resonance imaging: a pathologically specific diagnostic biomarker for inflammatory demyelination in the brain | journal =JAMA Neurology| volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 623\u20138 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23529352 | doi = 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.1405}}</ref>\n\n===Pathological and clinical definitions===\n\n[[McDonald criteria]] propose a clinical diagnosis based on a pathological definition, saying that the focus for diagnosis \"remains on the objective demonstration of dissemination of lesions in both time and space\" (DIT and DIS).
