In the cartel, Ramos Rangel is known by her aliases '''Big Momma''' and '''La T\u00eda''' (The Aunt). She has reportedly been responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking shipments from Mexico to the United States since the mid-1980s. Her role in organized crime is unique, as a woman active in the male-dominated Mexican drug trafficking industry over several decades. \n\nRamos Rangel is wanted in the U.S. states of [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] for her alleged involvement in drug trafficking. According to multiple federal indictments, Ramos Rangel has employed family members to distribute cocaine in the United States on her behalf. She has also employed inmates from U.S. federal facilities to help her distribute drugs after their release from prison.

The agents were investigating a Mexican drug trafficking ring smuggling marijuana through Mexico, South Texas, Houston, and other parts of the United States. Ramos Rangel was discovered living at the house. US$15,000 in cash was found in a trash can, with a list of apparent drug transactions. When questioned, Ramos Rangel refused to cooperate. She was arrested, not on drug charges but because she was in the country illegally. She had already served a prison sentence in the United States for a previous drug offense, and had been deported and ordered never to return to the country. Ramos Rangel was a low-level criminal during that time. In subsequent years, she rose through the leadership ranks of the Gulf Cartel.<ref name=\"DoYEB\" /> \n\nUnited States officials have issued extradition requests to the Mexican government since her ascent, but acknowledge the legal difficulties of the process.<ref name=\":7\" /> The FBI-led case against Ramos Rangel began in 2010.<ref name=\"1177Z\" /> With the joint participation of the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), the FBI's case has yielded arrests in Arkansas, Brownsville and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=\"Hf2pY\" /> The operation was code-named Operation Dirty Bird.<ref name=\"EcSaF\" />\n\n==Indictments and network==\nIn April 2011, the [[Cameron County Sheriff's Office]] in Brownsville seized {{Convert|30|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of cocaine heading to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. According to several witnesses who testified to law enforcement, the cocaine shipment was owned by Ramos Rangel. A Brownsville drug trafficker, Julio Cesar Cardenas, was involved in the scheme, helping a co-conspirator to move Ramos Rangel's drug load. Cardenas assisted by storing {{Convert|3|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of the cocaine. After police seized the drugs, Cardenas advised the co-conspirator on how to deal with Ramos Rangel, recommending the use of violence, specifically kidnappings and bombs, to settle disputes with her gangsters.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nOn 2 May 2013, Ramos Rangel was indicted by a federal grand jury in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas]] for several drug trafficking offenses, including possession of narcotics with intent to distribute them; cocaine trafficking; and using a telephone to coordinate drug trafficking activities. A federal warrant for her arrest was issued that day in Arkansas. The indictment was unsealed in court on 14 May.<ref name=\":5\" /> Under a [[Indictment#Types|superseding indictment]] charging other criminals associated with her, another federal arrest warrant was issued for Ramos Rangel in Arkansas on 6 June 2013 following the arrest of several of her alleged associates.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indictments stated that, on or around June 2008, Ramos Rangel and 15 of her associates (updated to 17 by a superseding indictment on 2 April 2014) knowingly possessed, with intent to distribute, at least {{Convert|5|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of cocaine.{{sfn|McCormack|2013|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|McCormack|2014|pp=1\u20132}} Ramos Rangel's network was accused of distributing over {{Convert|100|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of cocaine in Arkansas. Ramos Rangel was identified as the lead conspirator.<ref name=\":0\" /> She employed her children and other relatives to work under her.<ref name=\"NvURc\" /> \n\nRamos Rangel reportedly coordinated with her son, Mohammed Kazam Martinez (\"Mo\"), who was imprisoned at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Forrest City, Arkansas]], to recruit inmates to assist in distributing cocaine for her network upon their release from prison.{{efn|When Ramos Rangel's network used this hiring method it was a relatively new tactic for Mexican drug cartels. Inmates close to finishing their sentences are employed in order to work for the cartel on their release. These inmates are not directly part of the cartel's hierarchy, and are generally regarded as \"work-for-hire\" members.<ref name=\"ijFEQ\" />}}<ref name=\":4\" /> Among those inmates were Emmanuel Ilo (\"Chi\") and Mervin Johnson (\"Slim\"), who distributed cocaine for her in central Arkansas after they were released.<ref name=\"MvuLi\" /> Ramos Rangel's son used the prison's telephone system and emails to communicate with other members of her network.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\"dMUHF\" /> In one recorded telephone conversation with Johnson, quoted in Ramos Rangel's indictment, Martinez mentions his mother's role in the conspiracy while discussing a drug debt, saying: \"You owe Big Momma some money.

Through Ilo, her network worked with local dealers, including Dwatney Noid, Dwight McLittle (\"D.A.\"), Lamont Williams (\"Peter Rabbit\"), Gerard Trice (\"Fly\"), Tarvars Honorable (\"Pudgy\"), and Shanieka Tatum, who distributed directly to buyers. All of Ramos Rangel's associates deliberately concealed the nature of their activities, and used coded language and [[countersurveillance]] to avoid law enforcement detection.{{sfn|McCormack|2013|p=4}} \n\nAuthorities described the case against Ramos Rangel as atypical, as it involved an international criminal group, coordination among federal inmates, and the supply of a large quantity of cocaine to Arkansas. The value of the cocaine trafficked to Arkansas by Ramos Rangel's network is estimated at US$10&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"CwxYZ\" /> If Ramos Rangel is found guilty of the conspiracy charge, she faces a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence, up to life imprisonment, with up to US$10&nbsp;million in fines, and five years of mandatory supervised release. If found guilty of possession with intent to distribute less than {{Convert|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} of cocaine, the maximum sentence would be 20 years, a US$1&nbsp;million fine, and three years of supervised release. The charge of using a communication device to facilitate drug trafficking activities carries a maximum four-year sentence, US$250,000 in fines, and up to a year of supervised release.<ref name=\":5\"

According to the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), she is a high-ranking member of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico. In the cartel, Ramos Rangel is known by her aliases '''Big Momma''' and '''La T\u00eda''' (The Aunt). She has reportedly been responsible for coordinating international drug trafficking shipments from Mexico to the United States since the mid-1980s. Her role in organized crime is unique, as a woman active in the male-dominated Mexican drug trafficking industry over several decades. \n\nRamos Rangel is wanted in the U.S. states of [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] for her alleged involvement in drug trafficking. According to multiple federal indictments, Ramos Rangel has employed family members to distribute cocaine in the United States on her behalf. She has also employed inmates from U.S. federal facilities to help her distribute drugs after their release from prison. Investigators believe she is hiding in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], her hometown and center of operations. The FBI is offering a US$25,000 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] to anyone providing information that leads to her arrest and conviction.\n\n==Early life and career==\nIdalia Ramos Rangel was born in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, on 20 May 1955.

Her current whereabouts are unknown, and the FBI is offering a $25,000 bounty for information leading to her arrest and conviction.<ref name=\":0\" /> She faces federal drug charges in the states of [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]], and has been a fugitive of United States justice since the 1980s.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"Yp8kB\" />\n\nIn the late 1990s, U.S. authorities searched a home in [[Brownsville, Texas]] during an anti-marijuana operation. The agents were investigating a Mexican drug trafficking ring smuggling marijuana through Mexico, South Texas, Houston, and other parts of the United States. Ramos Rangel was discovered living at the house. US$15,000 in cash was found in a trash can, with a list of apparent drug transactions. When questioned, Ramos Rangel refused to cooperate. She was arrested, not on drug charges but because she was in the country illegally. She had already served a prison sentence in the United States for a previous drug offense, and had been deported and ordered never to return to the country. Ramos Rangel was a low-level criminal during that time. In subsequent years, she rose through the leadership ranks of the Gulf Cartel.<ref name=\"DoYEB\" /> \n\nUnited States officials have issued extradition requests to the Mexican government since her ascent, but acknowledge the legal difficulties of the process.<ref name=\":7\" /> The FBI-led case against Ramos Rangel began in 2010.<ref name=\"1177Z\" /> With the joint participation of the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), the FBI's case has yielded arrests in Arkansas, Brownsville and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=\"Hf2pY\" /> The operation was code-named Operation Dirty Bird.<ref name=\"EcSaF\" />\n\n==Indictments and network==\nIn April 2011, the [[Cameron County Sheriff's Office]] in Brownsville seized {{Convert|30|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of cocaine heading to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. According to several witnesses who testified to law enforcement, the cocaine shipment was owned by Ramos Rangel. A Brownsville drug trafficker, Julio Cesar Cardenas, was involved in the scheme, helping a co-conspirator to move Ramos Rangel's drug load. Cardenas assisted by storing {{Convert|3|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of the cocaine. After police seized the drugs, Cardenas advised the co-conspirator on how to deal with Ramos Rangel, recommending the use of violence, specifically kidnappings and bombs, to settle disputes with her gangsters.<ref name=\":8\" /> \n\nOn 2 May 2013, Ramos Rangel was indicted by a federal grand jury in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas]] for several drug trafficking offenses, including possession of narcotics with intent to distribute them; cocaine trafficking; and using a telephone to coordinate drug trafficking activities. A federal warrant for her arrest was issued that day in Arkansas. The indictment was unsealed in court on 14 May.<ref name=\":5\" /> Under a [[Indictment#Types|superseding indictment]] charging other criminals associated with her, another federal arrest warrant was issued for Ramos Rangel in Arkansas on 6 June 2013 following the arrest of several of her alleged associates.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indictments stated that, on or around June 2008, Ramos Rangel and 15 of her associates (updated to 17 by a superseding indictment on 2 April 2014) knowingly possessed, with intent to distribute, at least {{Convert|5|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of cocaine.{{sfn|McCormack|2013|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|McCormack|2014|pp=1\u20132}} Ramos Rangel's network was accused of distributing over {{Convert|100|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} of cocaine in Arkansas. Ramos Rangel was identified as the lead conspirator.<ref name=\":0\" /> She employed her children and other relatives to work under her.<ref name=\"NvURc\" /> \n\nRamos Rangel reportedly coordinated with her son, Mohammed Kazam Martinez (\"Mo\"), who was imprisoned at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Forrest City, Arkansas]], to recruit inmates to assist in distributing cocaine for her network upon their release from prison.{{efn|When Ramos Rangel's network used this hiring method it was a relatively new tactic for Mexican drug cartels. Inmates close to finishing their sentences are employed in order to work for the cartel on their release. These inmates are not directly part of the cartel's hierarchy, and are generally regarded as \"work-for-hire\" members.<ref name=\"ijFEQ\" />}}<ref name=\":4\" /> Among those inmates were Emmanuel Ilo (\"Chi\") and Mervin Johnson (\"Slim\"), who distributed cocaine for her in central Arkansas after they were released.<ref name=\"MvuLi\" /> Ramos Rangel's son used the prison's telephone system and emails to communicate with other members of her network.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\"dMUHF\" /> In one recorded telephone conversation with Johnson, quoted in Ramos Rangel's indictment, Martinez mentions his mother's role in the conspiracy while discussing a drug debt, saying: \"You owe Big Momma some money. If you keep f***ing up,<!--Note: the asterisks are in the original source. --> they gonna cut everybody off. You are gonna f**k<!--Note: the asterisks are in the original source. --> [Ilo] and me up because of you.\"{{sfn|McCormack|2013|p=3}}\n\nOther members of Ramos Rangel's network included her son Homar Martinez, Manuel Garza (\"Manny\"), Jaime Benavides, her daughter Nishme Martinez (\"La Gorda\"), Denice Duran Martinez, Yadira Anahy Martinez, Leobarda Jaime Ugalde (\"Leo\") and Juan Alonso Morales.{{sfn|McCormack|2013|pp=3\u20134}}{{sfn|McCormack|2014|p=3}} They helped Ramos Rangel by securing cocaine deliveries from Mexico and Texas to Little Rock, collecting cash proceeds, creating bank accounts and depositing/withdrawing money, liaising with other drug dealers in Mexico and the United States, and smuggling cash earnings back into Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" />{{sfn|McCormack|2013|pp=3\u20134}} Ramos Rangel used local redistributors, who sold the cocaine in Arkansas. Through Ilo, her network worked with local dealers, including Dwatney Noid, Dwight McLittle (\"D.A.\"), Lamont Williams (\"Peter Rabbit\"), Gerard Trice (\"Fly\"), Tarvars Honorable (\"Pudgy\"), and Shanieka Tatum, who distributed directly to buyers. All of Ramos Rangel's associates deliberately concealed the nature of their activities, and used coded language and [[countersurveillance]] to avoid law enforcement detection.{{sfn|McCormack|2013|p=4}} \n\nAuthorities described the case against Ramos Rangel as atypical, as it involved an international criminal group, coordination among federal inmates, and the supply of a large quantity of cocaine to Arkansas. The value of the cocaine trafficked to Arkansas by Ramos Rangel's network is estimated at US$10&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"CwxYZ\" /> If Ramos Rangel is found guilty of the conspiracy charge, she faces a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence, up to life imprisonment, with up to US$10&nbsp;million in fines, and five years of mandatory supervised release. If found guilty of possession with intent to distribute less than {{Convert|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} of cocaine, the maximum sentence would be 20 years, a US$1&nbsp;million fine, and three years of supervised release. The charge of using a communication device to facilitate drug trafficking activities carries a maximum four-year sentence, US$250,000 in fines, and up to a year of supervised release.<ref name=\":5\"

His first two plays, ''Cause Maggie's Afraid of the Dark'' and ''Dreamstuff'', were met with mixed reviews. His play ''The Confirmation'' was produced in 1977 at Princeton's McCarter Theater and starred [[Herschel Bernardi]]. In 1977 he became the artistic director of the WPA Theater in New York. He met future collaborator [[Alan Menken]] at the [[BMI Workshop]], where he was classmates with [[Maury Yeston]] and [[Ed Kleban]], among others. He first worked with Menken on the 1979 musical ''[[Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'', adapted from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut]]'s [[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater|novel of the same name]].<ref name=\"VF\"/> They also collaborated on ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' with Ashman as director, lyricist, and librettist, winning the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]]. He also directed the workshop of ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'' by Yeston at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], and after asking why Guido's wife stays with him after she knows he has not been faithful, inspired Yeston to write \"My Husband Makes Movies\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGSajDdVRp8|title=ATW's Working in the Theatre #67 Playscript (Winter 1982)|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nAshman was director, lyricist and bookwriter for the 1986 Broadway musical ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' (music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]]).<ref name=\"VF\"/> Also in 1986, Ashman wrote the screenplay for the [[Frank Oz]]\u2013directed film adaptation of his musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as well as contributing the lyrics for two new songs, \"Some Fun Now\" and \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\" the latter of which received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 1986, Ashman was brought in to write lyrics for a song in Disney's ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While there, he was told about another project that they had been working on for a couple years. The film was ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', Disney's first fairy tale in 30 years. Ashman, along with [[Alan Menken]], wrote all of the songs for the film. Ashman became a driving force during the early years of the [[Disney Renaissance]]. He would hold story meetings and said the animation and musical styles were made for each other which is why Disney needed to continue making musical movies.<ref name=\"VF\"/> He also made strong choices in casting actors with strong musical theater and acting backgrounds. ''The Little Mermaid'' was released in November 1989 and it was an enormous success. Ashman and Menken received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations and three [[Academy Award]] nominations including two for \"[[Kiss the Girl|Kiss The Girl]]\" and \"[[Under The Sea]]\" with Ashman winning both awards for the latter.\n\nIn 1988, while working on ''The Little Mermaid'', Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' to Disney. After he wrote a group of songs with partner [[Alan Menken]], and a [[film treatment]], a screenplay was written by [[Linda Woolverton]], who had worked on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2005/aladdin-crew-reunion/|title=Aladdin: Crew Reunion|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> Directors [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] then joined the production, and the story underwent many changes, with some elements of the original treatment being dropped. Out of the 16 songs written for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', three of Ashman's songs ended up in the finished film, which was released after his death.\n\nDuring early production of ''Aladdin'', Ashman and Menken were approached to help reinvigorate and save the production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', which was going nowhere as a non-musical. Ashman, wishing to focus on ''Aladdin'' and his health, reluctantly agreed. It was at this time that his health began to decline due to his illness. Regardless, he completed lyrical work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' before succumbing to AIDS. The film was released mere months after his death and is dedicated to him.\n\nAlong with Menken, Ashman was the co-recipient of two [[Grammy Award]]s, two Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards. Upon receiving his second Academy Award posthumously, William P. \"Bill\" Lauch, his partner, accepted the award in his stead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://listverse.com/2011/12/01/top-10-notable-people-who-died-from-aids/|title=Top 10 Notable People Who Died From AIDS \u2013 Listverse|date=2011-12-01|work=Listverse|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nOn the night of the [[62nd Academy Awards]], Ashman told Menken that they needed to talk when they got back to New York, where he revealed to Menken that he was was sick, and was [[HIV]] positive. He had been diagnosed in 1988, halfway through production of ''The Little Mermaid''. During the making of ''Beauty and the Beast'', the Disney animators were flown to work with Ashman at his home in [[Fishkill, New York]]. He grew weaker but he remained productive and continued to write songs. After the first screening for ''Beauty and the Beast'' on March 10, 1991, the animators visited Ashman in the hospital. He weighed 80 pounds, had lost his sight, and could barely speak. The animators and producer [[Don Hahn]] told him that the film was incredibly well received by the press. On the early morning of March 14, Ashman, age 40, died from a [[heart failure]] caused by the HIV disease, in New York City''.''<ref name=\"times\">{{cite news|first=Eleanor|last=Blau|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/obituaries/howard-ashman-is-dead-at-40-writer-of-little-shop-of-horrors.html|title=Howard Ashman Is Dead at 40; Writer of 'Little Shop of Horrors'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=March 15, 1991}}</ref> ''Beauty and the Beast'' is dedicated  \"To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.

His first two plays, ''Cause Maggie's Afraid of the Dark'' and ''Dreamstuff'', were met with mixed reviews. His play ''The Confirmation'' was produced in 1977 at Princeton's McCarter Theater and starred [[Herschel Bernardi]]. In 1977 he became the artistic director of the WPA Theater in New York. He met future collaborator [[Alan Menken]] at the [[BMI Workshop]], where he was classmates with [[Maury Yeston]] and [[Ed Kleban]], among others. He first worked with Menken on the 1979 musical ''[[Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'', adapted from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut]]'s [[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater|novel of the same name]].<ref name=\"VF\"/> They also collaborated on ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' with Ashman as director, lyricist, and librettist, winning the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]]. He also directed the workshop of ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'' by Yeston at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], and after asking why Guido's wife stays with him after she knows he has not been faithful, inspired Yeston to write \"My Husband Makes Movies\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGSajDdVRp8|title=ATW's Working in the Theatre #67 Playscript (Winter 1982)|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nAshman was director, lyricist and bookwriter for the 1986 Broadway musical ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' (music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]]).<ref name=\"VF\"/> Also in 1986, Ashman wrote the screenplay for the [[Frank Oz]]\u2013directed film adaptation of his musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as well as contributing the lyrics for two new songs, \"Some Fun Now\" and \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\" the latter of which received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 1986, Ashman was brought in to write lyrics for a song in Disney's ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While there, he was told about another project that they had been working on for a couple years. The film was ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', Disney's first fairy tale in 30 years. Ashman, along with [[Alan Menken]], wrote all of the songs for the film. Ashman became a driving force during the early years of the [[Disney Renaissance]]. He would hold story meetings and said the animation and musical styles were made for each other which is why Disney needed to continue making musical movies.<ref name=\"VF\"/> He also made strong choices in casting actors with strong musical theater and acting backgrounds. ''The Little Mermaid'' was released in November 1989 and it was an enormous success. Ashman and Menken received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations and three [[Academy Award]] nominations including two for \"[[Kiss the Girl|Kiss The Girl]]\" and \"[[Under The Sea]]\" with Ashman winning both awards for the latter.\n\nIn 1988, while working on ''The Little Mermaid'', Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' to Disney. After he wrote a group of songs with partner [[Alan Menken]], and a [[film treatment]], a screenplay was written by [[Linda Woolverton]], who had worked on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2005/aladdin-crew-reunion/|title=Aladdin: Crew Reunion|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> Directors [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] then joined the production, and the story underwent many changes, with some elements of the original treatment being dropped. Out of the 16 songs written for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', three of Ashman's songs ended up in the finished film, which was released after his death.\n\nDuring early production of ''Aladdin'', Ashman and Menken were approached to help reinvigorate and save the production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', which was going nowhere as a non-musical. Ashman, wishing to focus on ''Aladdin'' and his health, reluctantly agreed. It was at this time that his health began to decline due to his illness. Regardless, he completed lyrical work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' before succumbing to AIDS. The film was released mere months after his death and is dedicated to him.\n\nAlong with Menken, Ashman was the co-recipient of two [[Grammy Award]]s, two Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards. Upon receiving his second Academy Award posthumously, William P. \"Bill\" Lauch, his partner, accepted the award in his stead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://listverse.com/2011/12/01/top-10-notable-people-who-died-from-aids/|title=Top 10 Notable People Who Died From AIDS \u2013 Listverse|date=2011-12-01|work=Listverse|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nOn the night of the [[62nd Academy Awards]], Ashman told Menken that they needed to talk when they got back to New York, where he revealed to Menken that he was was sick, and was [[HIV]] posotive. He had been diagnosed in 1988, halfway through production of ''The Little Mermaid''. During the making of ''Beauty and the Beast'', the Disney animators were flown to work with Ashman at his home in [[Fishkill, New York]]. He grew weaker but he remained productive and continued to write songs. After the first screening for ''Beauty and the Beast'' on March 10, 1991, the animators visited Ashman in the hospital. He weighed 80 pounds, had lost his sight, and could barely speak. The animators and producer [[Don Hahn]] told him that the film was incredibly well received by the press. On the early morning of March 14, Ashman, age 40, died from a [[heart failure]] caused by the HIV disease, in New York City''.''<ref name=\"times\">{{cite news|first=Eleanor|last=Blau|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/obituaries/howard-ashman-is-dead-at-40-writer-of-little-shop-of-horrors.html|title=Howard Ashman Is Dead at 40; Writer of 'Little Shop of Horrors'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=March 15, 1991}}</ref> ''Beauty and the Beast'' is dedicated  \"To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.

Although the Burgos and Caparispisan (Pagudpud) Windmills were built in 2013, many visitors still visit Bangui Windmills. Bangui Bay is also a tourist spot, yet not practical for swimming because of its deepness and water currents, but it is beautiful to view.

Although the Burgos and Caparispisan (Pagudpud) Windmills were built in 2013, many visitors still visit Bangui Windmills. Bangui Bay is also a tourist spot, yet not practical for swimming because of its deepness and water currents, but it is beautiful to view. There is also Abang Falls that can be found in Barangay Lanao, also a tourist spot.
