From humble beginnings, the [[Roman Republic]] (509 BCE to 27 BCE) and [[Roman Empire|empire]] (27 BCE to 476 CE) expanded to rule much of [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] and thus comprised many agricultural environments of which the [[Mediterranean climate]] of dry, hot summers and cool, rainy winters was the most common. Within the Mediterranean area, a triad of crops were most important: [[grain]]s, [[olive]]s, and [[Viticulture|grapes]].\n \nThe great majority of the people ruled by Rome were engaged in agriculture. From a beginning of small, largely self-sufficient landowners, rural society became dominated by [[latifundium]], large estates owned by the wealthy and utilizing mostly slave labor. The growth in the urban population, especially of the city of Rome, required the development of commercial markets and long-distance trade in agricultural products, especially grain, to supply the people in the cities with food.\n\n==The \"delightful\" life==\n\nAgriculture in ancient Rome was not only a necessity, but was idealized among the social elite as a way of life. [[Cicero]] considered farming the best of all Roman occupations. In his treatise ''[[De officiis|On Duties]]'', he declared that \"of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a free man.\" When one of his clients was derided in court for preferring a rural lifestyle, Cicero defended country life as \"the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice\" (parsimonia, diligentia, iustitia).<ref>''[[Pro Roscio Amerino]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0018%3Atext%3DS.%20Rosc.%3Asection%3D75 75.]</ref> [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Columella]], [[Varro]] and [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] wrote handbooks on farming practice.\n\nIn his treatise ''[[De Agri Cultura|De agricultura]]'' (\"On Farming\", 2nd century BC), Cato wrote that the best farms contained a [[Ancient Rome and wine|vineyard]], followed by an irrigated garden, willow plantation, olive orchard, meadow, grain land, forest trees, vineyard trained on trees, and lastly acorn woodlands.<ref name=\"Cato\">Cato the Censor, Columbia University Records of Civilization: On Farming, translated by Ernest Brehaut (Columbia University Press)</ref> Though Rome relied on resources from its many [[Roman province|provinces]] acquired through conquest and warfare, wealthy Romans developed the land in Italy to produce a variety of crops. \"The people living in the city of Rome constituted a huge market for the purchase of food produced on Italian farms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book |last=Hopkins |title=Conquerors and Slaves |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=1\u20139 |year=1978 |isbn=978-0521219457 }}</ref>\n\nLand ownership was a dominant factor in distinguishing the aristocracy from the common person, and the more land a Roman owned, the more important he would be in the city. Soldiers were often rewarded with land from the commander they served. Though farms depended on slave labor, free men and citizens were hired at farms to oversee the slaves and ensure that the farms ran smoothly.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Crops==\n===Grains===\nStaple crops in early Rome were [[millet]], and [[emmer]] and [[spelt]] which are species of wheat.  According to the Roman scholar [[Varro]], [[common wheat]] and [[durum wheat]] were introduced to [[Italy]] as crops about 450 BCE.<ref>Fussell, G. E.

Wheat was the preferred grain, but barley was widely eaten and also important as animal feed.<ref>Jasy, Naum (1950), \"The daily bread of the Ancient Greeks and Romans,\" ''Ostria,'', Vol. 9, pp. 231-233. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].</ref>\n\nIn ''De re Rustica'' [[Columella]] wrote that emmer was more resistant to moisture than wheat. According to Columella four types of emmer were cultivated, including one variety that he calls Clusian (named for the town [[Clusium]]).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.6.3-4</ref> Cato wrote that if sowing grain in humid or dewy soils was unavoidable, they should be sown alongside turnips, panic grass, millet and [[rape]].<ref>Cato, ''De Agricultura'', 6.1</ref>\n \nDespite listing [[panicum]] and millet among the [[legumes]] Columella says they should be considered grain crops \"for in many countries the peasants subsist on food made from them\".<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.9.17</ref>\n\n===Legumes===\nOf [[legumes]], Columella lists some that are preferred for cultivation: [[lentil]]s, [[pea]]s, ''[[lupinus]]'', [[bean]]s, [[cowpea]]s, and [[chickpea]]s (also listing [[sesame]], ''[[panicum]]'', [[cannabis]], [[barley]], and millet as legumes).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.1</ref> \n\nHe writes the following about ''lupinus'':<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.1</ref>\n<blockquote>\"...it requires the least labour, costs least, and of all crops that are sown is most beneficial to the land. For it affords an excellent fertilizer for worn out vineyards and ploughlands; it flourishes even in exhausted soil; and it endures age when laid away in the granary. When softened by boiling it is good fodder for cattle during the winter; in the case of humans, too, it serves to warn off famine if years of crop failures come upon them.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Olives===\nThe Romans grew olive trees in poor, rocky soils, and often in areas with sparse precipitation.  The tree is sensitive to freezing temperatures and intolerant of the colder weather of northern Europe and high, cooler elevations. The olive was grown mostly near the Mediterranean Sea.  The consumption of olive oil provided about 12 percent of the calories and about 80 percent of necessary fats in the diet of the average Roman.<ref>James ''et al'', p. 169</ref>\n\n===Grapes===\nViticulture was probably brought to southern Italy and Sicily by Greek colonists, but the [[Phoenicia]]ns of [[Carthage]] in northern [[Africa]] gave the Romans much of their knowledge of growing grapes and making wine. By 160 BCE, the cultivation of grapes on large estates using slave labor was common in Italy and wine was becoming a universal drink in the Roman empire.  To protect their wine industry, the Romans attempted to prohibit the cultivation of grapes outside Italy,<ref>\"Wine and Rome\", [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/wine.html], accessed 15 Nov 2018</ref> but by the 1st century CE, provinces such as [[Spain]] and [[Gaul]] (modern day France) were exporting wine to Italy.<ref>Casson, Lionel (1991), ''The Ancient Mariners,'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, pl 200.</ref>\n\n===Fodder===\nColumella mentions [[turnips]] as important, high-yielding food crop, especially in [[Gaul]] where they were used as winter fodder for [[cattle]].<ref>Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.22</ref> As other \"[[fodder]] crops\" he lists [[Medicago lupulina|Medic clover]], [[vetch]], barley, ''[[cytisus]]'', oats, chickpea and [[fenugreek]].<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.2</ref> Of Medic clover, he says it improves the soil, fattens lean cattle and is a high-yielding fodder crop.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.25</ref> \n\n[[Cato the Elder]] wrote that leaves from [[Populus|poplar]], [[elm]] and [[oak]] leaves should be gathered in the Fall before they have dried completely and stored for use as fodder.

Liquids produced for market like oil and wine were stored on the ground floor and grain was stored in lofts with hay and other [[fodder]]. He instructs that granaries be well venilated, cool, with minimal humidity, to prolong freshness. He describes certain methods of construction to avoid buildings developing cracks that would give animals and [[weevils]] access to the grains.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.9-1.6.17</ref>\n\nPress rooms, he advised, should be warm receiving light from the south to prevent the oil from freezing, which makes oil spoil faster. <ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.18</ref>\n\n==Land==\nColumella describes land as being classified into three types of terrain which he calls champaign (sloping [[plain]]s), hills with a gradual but gentle rise, and wooded, verdant mountain highlands. Of soil, he says there are six qualities: fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry. The permutations of these qualities producing many varieties of soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.1-3</ref> Columella quotes [[Vergil]]'s comment that loose soil is \"what we rival when we [[plough]]\". Of the most preferred types of soil he says the best is fat and loose soil that is the least costly and most productive, then fat and dense which is productive though requiring more effort, and after these are the moist soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.4-7</ref>\n\n==Farming practices==\n[[File:RomanHoeBlade.jpg|thumb|Roman hoe blade, from the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum in Chicago]]]]\nIn the 5th century BC, farms in Rome were small and family-owned. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] of this period, however, had started using [[crop rotation]] and had large estates. Rome's contact with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], Greece, and the Hellenistic East in the 3rd and 2nd centuries improved Rome's agricultural methods. Roman agriculture reached its height in productivity and efficiency during the late Republic and early Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Howatson |first=M.

Small farms were from 18\u2013108 iugera. (One [[iugerum]] was equal to about 0.65 acres or a quarter of a hectare). Medium-sized farms were from 80\u2013500 iugera. Large estates (called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'') were over 500 iugera.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book |last=White |first=K. D. |year=1970 |title=Roman Farming |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0801405754 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late Republican era, the number of ''latifundia'' increased. Wealthy Romans bought land from peasant farmers who could no longer make a living. Starting in 200 BC, the [[Punic Wars]] called peasant farmers away to fight for longer periods of time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Tim |year=1982 |title=Atlas of the Roman World |publisher=Facts on File |page=55 }}</ref> This is now disputed, some scholars now believe that large scale agriculture did not dominate Italian agriculture until the 1st century BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosenstein |first1=Nathan |title=Rome at War |date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Terranato |first1=Nicola |title=Republican Villas in the Suburbium of Rome in Roman Republican Villas |date=2012 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=69\u201393}}</ref>\n\nCows provided milk while oxen and mules did the heavy work on the farm. Sheep and goats were cheese producers and were prized for their hides. Horses were not widely used in farming, but were raised by the rich for racing or war. Sugar production centered on beekeeping, and some Romans raised snails as luxury food.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nThe Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; tenant farming or [[sharecropping]] in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm's produce; forced labour by slaves owned by aristocrats and supervised by slave managers; and other arrangements in which a farm was leased to a tenant.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n[[Cato the Elder]] (also known as \"Cato the Censor\") was a politician and statesman in the mid-to-late Roman Republic and described his view of a farm of 100 iugera in the de agricultura. He claimed such a farm should have \"a foreman, a foreman's wife, ten laborers, one ox driver, one donkey driver, one man in charge of the willow grove, one swineherd, in all sixteen persons; two oxen, two donkeys for wagon work, one donkey for the mill work.\" He also said that such a farm should have \"three presses fully equipped, storage jars in which five vintages amounting to eight hundred cullei can be stored, twenty storage jars for wine-press refuse, twenty for grain, separate coverings for the jars, six fiber-covered half [[amphorae]], four fiber-covered amphorae, two funnels, three basketwork strainers, [and] three strainers to dip up the flower, ten jars for [handling] the wine juice...\"<ref name=\"Cato\"/> It is important to note that Cato's description is not indicative of the majority of farms in the early 2nd century BC. The de agricultura is a political document designed to show off Cato's character as much as it is a practical guide.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Brendon |title=Cato's de agricultura and the Spectacle of Expertise in Roman Republican Villas |date=2012 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=61\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Trade==\nThere was much commerce between the provinces of the empire, and all regions of the empire were largely economically interdependent. Some provinces specialized in the production of grains including wheat, emmer, spelt, barley, and millet; others in [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and others in [[olive oil]], depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his ''Res Rustica'', \"Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for winter wheat and spelt. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry.\"<ref>Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, ''On Agriculture (Res Rustica)'', (Loeb Classical Library), Book II, p. 145</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote extensively about agriculture in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' from books XII to XIX, including chapter XVIII, The Natural History of Grain.<ref name=\"tufts1\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc | title=Pliny the Elder, the Natural History, BOOK I}}</ref>\n\nGreek geographer [[Strabo]] considered the [[Po Valley]] (northern Italy) to be the most important economically because \"all cereals do well, but the yield from millet is exceptional, because the soil is so well watered.\" The province of [[Etruria]] had heavy soil good for wheat. Volcanic soil in [[Campania]] made it well-suited for wine production. In addition to knowledge of different soil categories, the Romans also took interest in what type of manure was best for the soil. The best was poultry manure, and cow manure one of the worst.  Sheep and goat manure were also good. Donkey manure was best for immediate use, while horse manure wasn't good for grain crops, but according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], it was very good for meadows because \"it promotes a heavy growth of grass plants like grass.\"<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n==Economics==\nIn the grain-growing area of north Africa, centered on the ancient city of [[Carthage]], a family of six people needed to cultivate 12 [[Jugerum|iugera]]/ 3 [[hectares]] of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals).<ref name=\"Kehoe, D 1988\">{{cite book |last=Kehoe |first=D. |year=1988 |title=Economics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa |location=G\u00f6ttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |isbn=978-3525251881 }}</ref> If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera was needed. More land would be required to meet subsistence levels if the family farmed as [[sharecropper]]s. In [[Africa Proconsularis]] in the 2nd century AD, one-third of the total crop went to the landowner as rent<ref name=\"Kehoe, D 1988\"/> (See [[Lex Manciana]]).\n\nSuch figures detail only the subsistence level. It is clear that large scale surplus production was undertaken in some provinces, such as to supply the cities, especially Rome, with grain, a process known as the [[Cura Annonae]].\n[[Egypt]], northern Africa, and [[Sicily]] were the principal sources of grain to feed the population of Rome, estimated at one million people at its peak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rickman|first=G.E.|title=The Grain Trade Under the Roman Empire|journal=[[Memoirs from the American Academy in Rome]]|date=1980|volume=36|pages=263, 264}}.

Cicero indicates ''[[In Verrem]]'' a yield of 8:1 as normal, and 10:1 in exceptionally good harvest.  Paul Erdkamp mentions in his book ''The Grain Market in the Roman Empire'', that Columella was probably biased when he mentions a much lower yield of 4:1. According to Erdkamp, Columella wanted to make the point that \"grain offers little profit compared to wine. His argument induces him to exaggerate the profitability of vineyards and at the same time to diminish the yields that were obtained in grain cultivation. At best Columella provides a trustworthy figure for poor soils; at worst, his estimate is not reliable at all.\"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nAverage wheat yields per year in the 3rd decade of the century, sowing 135&nbsp;kg/ha of seed, were around 1,200&nbsp;kg/ha in Italy and Sicily, 1,710&nbsp;kg/ha in Egypt, 269&nbsp;kg/ha in [[Cyrenaica]], Tunisia at 400&nbsp;kg/ha, and Algeria at 540&nbsp;kg/ha, Greece at 620&nbsp;kg/ha.<ref>Hopkins , K.

Mechanical devices aided agriculture and the production of food. For example, extensive sets of [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s existed in [[Gaul]] and [[Rome]] at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at [[Barbegal]] in southern [[France]], near [[Arles]]. Sixteen overshot [[water wheel]]s arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century.<ref>[http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194648/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |date=2013-12-06 }}</ref> The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of [[flour]] per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time.<ref>[http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/lescourtils/provence/barbegal.htm La meunerie de Barbegal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical [[water wheels]] were well known to the Romans, described by [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De Architectura]]'' of 25 BC, and mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Naturalis Historia'' of AD 77. There are also later references to floating water mills from [[Byzantium]] and to [[sawmill]]s on the river [[Moselle]] by the poet [[Ausonius]]. The use of multiple stacked sequences of [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s was widespread in Roman mines.\n\nThere is evidence from bas-reliefs that farmers in northern Gaul (present day France) used a kind of automatic [[combine harvester|harvester]] or [[reaper]] when collecting ripe grain crops. The machine, called the \"vallus\" or \"gallic vallus\", was apparently invented and used by the [[Treveri]]<ref>King, Anthony (1990), ''Roman Gaul and Germany.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 1001-101</ref> people. It cut the [[ear (botany)|ears]] of grain without the [[straw]] and was pushed by [[oxen]] or horses. Pliny the Elder mentions the device in the ''Naturalis Historia'' XVIII, 296. Possibly because the vallus was cumbersome and expensive, its adoption never became widespread and it fell into disuse after the 4th century CE.<ref>White, K.D. (2010), ''Agricultural Implements of the Roman World Reissue Edition,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 160-171</ref> [[Scythe]]s and [[sickle]]s were the usual tools for harvesting crops.\n\n==Acquiring a farm==\n[[File:Roman harvester, Trier.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Gallo-Roman]] harvesting machine]]\nAristocrats and common people could acquire land for a farm in one of three ways. The most common way to gain land was to [[land ownership|purchase the land]]. Though some [[plebians|lower class citizens]] did own small pieces of land, they often found it too difficult and expensive to maintain. Because of the many difficulties of owning land, they would sell it to someone in the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|aristocracy]] who had the financial backing to support a farm. Though there were some public lands available to the common person for use, aristocrats also tended to purchase those pieces of land, which caused a great deal of tension between the two classes. \u201cMass eviction of the poor by the rich underlay the political tensions and civil wars of the last century of the Roman Republic.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Another way to acquire land was as a reward for going to war. High ranking [[Roman legions|soldiers]] returning from war would often be given small pieces of public land or land in provinces as a way of paying them for their services. The last way to obtain land was through inheritance. A father could leave his land to his family, usually to his son, in the event of his death. Wills were drawn out that specified who would receive the land as a way of ensuring that other citizens did not try to take the land from the family of the deceased.\n\n==Aristocracy and the controlled by the noble class of Rome. Land ownership was just one of many distinctions that set the aristocracy apart from the lower classes. Aristocracy would \"reorganize small holdings into larger more profitable farms in order to compete with other nobles.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  It was considered a point of pride to own not just the largest piece of land, but also to have land that grew high quality produce. As [[Marcus Cato]] wrote \"when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: 'Good husband good farmer'; it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\">[http:ing on the season, and focused on trying to acquire the best possible farm under the best possible conditions. Cato discusses many of the primary focuses of the farmer and how to distinguish a great piece of land. He notes that a good farmer must take precious time to examine the land, looking over every detail. Not only did the land need to be perfect for purchase, but the neighbors must maintain their farms as well because \"if the district was good, they should be well kept.\" Individuals looking to buy a piece of land had to also take into consideration the weather of the area, the condition of the soil, and how close the farm would be to a town or port. Careful planning went into every detail of owning and maintaining a farm in Roman culture.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/>\n\n==Running a farm in Rome==\nWhile the aristocracy owned most of the land in Rome, they often were not present at the farms. With obligations as senators, generals, and soldiers at war, many of the actual landowners spent very little time working on their farms. The farms instead were maintained by [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] and [[Freedman|freedmen]] paid to oversee those slaves.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> The overseer of the farm had many responsibilities that coincided with maintaining the land. He was responsible for ensuring that the slaves were kept busy and for resolving conflicts between them. An overseer had to be dependable and trustworthy in that the land owner had to know that the person he hired to run the farm was not going to try to steal any of the produce from the farm. Overseers were also responsible for ensuring that both servants and slaves were properly fed and housed, and that they were assigned work fairly and efficiently. They had to ensure that any orders given by the owner of the land were followed diligently and that everyone on the farm honored the [[Roman gods|gods]] completely and respectfully, which Romans believed was necessary to ensure a bountiful harvest. Good inscription evidence of how the system was organized is visible in the [[Lex Manciana]].\n\nThe majority of the work was done by servants and slaves. Slaves were the main source of labor. In Roman society, there were three main ways to obtain a slave. The first and possibly most common way to gain a slave was to [[Slave trade#Rome|buy one on the market]]. Slaves were purchased at auctions and slaves markets from dealers or were traded between individual slave owners. Another way slaves were acquired was through conquest in warfare. As [[Keith Hopkins]] explains in his writings, many landowners would go to war and bring back captives. These captives were then taken back to Roman territory and either sold to another citizen or made to work on the capturer's farm. The final way a slave could be obtained was through birth: if a female slave gave birth to a child, that child became property of the slave's owner. Extramarital relations with women who were not citizens was not considered to be [[adultery]] under [[Roman law]] (and Roman wives were expected to tolerate such behavior), so there was no legal or moral impediment to having children being fathered by a slave's owner or overseer.\n\nSlaves were relatively cheap to use because they were property;<ref>{{cite book |first=M.

Overseers motivated slaves by imposing punishments and by giving rewards. \"If the overseer sets his face against wrongdoing, they will not do it; if he allows it, the master must not let him go unpunished.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> Although outright cruelty to slaves was considered a mark of bad character in Roman culture, there were few limits on the punishments an overseer or slave-owner could inflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Problems for farmers==\nRoman farmers faced many of the problems which have historically affected farmers, including the unpredictability of weather, rainfall, and pests. Farmers also had to be wary of purchasing land too far away from a city or port because of war and land conflicts. As Rome was a vast empire that conquered many lands, it created enemies with individuals whose land had been taken. They would often lose their farms to the invaders who would take over and try to run the farms themselves.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Though Roman soldiers would often come to the aid of the farmers and try to regain the land, these fights often resulted in damaged or destroyed property. Land owners also faced problems with slave rebellions at times. \"In addition to invasions by Carthaginians and Celtic tribes, slaves rebellions and civil wars which were repeatedly fought on Italian soil all contributed to the destruction of traditional agricultural holdings.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> (pg. 4)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in ancient Greece]]\n*[[Byzantine agriculture]]\n*[[History of agriculture]]\n*[[Roman technology]]\n*[[Deforestation during the Roman period]]\n*[[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Modern sources===\n*Buck, Robert J.

From humble beginnings, the [[Roman Republic]] (509 BCE to 27 BCE) and [[Roman Empire|empire]] (27 BCE to 476 CE) expanded to rule much of [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] and thus comprised many agricultural environments of which the [[Mediterranean climate]] of dry, hot summers and cool, rainy winters was the most common. Within the Mediterranean area, a triad of crops were most important: [[grain]]s, [[olive]]s, and [[Viticulture|grapes]].\n \nThe great majority of the people ruled by Rome were engaged in agriculture. From a beginning of small, largely self-sufficient landowners, rural society became dominated by [[latifundium]], large estates owned by the wealthy and utilizing mostly slave labor. The growth in the urban population, especially of the city of Rome, required the development of commercial markets and long-distance trade in agricultural products, especially grain, to supply the people in the cities with food.\n\n==The \"delightful\" life==\n\nAgriculture in ancient Rome was not only a necessity, but was idealized among the social elite as a way of life. [[Cicero]] considered farming the best of all Roman occupations. In his treatise ''[[De officiis|On Duties]]'', he declared that \"of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a free man.\" When one of his clients was derided in court for preferring a rural lifestyle, Cicero defended country life as \"the teacher of economy, of industry, and of justice\" (parsimonia, diligentia, iustitia).<ref>''[[Pro Roscio Amerino]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0018%3Atext%3DS.%20Rosc.%3Asection%3D75 75.]</ref> [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Columella]], [[Varro]] and [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] wrote handbooks on farming practice.\n\nIn his treatise ''[[De Agri Cultura|De agricultura]]'' (\"On Farming\", 2nd century BC), Cato wrote that the best farms contained a [[Ancient Rome and wine|vineyard]], followed by an irrigated garden, willow plantation, olive orchard, meadow, grain land, forest trees, vineyard trained on trees, and lastly acorn woodlands.<ref name=\"Cato\">Cato the Censor, Columbia University Records of Civilization: On Farming, translated by Ernest Brehaut (Columbia University Press)</ref> Though Rome relied on resources from its many [[Roman province|provinces]] acquired through conquest and warfare, wealthy Romans developed the land in Italy to produce a variety of crops. \"The people living in the city of Rome constituted a huge market for the purchase of food produced on Italian farms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book |last=Hopkins |title=Conquerors and Slaves |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=1\u20139 |year=1978 |isbn=978-0521219457 }}</ref>\n\nLand ownership was a dominant factor in distinguishing the aristocracy from the common person, and the more land a Roman owned, the more important he would be in the city. Soldiers were often rewarded with land from the commander they served.

According to the Roman scholar [[Varro]], [[common wheat]] and [[durum wheat]] were introduced to [[Italy]] as crops about 450 BCE.<ref>Fussell, G. E.

Wheat was the preferred grain, but barley was widely eaten and also important as animal feed.<ref>Jasy, Naum (1950), \"The daily bread of the Ancient Greeks and Romans,\" ''Ostria,'', Vol. 9, pp. 231-233. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].</ref>\n\nIn ''De re Rustica'' [[Columella]] wrote that emmer was more resistant to moisture than wheat. According to Columella four types of emmer were cultivated, including one variety that he calls Clusian (named for the town [[Clusium]]).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.6.3-4</ref> Cato wrote that if sowing grain in humid or dewy soils was unavoidable, they should be sown alongside turnips, panic grass, millet and [[rape]].<ref>Cato, ''De Agricultura'', 6.1</ref>\n \nDespite listing [[panicum]] and millet among the [[legumes]] Columella says they should be considered grain crops \"for in many countries the peasants subsist on food made from them\".<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.9.17</ref>\n\n===Legumes===\nOf [[legumes]], Columella lists some that are preferred for cultivation: [[lentil]]s, [[pea]]s, ''[[lupinus]]'', [[bean]]s, [[cowpea]]s, and [[chickpea]]s (also listing [[sesame]], ''[[panicum]]'', [[cannabis]], [[barley]], and millet as legumes).<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.1</ref> \n\nHe writes the following about ''lupinus'':<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.1</ref>\n<blockquote>\"...it requires the least labour, costs least, and of all crops that are sown is most beneficial to the land. For it affords an excellent fertilizer for worn out vineyards and ploughlands; it flourishes even in exhausted soil; and it endures age when laid away in the granary. When softened by boiling it is good fodder for cattle during the winter; in the case of humans, too, it serves to warn off famine if years of crop failures come upon them.\"</blockquote>\n\n===Olives===\nThe Romans grew olive trees in poor, rocky soils, and often in areas with sparse precipitation.  The tree is sensitive to freezing temperatures and intolerant of the colder weather of northern Europe and high, cooler elevations. The olive was grown mostly near the Mediterranean Sea.  The consumption of olive oil provided about 12 percent of the calories and about 80 percent of necessary fats in the diet of the average Roman.<ref>James ''et al'', p. 169</ref>\n\n===Grapes===\nViticulture was probably brought to southern Italy and Sicily by Greek colonists, but the [[Phoenicia]]ns of [[Carthage]] in northern [[Africa]] gave the Romans much of their knowledge of growing grapes and making wine. By 160 BCE, the cultivation of grapes on large estates using slave labor was common in Italy and wine was becoming a universal drink in the Roman empire.  To protect their wine industry, the Romans attempted to prohibit the cultivation of grapes outside Italy,<ref>\"Wine and Rome\", [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/wine.html], accessed 15 Nov 2018</ref> but by the 1st century CE, provinces such as [[Spain]] and [[Gaul]] (modern day France) were exporting wine to Italy.<ref>Casson, Lionel (1991), ''The Ancient Mariners,'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, pl 200.</ref>\n\n===Fodder===\nColumella mentions [[turnips]] as important, high-yielding food crop, especially in [[Gaul]] where they were used as winter fodder for [[cattle]].<ref>Columella, De re Rustica, 2.10.22</ref> As other \"[[fodder]] crops\" he lists [[Medicago lupulina|Medic clover]], [[vetch]], barley, ''[[cytisus]]'', oats, chickpea and [[fenugreek]].<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.7.2</ref> Of Medic clover, he says it improves the soil, fattens lean cattle and is a high-yielding fodder crop.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.10.25</ref> \n\n[[Cato the Elder]] wrote that leaves from [[Populus|poplar]], [[elm]] and [[oak]] leaves should be gathered in the Fall before they have dried completely and stored for use as fodder.

Liquids produced for market like oil and wine were stored on the ground floor and grain was stored in lofts with hay and other [[fodder]]. He instructs that granaries be well venilated, cool, with minimal humidity, to prolong freshness. He describes certain methods of construction to avoid buildings developing cracks that would give animals and [[weevils]] access to the grains.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.9-1.6.17</ref>\n\nPress rooms, he advised, should be warm receiving light from the south to prevent the oil from freezing, which makes oil spoil faster. <ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 1.6.18</ref>\n\n==Land==\nColumella describes land as being classified into three types of terrain which he calls champaign (sloping [[plain]]s), hills with a gradual but gentle rise, and wooded, verdant mountain highlands. Of soil, he says there are six qualities: fat or lean, loose or compact, moist or dry. The permutations of these qualities producing many varieties of soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.1-3</ref> Columella quotes [[Vergil]]'s comment that loose soil is \"what we rival when we [[plough]]\". Of the most preferred types of soil he says the best is fat and loose soil that is the least costly and most productive, then fat and dense which is productive though requiring more effort, and after these are the moist soils.<ref>Columella, ''De re Rustica'', 2.2.4-7</ref>\n\n==Farming practices==\n[[File:RomanHoeBlade.jpg|thumb|Roman hoe blade, from the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum in Chicago]]]]\nIn the 5th century BC, farms in Rome were small and family-owned. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] of this period, however, had started using [[crop rotation]] and had large estates. Rome's contact with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], Greece, and the Hellenistic East in the 3rd and 2nd centuries improved Rome's agricultural methods. Roman agriculture reached its height in productivity and efficiency during the late Republic and early Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Howatson |first=M.

Small farms were from 18\u2013108 iugera. (One [[iugerum]] was equal to about 0.65 acres or a quarter of a hectare). Medium-sized farms were from 80\u2013500 iugera.

Sheep and goats were cheese producers and were prized for their hides. Horses were not widely used in farming, but were raised by the rich for racing or war. Sugar production centered on beekeeping, and some Romans raised snails as luxury food.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nThe Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; tenant farming or [[sharecropping]] in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm's produce; forced labour by slaves owned by aristocrats and supervised by slave managers; and other arrangements in which a farm was leased to a tenant.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n[[Cato the Elder]] (also known as \"Cato the Censor\") was a politician and statesman in the mid-to-late Roman Republic and described his view of a farm of 100 iugera in the de agricultura. He claimed such a farm should have \"a foreman, a foreman's wife, ten laborers, one ox driver, one donkey driver, one man in charge of the willow grove, one swineherd, in all sixteen persons; two oxen, two donkeys for wagon work, one donkey for the mill work.\" He also said that such a farm should have \"three presses fully equipped, storage jars in which five vintages amounting to eight hundred cullei can be stored, twenty storage jars for wine-press refuse, twenty for grain, separate coverings for the jars, six fiber-covered half [[amphorae]], four fiber-covered amphorae, two funnels, three basketwork strainers, [and] three strainers to dip up the flower, ten jars for [handling] the wine juice...\"<ref name=\"Cato\"/> It is important to note that Cato's description is not indicative of the majority of farms in the early 2nd century BC.

Some provinces specialized in the production of grains including wheat, emmer, spelt, barley, and millet; others in [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] and others in [[olive oil]], depending on the soil type. Columella writes in his ''Res Rustica'', \"Soil that is heavy, chalky, and wet is not unsuited to the growing for winter wheat and spelt. Barley tolerates no place except one that is loose and dry.\"<ref>Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, ''On Agriculture (Res Rustica)'', (Loeb Classical Library), Book II, p. 145</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote extensively about agriculture in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' from books XII to XIX, including chapter XVIII, The Natural History of Grain.<ref name=\"tufts1\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc | title=Pliny the Elder, the Natural History, BOOK I}}</ref>\n\nGreek geographer [[Strabo]] considered the [[Po Valley]] (northern Italy) to be the most important economically because \"all cereals do well, but the yield from millet is exceptional, because the soil is so well watered.\" The province of [[Etruria]] had heavy soil good for wheat. Volcanic soil in [[Campania]] made it well-suited for wine production. In addition to knowledge of different soil categories, the Romans also took interest in what type of manure was best for the soil. The best was poultry manure, and cow manure one of the worst.  Sheep and goat manure were also good. Donkey manure was best for immediate use, while horse manure wasn't good for grain crops, but according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], it was very good for meadows because \"it promotes a heavy growth of grass plants like grass.\"<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n==Economics==\nIn the grain-growing area of north Africa, centered on the ancient city of [[Carthage]], a family of six people needed to cultivate 12 [[Jugerum|iugera]]/ 3 [[hectares]] of land to meet minimum food requirements (without animals).<ref name=\"Kehoe, D 1988\">{{cite book |last=Kehoe |first=D. |year=1988 |title=Economics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa |location=G\u00f6ttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |isbn=978-3525251881 }}</ref> If a family owned animals to help cultivate land, then 20 iugera was needed.

According to Erdkamp, Columella wanted to make the point that \"grain offers little profit compared to wine.

Mechanical devices aided agriculture and the production of food. For example, extensive sets of [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s existed in [[Gaul]] and [[Rome]] at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at [[Barbegal]] in southern [[France]], near [[Arles]]. Sixteen overshot [[water wheel]]s arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated from the end of the 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century.<ref>[http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 Ville d'Histoire et de Patrimoine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194648/http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice_histoire&id=95 |date=2013-12-06 }}</ref> The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of [[flour]] per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time.<ref>[http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/lescourtils/provence/barbegal.htm La meunerie de Barbegal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nVertical [[water wheels]] were well known to the Romans, described by [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De Architectura]]'' of 25 BC, and mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Naturalis Historia'' of AD 77. There are also later references to floating water mills from [[Byzantium]] and to [[sawmill]]s on the river [[Moselle]] by the poet [[Ausonius]]. The use of multiple stacked sequences of [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s was widespread in Roman mines.\n\nThere is evidence from bas-reliefs that farmers in northern Gaul (present day France) used a kind of automatic [[combine harvester|harvester]] or [[reaper]] when collecting ripe grain crops. The machine, called the \"vallus\" or \"gallic vallus\", was apparently invented and used by the [[Treveri]]<ref>King, Anthony (1990), ''Roman Gaul and Germany.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 1001-101</ref> people. It cut the [[ear (botany)|ears]] of grain without the [[straw]] and was pushed by [[oxen]] or horses. Pliny the Elder mentions the device in the ''Naturalis Historia'' XVIII, 296. Possibly because the vallus was cumbersome and expensive, its adoption never became widespread and it fell into disuse after the 4th century CE.<ref>White, K.D. (2010), ''Agricultural Implements of the Roman World Reissue Edition,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 160-171</ref> [[Scythe]]s and [[sickle]]s were the usual tools for harvesting crops.\n\n==Acquiring a farm==\n[[File:Roman harvester, Trier.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Gallo-Roman]] harvesting machine]]\nAristocrats and common people could acquire land for a farm in one of three ways. The most common way to gain land was to [[land ownership|purchase the land]]. Though some [[plebians|lower class citizens]] did own small pieces of land, they often found it too difficult and expensive to maintain. Because of the many difficulties of owning land, they would sell it to someone in the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|aristocracy]] who had the financial backing to support a farm. Though there were some public lands available to the common person for use, aristocrats also tended to purchase those pieces of land, which caused a great deal of tension between the two classes. \u201cMass eviction of the poor by the rich underlay the political tensions and civil wars of the last century of the Roman Republic.\u201d<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Another way to acquire land was as a reward for going to war. High ranking [[Roman legions|soldiers]] returning from war would often be given small pieces of public land or land in provinces as a way of paying them for their services. The last way to obtain land was through inheritance. A father could leave his land to his family, usually to his son, in the event of his death. Wills were drawn out that specified who would receive the land as a way of ensuring that other citizens did not try to take the land from the family of the deceased.\n\n==Aristocracy and the land==\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|Cato the Elder, author of a book on Roman agriculture]]\n\nThough some small farms were owned by lower class citizens and soldiers, much of the land was controlled by the noble class of Rome. Land ownership was just one of many distinctions that set the aristocracy apart from the lower classes. Aristocracy would \"reorganize small holdings into larger more profitable farms in order to compete with other nobles.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  It was considered a point of pride to own not just the largest piece of land, but also to have land that grew high quality produce. As [[Marcus Cato]] wrote \"when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: 'Good husband good farmer'; it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\">[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/A*.html Marcus Cato, ''On Agriculture'', 1-2,5]</ref> The farms would produce a variety of crops depending on the season, and focused on trying to acquire the best possible farm under the best possible conditions. Cato discusses many of the primary focuses of the farmer and how to distinguish a great piece of land. He notes that a good farmer must take precious time to examine the land, looking over every detail. Not only did the land need to be perfect for purchase, but the neighbors must maintain their farms as well because \"if the district was good, they should be well kept.\" Individuals looking to buy a piece of land had to also take into consideration the weather of the area, the condition of the soil, and how close the farm would be to a town or port. Careful planning went into every detail of owning and maintaining a farm in Roman culture.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/>\n\n==Running a farm in Rome==\nWhile the aristocracy owned most of the land in Rome, they often were not present at the farms. With obligations as senators, generals, and soldiers at war, many of the actual landowners spent very little time working on their farms. The farms instead were maintained by [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] and [[Freedman|freedmen]] paid to oversee those slaves.<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> The overseer of the farm had many responsibilities that coincided with maintaining the land. He was responsible for ensuring that the slaves were kept busy and for resolving conflicts between them. An overseer had to be dependable and trustworthy in that the land owner had to know that the person he hired to run the farm was not going to try to steal any of the produce from the farm. Overseers were also responsible for ensuring that both servants and slaves were properly fed and housed, and that they were assigned work fairly and efficiently. They had to ensure that any orders given by the owner of the land were followed diligently and that everyone on the farm honored the [[Roman gods|gods]] completely and respectfully, which Romans believed was necessary to ensure a bountiful harvest. Good inscription evidence of how the system was organized is visible in the [[Lex Manciana]].\n\nThe majority of the work was done by servants and slaves. Slaves were the main source of labor. In Roman society, there were three main ways to obtain a slave. The first and possibly most common way to gain a slave was to [[Slave trade#Rome|buy one on the market]]. Slaves were purchased at auctions and slaves markets from dealers or were traded between individual slave owners. Another way slaves were acquired was through conquest in warfare. As [[Keith Hopkins]] explains in his writings, many landowners would go to war and bring back captives. These captives were then taken back to Roman territory and either sold to another citizen or made to work on the capturer's farm. The final way a slave could be obtained was through birth: if a female slave gave birth to a child, that child became property of the slave's owner. Extramarital relations with women who were not citizens was not considered to be [[adultery]] under [[Roman law]] (and Roman wives were expected to tolerate such behavior), so there was no legal or moral impediment to having children being fathered by a slave's owner or overseer.\n\nSlaves were relatively cheap to use because they were property;<ref>{{cite book |first=M. I. |last=Finley |quote=a slave is property, subject to the rules and procedures of property, with respect to sale, lease, theft, natural increase and so on. |title=The Ancient Economy |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_oMmyO465s9oC |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_oMmyO465s9oC/page/n57 62] |isbn=978-0520024366 }}</ref> their treatment depended on the humanity of their owners, who met the needs of their slaves on what they cared to spend, not what they had to. Overseers motivated slaves by imposing punishments and by giving rewards. \"If the overseer sets his face against wrongdoing, they will not do it; if he allows it, the master must not let him go unpunished.\"<ref name=\"Cato-1\"/> Although outright cruelty to slaves was considered a mark of bad character in Roman culture, there were few limits on the punishments an overseer or slave-owner could inflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Problems for farmers==\nRoman farmers faced many of the problems which have historically affected farmers, including the unpredictability of weather, rainfall, and pests. Farmers also had to be wary of purchasing land too far away from a city or port because of war and land conflicts. As Rome was a vast empire that conquered many lands, it created enemies with individuals whose land had been taken. They would often lose their farms to the invaders who would take over and try to run the farms themselves.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Though Roman soldiers would often come to the aid of the farmers and try to regain the land, these fights often resulted in damaged or destroyed property. Land owners also faced problems with slave rebellions at times. \"In addition to invasions by Carthaginians and Celtic tribes, slaves rebellions and civil wars which were repeatedly fought on Italian soil all contributed to the destruction of traditional agricultural holdings.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> (pg. 4)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in ancient Greece]]\n*[[Byzantine agriculture]]\n*[[History of agriculture]]\n*[[Roman technology]]\n*[[Deforestation during the Roman period]]\n*[[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Modern sources===\n*Buck, Robert J.

The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience,<ref name=\"critiquecircle.com\"/> and is frequently the [[punch line]] of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals\u2014such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead\u2014where the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nThe comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' - \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriple|title=The Triple|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nJust like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/comedy-writing-secrets-triples|title=Comedy Writing Secrets: Triple the Funny|last=Henshey|first=Chelsea|date=2016-02-11|website=WritersDigest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==Fairy tales==\nIn [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts.

Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \"on the other hand\" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that \"No, there is no other hand.\"\n* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.\n\n==Rhetoric and public speaking==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory.

The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience,<ref name=\"critiquecircle.com\"/> and is frequently the [[punch line]] of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals\u2014such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead\u2014where the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nThe comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' - \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriple|title=The Triple|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nJust like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/comedy-writing-secrets-triples|title=Comedy Writing Secrets: Triple the Funny|last=Henshey|first=Chelsea|date=2016-02-11|website=WritersDigest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==Fairy tales==\nIn [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts.

The district headquarter  is located at [[North Lakhimpur]]. The district is bounded on the North by Siang and Papumpare District of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and on the East by Dhemaji District and Subansiri River. [[Majuli]] District stands on the Southern side and [[Biswanath district|Biswanath]] District is on the West.\n\n== History ==\nLakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where tribes from the east first reached the [[Brahmaputra]]. The most prominent of them was the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya rulers]] who held the areas of the present district for long, until the outbreak of the Ahom-Chutiya war in the 16th century and eventually the area came under the rule of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom dynasty]]. The Ahoms created a new position called ''Bhatialia Gohain'' to control the region. The area was later given by Ahoms to the [[Baro-Bhuyan]]s to rule like feudal lords, as they had helped defeat the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Kachari]] kingdoms. There was a Chutia principality formed by the king Lakshminarayan in the start of the 15th century upon which the district has been named. The copperplate inscription of a land grant given by the Chutia king in the year 1403 A.D. in the west of the Subansiri rive(Swarnadi) as well as the ruins between Dhal and Ghagar rivers(near present-day North Lakhimpur town) shows the evidence of the settlement. The [[Bamar|Burmese]], who had ruined the native kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, was in 1826 expelled by the [[United Kingdom|British]] under the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]]. They placed the southern part of the state, together with [[Sivasagar]] under the rule of Raja Purandhar Singh; but it was not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British Administration.\n\nLakhimpur district used to have several other districts of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] within its fold and was known as the '''Lakhimpur Frontier Tract'''. After independence, the district contained the present day [[Dibrugarh district]], [[Tinsukia district]] and [[Dhemaji district]]. Its headquarter was at [[Dibrugarh]].\n\nIn 1976, [[Dibrugarh district]] was separated from Lakhimpur.<ref name='Statoids'>{{cite web | url = http://www.statoids.com/yin.html | title = Districts of India | accessdate = 2011-10-11 | last = Law | first = Gwillim | date = 2011-09-25 | work = Statoids}}</ref> This was repeated on 14 October 1989, with the formation of [[Dhemaji district]].<ref name='Statoids'/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Lakhimpur'' was derived from the name \"Lakshmipur\" which was given by the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] king named Lakshminaryan who ruled during the 15th century. Later, it was changed by the [[Baro-Bhuyan]]s to Lakhimpur, when they were made feudal lords of the region by the [[Ahom dynasty|Ahoms]] after defeating the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya kings]] and was kept in memory of the land (in present-day Darrang district), which they lost to the Koch kingdom.\n\n==Geography==\nLakhimpur district occupies an area of {{convert|2277|km2|sqmi}},<ref name='Reference Annual'>{{cite book | last1 = Srivastava, Dayawanti et al.

It is bounded on the North by Lower Subansiri and Papumpare Districts of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and on the East by [[Dhemaji District]]. [[Majuli]], the largest river-island district is on the South and [[Biswanath District]] is on the West. The [[Brahmaputra]] is navigable for steamers in all seasons as far as [[Dibrugarh]], in the rainy season as far as [[Sadiya]]; its navigable tributaries within the district are the Subansiri, Ranganadi, and Dikrong. The exact location of the district is 26.48\u2019 and 27.53\u2019 Northern latitude and 93.42\u2019 and 94.20' East longitude (approx.).\n\nThe district has three sub divisions -- [[Dhakuakhana]], Narayanpur-Bihpuria and North Lakhimpur (sadar). Lakhimpur district has eight Police stations. viz. North Lakhimpur, Boginadi, [[Panigaon]], [[Dhakuakhana]] , [[Ghilamara]], Narayanpur, Laluk and [[Bihpuria]].\n\nForests are mainly tropical rain forest. Important reserved forests includes Ranga Reserve, Kakoi Reserve, Dulung Reserve and Pabho Reserve. Some varieties are Hollokh ([[Terminalia myriocarpa]]), Ajhar ([[Lagerstroemia speciosa]]), Simolu ([[Bombax ceiba]] or [[Salmalia malabarica]]), Sum ([[Machilus]]), Gomari ([[Gmelina arborea]]), Sisu ([[Dalbergia sissoo]]), Silikha ([[Terminalia chebula]]), Neem ([[Azadirachta indica]]), Nahar ([[Mesua ferrea]]) etc. Wild elephants, buffaloes, tigers, deer etc. are there in the forests. Varieties of bird species are observed in swampy areas.\n\nThe great [[Subansiri River]] has legends of once famous gold washing. But as of now, there is no any major exploration of minerals in the district, except some minor exploration for petroleum by ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) near [[Dhakuakhana]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Lakhimpur is mainly based on agriculture. Major crops are rice, tea, mustard, sugarcane, etc. A small number of SSc and MSc industries<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cleartax.in/s/small-scale-industries-ssi|publisher=cleartax|title=Small Scale Industries ( SSI ) \u2013 Characteristics, Objectives, Registration of SSI|date=9 March 2020|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/mediumscale-industry-17687.html|title=What Is a Medium-Scale Industry?|publisher=Chron|date=19 December 2018|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>are located in the district.\n\n==Divisions==\nThere are four [[Assam Legislative Assembly]] constituencies in this district: Bihpuria, Naoboicha, Lakhimpur, and [[Dhakuakhana]].<ref name=\"ceo1\">{{cite web|title=List of Assembly Constituencies showing their Revenue & Election District wise break - up |url=http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.1%20-%20DEOs%20wise%20ACs%20breakup.pdf |publisher=Chief Electoral Officer, Assam website |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322074811/http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.1%20-%20DEOs%20wise%20ACs%20breakup.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}</ref> Dhakuakhana is designated for [[scheduled tribe]]s.<ref name=\"ceo1\"/> Bihpuria is in the [[Tezpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Tezpur Lok Sabha constituency]], whilst the other three are in the [[Lakhimpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Lakhimpur Lok Sabha constituency]].<ref name=\"ceo2\">{{cite web|title=List of Assembly Constituencies showing their Parliamentary Constituencies wise break - up |url=http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.2%20-%20PC-wise%20LAC%20breakup.pdf |publisher=Chief Electoral Officer, Assam website |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322074903/http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.2%20-%20PC-wise%20LAC%20breakup.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=73,409|13=1911|14=92,708|15=1921|16=1,24,296|17=1931|18=1,54,021|19=1941|20=1,88,977|21=1951|22=2,22,883|23=1961|24=3,35,346|25=1971|26=4,80,838|27=1991|28=7,51,517|29=2001|30=8,89,010|31=2011|32=10,42,137|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}\n\n===Population===\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Lakhimpur district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 1,042,137,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Cyprus]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nCyprus 1,120,489 July 2011 est.\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

The district headquarter  is located at [[North Lakhimpur]]. The district is bounded on the North by Siang and Papumpare District of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and on the East by Dhemaji District and Subansiri River. [[Majuli]] District stands on the Southern side and [[Biswanath district|Biswanath]] District is on the West.\n\n== History ==\nLakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where tribes from the east first reached the [[Brahmaputra]]. The most prominent of them was the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya rulers]] who held the areas of the present district for long, until the outbreak of the Ahom-Chutiya war in the 16th century and eventually the area came under the rule of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom dynasty]]. The area was later given by Ahoms to the [[Baro-Bhuyan]]s to rule like feudal lords, as they had helped defeat the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Kachari]] kingdoms. There was a Chutia principality formed by the king Lakshminarayan in the start of the 15th century upon which the district has been named. The copperplate inscription of a land grant given by the Chutia king in the year 1403 A.D. in the west of the Subansiri rive(Swarnadi) as well as the ruins between Dhal and Ghagar rivers(near present-day North Lakhimpur town) shows the evidence of the settlement. The [[Bamar|Burmese]], who had ruined the native kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, was in 1826 expelled by the [[United Kingdom|British]] under the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]]. They placed the southern part of the state, together with [[Sivasagar]] under the rule of Raja Purandhar Singh; but it was not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British Administration.\n\nLakhimpur district used to have several other districts of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] within its fold and was known as the '''Lakhimpur Frontier Tract'''. After independence, the district contained the present day [[Dibrugarh district]], [[Tinsukia district]] and [[Dhemaji district]]. Its headquarter was at [[Dibrugarh]].\n\nIn 1976, [[Dibrugarh district]] was separated from Lakhimpur.<ref name='Statoids'>{{cite web | url = http://www.statoids.com/yin.html | title = Districts of India | accessdate = 2011-10-11 | last = Law | first = Gwillim | date = 2011-09-25 | work = Statoids}}</ref> This was repeated on 14 October 1989, with the formation of [[Dhemaji district]].<ref name='Statoids'/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Lakhimpur'' was derived from the name \"Lakshmipur\" which was given by the Chutiya king named Lakshminaryan who ruled during the 15th century. Later, it was changed by the [[Baro-Bhuyan]]s to Lakhimpur, when they were made feudal lords of the region by the [[Ahom dynasty|Ahoms]] after defeating the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya kings]] and was kept in memory of the land (in present-day Darrang district), which they lost to the Koch kingdom.\n\n==Geography==\nLakhimpur district occupies an area of {{convert|2277|km2|sqmi}},<ref name='Reference Annual'>{{cite book | last1 = Srivastava, Dayawanti et al.

It is bounded on the North by Lower Subansiri and Papumpare Districts of the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and on the East by [[Dhemaji District]]. [[Majuli]], the largest river-island district is on the South and [[Biswanath District]] is on the West. The [[Brahmaputra]] is navigable for steamers in all seasons as far as [[Dibrugarh]], in the rainy season as far as [[Sadiya]]; its navigable tributaries within the district are the Subansiri, Ranganadi, and Dikrong. The exact location of the district is 26.48\u2019 and 27.53\u2019 Northern latitude and 93.42\u2019 and 94.20' East longitude (approx.).\n\nThe district has three sub divisions -- [[Dhakuakhana]], [[Narayanpur-Bihpuria]] and North Lakhimpur (sadar). Lakhimpur district has eight Police stations. viz. North Lakhimpur, [[Boginadi]], [[Panigaon]], [[Dhakuakhana]] , [[Ghilamara]], Narayanpur, [[Laluk, Assam|Laluk]] and [[Bihpuria]].\n\nForests are mainly tropical rain forest. Important reserved forests includes [[Ranga Reserve]], [[Kakoi Reserve]], [[Dulung Reserve]] and [[Pabho Reserve]]. Some varieties are Hollokh ([[Terminalia myriocarpa]]), Ajhar ([[Lagerstroemia speciosa]]), Simolu ([[Bombax ceiba]] or [[Salmalia malabarica]]), Sum ([[Machilus]]), Gomari ([[Gmelina arborea]]), Sisu ([[Dalbergia sissoo]]), Silikha ([[Terminalia chebula]]), Neem ([[Azadirachta indica]]), Nahar ([[Mesua ferrea]]) etc. Wild elephants, buffaloes, tigers, deer etc. are there in the forests. Varieties of bird species are observed in swampy areas.\n\nThe great [[Subansiri River]] has legends of once famous gold washing. But as of now, there is no any major exploration of minerals in the district, except some minor exploration for petroleum by ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) near [[Dhakuakhana]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Lakhimpur is mainly based on agriculture. Major crops are rice, tea, mustard, sugarcane, etc. A small number of SSc and MSc industries<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cleartax.in/s/small-scale-industries-ssi|publisher=cleartax|title=Small Scale Industries ( SSI ) \u2013 Characteristics, Objectives, Registration of SSI|date=9 March 2020|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/mediumscale-industry-17687.html|title=What Is a Medium-Scale Industry?|publisher=Chron|date=19 December 2018|access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>are located in the district.\n\n==Divisions==\nThere are four [[Assam Legislative Assembly]] constituencies in this district: Bihpuria, Naoboicha, Lakhimpur, and [[Dhakuakhana]].<ref name=\"ceo1\">{{cite web|title=List of Assembly Constituencies showing their Revenue & Election District wise break - up |url=http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.1%20-%20DEOs%20wise%20ACs%20breakup.pdf |publisher=Chief Electoral Officer, Assam website |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322074811/http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.1%20-%20DEOs%20wise%20ACs%20breakup.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}</ref> Dhakuakhana is designated for [[scheduled tribe]]s.<ref name=\"ceo1\"/> Bihpuria is in the [[Tezpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Tezpur Lok Sabha constituency]], whilst the other three are in the [[Lakhimpur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Lakhimpur Lok Sabha constituency]].<ref name=\"ceo2\">{{cite web|title=List of Assembly Constituencies showing their Parliamentary Constituencies wise break - up |url=http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.2%20-%20PC-wise%20LAC%20breakup.pdf |publisher=Chief Electoral Officer, Assam website |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322074903/http://ceoassam.nic.in/Gen_Informations/2.2%20-%20PC-wise%20LAC%20breakup.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=73,409|13=1911|14=92,708|15=1921|16=1,24,296|17=1931|18=1,54,021|19=1941|20=1,88,977|21=1951|22=2,22,883|23=1961|24=3,35,346|25=1971|26=4,80,838|27=1991|28=7,51,517|29=2001|30=8,89,010|31=2011|32=10,42,137|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}\n\n===Population===\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Lakhimpur district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 1,042,137,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Cyprus]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nCyprus 1,120,489 July 2011 est.\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

Some cultural activities and festivals are associated with ancient tribal gods and rites, but many of them are no longer performed since the spread of Christianity.\n\n== Festival ==\nThe new yam festival is a solemn occasion and starts with the planting season in March when the chief priest and elders start the planting of yams. Before the first yam is planted, elders pay homage to their traditional ruler or chief, the Dede Igbo, who is the custodian of tradition and the ancestral father of the Omuma [[Igbo people]].\n\nTop members of the Igbo people, such as high chiefs, titleholders, respected elders, and important personalities in the community, form an entourage to make the journey to the Dede. When this entourage arrives at the Ezeonomobi Igbo, the members are usually received by the leader according to cultural tradition, by presenting them locally brewed palm wine, kola nut, and white clay, which is first offered to the gods as supplication before the visitors.\n\nThe group conducts brief discussions and prayers. The conventional calendar puts the planting season in January, while the Igbo calendar, which is agrarian, is called the first Eke and starts in February, known as Onwa Mmiri Nda Afo.\n\nIn Igbo areas, yam is an important economic crop, highly favored and a regular staple in most homes. The yam is considered the chief crop and forerunner of other crops in the region. The planting season begins in the first week of February and the crop usually takes six months to mature, making the festival period between late July and early August when the valuable crop is harvested.\n\n== Education ==\n\n=== Secondary schools ===\n*Divine Favour Secondary School, Omuma\n*Omuma Technical College, Omuma\n*Omuma community school, Omuma\n*Uche Stenography Academy, Umuhu-Omuma\n*Holy Trinity Secondary School, Omuma\n\n=== Primary schools ===\n*Ozuh primary school, Ozuh-Omuma\n*Abia Central School, Abia-Omuma\n*Community Primary School, Amaodum Etiti-Omuma\n*Umuhu Primary School, Umuhu-Omuma\n*Powerline Primary School, Abia-Omuma\n*Omuma Central School, Omuma\n\n== Economy ==\nOmuma sits in the rain forest and produces many agricultural products, such as yams, cassava, taro, ona, corn, rubber, and palm.

Some cultural activities and festivals are associated with ancient tribal gods and rites, but many of them are no longer performed since the spread of Christianity.\n\n== Festival ==\nThe new yam festival is a solemn occasion and starts with the planting season in March when the chief priest and elders start the planting of yams. Before the first yam is planted, elders pay homage to their traditional ruler or chief, the Dede Igbo, who is the custodian of tradition and the ancestral father of the Omuma [[Igbo people]].\n\nTop members of the Igbo people, such as high chiefs, titleholders, respected elders, and important personalities in the community, form an entourage to make the journey to the Dede. When this entourage arrives at the Ezeonomobi Igbo, the members are usually received by the leader according to cultural tradition, by presenting them locally brewed palm wine, kola nut, and white clay, which is first offered to the gods as supplication before the visitors.\n\nThe group conducts brief discussions and prayers. The conventional calendar puts the planting season in January, while the Igbo calendar, which is agrarian, is called the first Eke and starts in February, known as Onwa Mmiri Nda Afo.\n\nIn Igbo areas, yam is an important economic crop, highly favored and a regular staple in most homes. The yam is considered the chief crop and forerunner of other crops in the region. The planting season begins in the first week of February and the crop usually takes six months to mature, making the festival period between late July and early August when the valuable crop is harvested.\n\n== Education ==\n\n=== Secondary schools ===\n*Divine Favour Secondary School, Omuma\n*Omuma Technical College, Omuma\n*Omuma community school, Omuma\n*Uche Stenography Academy, Umuhu-Omuma\n*Holy Trinity Secondary School, Omuma\n\n=== Primary schools ===\n*Ozuh primary school, Ozuh-Omuma\n*Abia Central School, Abia-Omuma\n*Community Primary School, Amaodum Etiti-Omuma\n*Umuhu Primary School, Umuhu-Omuma\n*Powerline Primary School, Abia-Omuma\n*Omuma Central School, Omuma\n\n== Economy ==\nOmuma sits in the rain forest and produces many agricultural products, such as yams, cassava, taro, ona, corn, rubber, and palm. Omuma also has crude oil and natural gas reserves, like most of the Igbo regions. Omuma is also noted for its entrepreneurial skills. Notable industries in Omuma include bread factories, bottled water companies, sawmills, and [[palm oil]] mills.
