Ponni (Radha) used to hear him singing at the temple and falls in love with him. However, Ponni's mother Vadivukarasai wanted her to marry Radharavi, her relation who had come from  Singapore. Ponni is not willing to marry Radharavi.\n\nPonni performs all of Sakthi's chores without his knowledge. As Sakthi is blind, he is unable to see Ponni, but he can hear Ponni's anklets (an ornament which bharathanatiyam dancers wore on their legs). Once when Sakthi makes a floral offering to the Ambal, they fall on Ponni. From that incident Ponni  thinks that Sakthi is her spouse and breaks to him the news and Sakthi responds positively to the suggestion.\n\nDue to illness, Ponni does not meet Sakthi for three days. When Sakthi comes to know that she is ill, he goes to her house to see her. Her mother discreetly enquires about Sakthi. Ponni says that he is an astrologer and that he is blind. Ponni's  mother informs her worker to give him food as he looked like a beggar. After she leaves, Ponni apologizes to Sakthi for her mother's behaviour and when both talk, Nayanam (Goundamani) hears it and informs Radharavi. Immediately, Radharavi's family goes to Ponni's home for fixing the marriage. But in the engagement, Ponni says that she doesn't like him.\n\nAfter getting frustrated with Ponni's decision, Radharavi's men put Sakthi inside a haystack and set fire to it. Ponni finds him and rescues him, and later they elope together. Both are starving and Ponni wants Sakthi to sing songs for money for their living. While considering Ponni's acclaim, she was kidnapped by some people who smoke marijuana. They tied the hands and legs of Ponni. Meanwhile, Nayanam finds her and takes her back to her home. She gets married to Janagaraj who is a Chettiyar and Dharamakatha (a person managing temple activities) for a famous temple.\n\nSakthi was adopted by a famous singer who arranges eye operation for him and he gets back his vision. He became a famous singer and Janagaraj arranges a temple function and invite Sakthi to sing in that function. Sakthi always thinks of Ponni and searches for her in all the functions where he sang. Sakthi went to Janagaraj's home to stay. Ponni is so stunned after seeing him that she drops his Aarthi plate.\n\nSakthi was too much depressed after Ponni left him. Hearing the love story of Sakthi and Ponni, Janagaraj felt very sad for Sakthi and wants to join him with his lover,  without knowing the real truth that his wife is the lover of Sakthi. Ponni too couldn't say to Sakthi that she is Ponni and she is married. Ponni comes to know that this is the last song Sakthi sings as he won't sing any more songs.\n\nSakthi sings his last song, during the end of the song Ponni wakes up from her seat and walks towards Sakthi in the function. From her salangi sound, Sakthi finds out that she is Ponni. Heavy rain breaks down and all the people run away. But Sakthi continues to sing for which Ponni dance in rain. Ponni knowingly hits pillars of the temples while dancing and dies. After seeing her die, Sakthi touches the Salangai of Ponni, praises it and dies at her feet.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music for the film was composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raaga.com/channels/tamil/moviedetail.asp?mid=T0000072|title=Kadhal Oviyam Songs|accessdate=2013-10-08|publisher=raaga}}</ref> Velli chalangaigal song is in chandrakauns raaga, Naadham En song is set to raaga Abheri.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/of-love-and-longing/article5329771.ece</ref><ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/a-ragas-journey-aspects-of-abheri/article2325286.ece</ref> The song \"Sangeetha Jaathi\" is based on Revathi, Poojaikkaaga vaazhum in Malayamaarudham, Poovil vandu koodum in Mohanam and \"Amma Azhage\" in Malahari raga.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/mystical-revathi/article4418462.ece</ref>\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''No.''' || '''Song''' || '''Singers''' ||'''Lyrics'''\n|-\n| 1 || \"Amma Azhage\" || [[S.

It is part of the [[Arkansas Delta]], lowlands along the river that have been historically important as an area for large-scale cotton cultivation.\n\nLandmarks around the county include [[Lake Chicot]], North America's largest [[oxbow lake]] and Arkansas's largest natural lake; the site of [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s first night-time flight; and the legendary burial site of [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando De Soto]], near Lake Village.\n\n==History==\nSpanish explorer Hernando de Soto came to this area with his expedition in 1542, settling for a time in the village or territory known as ''[[Guachoya]]''. The European-American town of Lake Village later developed in the 19th century at Lake Chicot, formed by an oxbow of the Mississippi River. Eighteenth-century French colonists named it ''Chicot'' because of the many cypress trees in the waterways. The word is translated to \"stumpy, or knobby\".\n\nThe area along the Mississippi River and major tributaries was developed as cotton plantations, the major commodity crop before and after the [[American Civil War]] of 1861\u20131865. Enslaved African Americans formed the labor force, comprising a majority of the population in the antebellum years. Major [[Plantations in the American South|large cotton plantations]] included [[Sunnyside Plantation|Sunnyside]] (owned in the 20th century by [[LeRoy Percy]], planter and US Senator from [[Greenville, Mississippi]]); Florence, Patria, Pastoria, Luna, and [[Lakeport Plantation|Lakeport]].<ref name=\"gatewood\">{{cite journal |last=Gatewood |first=Willard B, Jr. |title=Sunnyside: The Evolution of an Arkansas Plantation, 1840-1945 |journal=The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=5\u201329 |jstor=40022326 | date = Spring 1991   }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Union and Confederate forces fought at the [[Battle of Old River Lake]] from June 5 to June 6, 1864.\n\nThe population of the rural county has declined since its peak in 1940. Earlier in the century, boll weevils threatened the cotton crop, and many African Americans left in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] for opportunity in northern and midwestern industrial cities.

It is part of the [[Arkansas Delta]], lowlands along the river that have been historically important as an area for large-scale cotton cultivation.\n\nLandmarks around the county include [[Lake Chicot]], North America's largest [[oxbow lake]] and Arkansas's largest natural lake; the site of [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s first night-time flight; and the legendary burial site of [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando De Soto]], near Lake Village.\n\n==History==\nSpanish explorer Hernando de Soto came to this area with his expedition in 1542, settling for a time in the village or territory known as ''[[Guachoya]]''. The European-American town of Lake Village later developed in the 19th century at Lake Chicot, formed by an oxbow of the Mississippi River. Eighteenth-century French colonists named it ''Chicot'' because of the many cypress trees in the waterways. The word is translated to \"stumpy, or knobby\".\n\nThe area along the Mississippi River and major tributaries was developed as cotton plantations, the major commodity crop before and after the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865. Enslaved African Americans formed the labor force, comprising a majority of the population in the antebellum years. Major [[Plantations in the American South|large cotton plantations]] included [[Sunnyside Plantation|Sunnyside]] (owned in the 20th century by [[LeRoy Percy]], planter and US Senator from [[Greenville, Mississippi]]); Florence, Patria, Pastoria, Luna, and [[Lakeport Plantation|Lakeport]].<ref name=\"gatewood\">{{cite journal |last=Gatewood |first=Willard B, Jr. |title=Sunnyside: The Evolution of an Arkansas Plantation, 1840-1945 |journal=The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=5\u201329 |jstor=40022326 | date = Spring 1991   }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Union and Confederate forces fought at the [[Battle of Old River Lake]] from June 5 to June 6, 1864.\n\nThe population of the rural county has declined since its peak in 1940. Earlier in the century, boll weevils threatened the cotton crop, and many African Americans left in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] for opportunity in northern and midwestern industrial cities. In addition, mechanization of agriculture and consolidation into industrial-style farms has reduced the need for farm labor.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|691|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|644|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|47|sqmi}} (6.7%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_05.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 25, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Image:US 65.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 65]]\n*[[Image:US 82.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 82]]\n*[[Image:US 165.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Highway 165]]\n*[[Image:US 278.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Highway 278]]\n*[[Image:Arkansas 8.svg|20px]] [[Arkansas Highway 8|Highway 8]]\n*[[Image:Arkansas 35.svg|20px]] [[Arkansas Highway 35|Highway 35]]\n*[[Image:Arkansas 159.svg|25px]] [[Arkansas Highway 159|Highway 159]]\n*[[Image:Arkansas 52.svg|25px]] [[Arkansas Highway 52|Highway 52]]\n{{div col end}}\nArkansas 144\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Desha County, Arkansas|Desha County]] (north)\n* [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar County]], [[Mississippi]] (northeast)\n* [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington County]], [[Mississippi]] (east)\n* [[Issaquena County, Mississippi|Issaquena County]], [[Mississippi]] (southeast)\n* [[East Carroll Parish, Louisiana|East Carroll Parish]], [[Louisiana]] (south)\n* [[West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|West Carroll Parish]], [[Louisiana]] (south)\n* [[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse Parish]], [[Louisiana]] (southwest)\n* [[Ashley County, Arkansas|Ashley County]] (west)\n* [[Drew County, Arkansas|Drew County]] (northwest)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1830= 1165\n|1840= 3806\n|1850= 5115\n|1860= 9234\n|1870= 7214\n|1880= 10117\n|1890= 11419\n|1900= 14528\n|1910= 21987\n|1920= 21749\n|1930= 22646\n|1940= 27452\n|1950= 22306\n|1960= 18990\n|1970= 18164\n|1980= 17793\n|1990= 15713\n|2000= 14117\n|2010= 11800\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10438\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 25, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ar190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|editor-last=Forstall|editor-first=Richard L.|date=March 27, 1995|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Trotter's achievements in target rifle shooting make him one Guernsey's most decorated sportsmen. Best remembered for his prowess in fullbore rifle shooting, Trotter won [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|H.M. The Queen's Prize]] in 1975, and is a [[Commonwealth Games]] medallist, winning a bronze medal in [[1982 Commonwealth Games|1982]] while representing Guernsey. Also a champion smallbore shooter, Trotter represented Kenya in two [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].\n\nBorn in [[Edinburgh]], Trotter was educated at [[Elizabeth College, Guernsey]], where he captained the school shooting team. He later served during [[World War II]] with the [[Royal Engineers]] before commanding a group of German [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of War]] in [[Egypt]] after the war. After studying photography, Trotter established a photographic business in [[Nairobi]] from 1951 to 1962. He achieved considerable success as a commercial photographer, and his work is now regarded as a rich resource for the study of Kenya immediately prior to [[History of Kenya#Independence|its independence in 1962]]. During this time, Trotter represented Kenya at [[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne 1956]] and [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome 1960]].\n\nTrotter returned to Britain in the early 1960s. In 1965, a head-on car collision caused injuries which impaired his mobility. Trotter returned to Guernsey in 1966, taking ownership of a local gun shop. He won H.M. The Queen's Prize in 1975, becoming only the second winner of the event from the island, and represented Guernsey in three consecutive Commonwealth Games from 1974, winning a bronze medal in the Fullbore Rifle individual event at [[1982 Commonwealth Games|Brisbane 1982]].

That year, Trotter was evacuated along with fellow students and staff to [[Great Hucklow]], [[Derbyshire]] during the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands]].

In 1949, he undertook a photography course at the [[London College of Communication|London School of Photo Engraving and Lithography]], obtaining a first-class pass in his exams. Trotter then established a photographic business in [[Nairobi]], Kenya from 1951 to 1962. He achieved considerable success as a photographer, and his work spanned a broad range of material, including weddings, natural history and news items. He also undertook commercial commissions showing industries of the time, and public occasions such as sporting and cultural events and royal visits. Trotter also produced films, including a nature film about baboons which won a [[Blue Ribbon Awards|Blue Ribbon Award]] for photography. During this time, Trotter represented Kenya in the Men's Smallbore Rifle events (Prone and Three Positions) at two [[Olympic Games]]\u2013[[1956 Summer Olympics|Melbourne 1956]] and [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome 1960]]\u2013and the World Championships in 1962.<ref name=\"NRA obituary\"/>\n\nHe returned to London in the early 1960s, before moving to [[Fleet, Hampshire]] where he joined the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]] and later [[Aberporth]], Wales as a photographer.

With the special blue background badge on his blazer and the coveted gold medal in his pocket, he stood on the after-deck of the mailboat waving his white hat to the big crowd who had gathered to welcome him back. The first to greet him when he came ashore were his father and his wife, Joan. Theirs were only the first of a torrent of congratulations to be showered upon him. The occasion belonged not only to Charles Trotter but also the Guernsey Rifle Club. Members had turned out in force. Among them was Captain Don Bisset, who remembers the only other Guernsey winner of the Queen's Prize, Private William Priaulx, whose success was in 1899. A garland of red and orange flowers was placed around the new winner's neck before he was chaired in traditional Bisley style round the New Jetty in a procession led by the Salvation Army Band ...

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, commented that in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref>\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer''' || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist''' \n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the writers is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham commented 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> \n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

Bidwell's store, adobe, and mill are visible looking northwest from near modern-day First and Main streets.]]\n\n{{main|Chico, California}}\n{{California history sidebar}}\nThe '''history of Chico, California''', begins with the original inhabitants, the [[Mechoopda]] [[Maidu]].\n\nThe [[Chico, California|city of Chico]] was founded in 1860 by General [[John Bidwell]], a member of one of the first [[wagon train]]s to reach [[California]] in 1841. The city became [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] January 8, 1872.\n\nHistorian [[W.H. \"Old Hutch\" Hutchinson]] identified five events as the most seminal in Chico history. They were \n# the arrival of [[John Bidwell]] in 1850\n# the arrival of the [[California and Oregon Railroad]] in 1870\n# the establishment of the [[California State University, Chico|Northern Branch of the State Normal School]] in 1887\n# the purchase of the [[Sierra Lumber Company]] by the [[Diamond Match Company]] in 1900\n# the development of the Army Air Base which is now the [[Chico Municipal Airport]].<ref name=\"ca20thcph\">Chico: A 20th Century Pictoral History (1995)</ref>\n\nSince then, several seminal events have unfolded in Chico. These include: the construction and relocation of [[California State Highway 99|Highway 99E]] through town in the early sixties; [[Playboy Magazine]] naming [[California State University, Chico|Chico State]] the number one [[party school]] in the nation in 1987; and the establishment of a Green Line on the western [[city limits]] as protection of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] lands.\n\n==19th century==\nChico was founded by General [[John Bidwell]], a member of one of the first wagon trains to reach California in 1843. Bidwell first came to the area in that same year as an employee of [[John Sutter]]. In 1844, William Dickey was granted [[Rancho Arroyo Chico]] by Mexican Governor [[Manuel Micheltorena]]. In two separate purchases in 1849 and 1851, Bidwell acquired the Rancho Arroyo Chico. He filed a claim for the land with the [[Public Land Commission]] in 1852, and the claim was confirmed the next year. After a subsequent legal challenge, the claim was confirmed by the [[US District Court]] for the Northern District in 1855, and eventually by the [[US Supreme Court]]. The title patent was signed by President [[James Buchanan]] in 1860.\n\nA treaty of \"peace and friendship\" was signed on September 18, 1853, between the [[Mechoopda]], and other tribes of the area near Bidwell's Ranch; Indians at Reading's Ranch at [[Colusa, California|Colusa]]; and tribes along the [[Cosumnes River|Consumnes]] and [[Yuba River|Yuba]] rivers. United States Indian Agent [[O. M. Wozencraft]] represented the U.S. government at Bidwell's Ranch.\n\nThe city of Chico was founded in 1860 by General [[John Bidwell]]. That year, Bidwell requested the county send a [[Surveying|surveyor]] to lay out the city [[grid plan|street grid]].\n\nChico was the starting point of the [[Koncow Trail of Tears]] also called the [[Nome Cult Trail]]. On August 28, 1863, all [[Konkow]] [[Maidu]] were to be at the [[Bidwell Mansion State Historical Park|Bidwell Ranch]] to be taken to the [[Round Valley Reservation]] at [[Covelo, California|Covelo]] in [[Mendocino County]]. Any [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] remaining in the area were to be shot. 435 Maidu were rounded up and marched under guard west out of the [[Sacramento Valley]] and through to the [[California Coast Ranges|Coastal Range]]. 461 Indians started the trek, 277 finished. They reached [[Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation|Round Valley]] on September 18, 1863.\n\nThe city became [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] January 8, 1872. In that year the first Chico Board of Trustees was established. This body was the predecessor of the modern Chico City Council. The first municipal election was February 5, 1872 with 217 votes cast. The first City Board of Trustees comprised G.W. Dorn, C.L. Pond, B.F. Allen, W.K. Springer, and John Kempf. Dorn was named as the first President of the Board of Trustees. Municipal elections were annual and the term for a trustee was two years. However, the first trustees had to draw lots to determine who would serve for a one-, two- or three-year term. This was to provide that there would only be either two or three seats up for election in any given year henceforth.\n\nThe Butte Flume and Lumber Company built a [[Log flume|flume]] from [[Butte Meadows, California|Butte Meadows]] down [[Big Chico Creek]] in 1872, completing it in 1874. This flume would supply the [[Diamond Match Company]] with lumber for its operations.\n\nIn 1877, anti-Chinese riots erupted.\n\nIn 1887, the California legislature established the Northern Branch of the State Normal School of California. Chico was chosen as its site, and Bidwell donated land from his cherry orchard for this purpose. This school would come to be called the Chico Normal School, Chico State College, and finally [[California State University, Chico]].\n\nChico was the northern terminus of the [[Sacramento Northern Railroad]], an [[Railway electrification system|electrified railway]] which extended south to [[Sacramento]] and [[Oakland]] in the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area.\n\nOriginally the City Board of Trustees was elected [[at-large]], with each trustee standing for election by the entire [[constituency|electorate]] of the city, rather than just by a [[district]]. On April 12, 1897, the city had its first election under the [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] system. The [[polling place]]s for each ward were: First Ward - City Hall, Second Ward - Bruce and Young Building, Third Ward - Western Hose House, and Fourth Ward - Chico Hotel at the Junction.\n\nBeginning in 1899, municipal elections would be only held every two years.\n\nIn 1899, Mayor J. Ellis Rodley, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of perjury in the witnessing of a forged will offered for probate. He was granted parole in 1906.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/251508837 \"Rodley Released From State Prison,\" ''San Francisco Chronicle,'' February 11, 1906, page 37] <code><nowiki>Library card required</nowiki></code></ref>\n\n==20th century==\nOn July 10, 1905, [[Annie Bidwell]] signed a [[grant deed]] donating {{convert|1902.88|acre|km2}} to the people of Chico for a public park. These initial acres were expanded upon several times over the years, resulting in the creation of [[Bidwell Park]], one of the largest [[municipal park]]s in the nation.\n\nIn 1907, municipal elections were changed so that one trustee would be elected from each ward to serve concurrent four-year terms.\n\nIn 1917 the first [[parade]] that would later come to be called the [[Pioneer Days (Chico, California)|Pioneer Day]] Parade was held on the downtown streets as a celebration of Senior Day. This tradition would continue as a celebration of local heritage under various names on the first Saturday in May each year until 1990.<ref>[http://www.taugammatheta.com/historyofpweek.htm History of Pioneer Week & Pioneer Days at Chico State CA California<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a \"Board of Freeholders\" charged with framing a [[Municipal charter|City Charter]].\n\nIn 1923, under the new Charter, the Board of Trustees was replaced by the City Council. The ward system was also abolished and at-large election of city leaders was reinstated.\n\nIn 1933, there was a municipal election which included a recall attempt on three councilmembers. The recall was defeated.\n\nDuring [[World War II|WWII]] the [[Chico Municipal Airport|Chico Army Air Field]] was used to train fighter and bomber pilots. It was also home of the [[555th Parachute Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn December 6\u20137, 1958, [[Operation Chico]] evacuated 1000 people from [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] to Chico for the weekend as a [[civil defense]] exercise.\n\nIn the late fifties and early sixties, the city wrestled with the controversial issue of creating a bypass for [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] through [[Bidwell Park]]. The viaduct was built 1963\u201365.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.friendsofbidwellpark.org/lydonhistory.html |title=A Brief History Of Bidwell Park - Friends of Bidwell Park<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611214454/http://www.friendsofbidwellpark.org/lydonhistory.html |archive-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1961, the [[Municipal charter|City Charter]] was amended to increase the size of the Chico City Council from five to seven members.\n\nOn July 31, 1961, the first-ever [[aircraft hijacking]] on United States soil occurred at the [[Chico Municipal Airport]]. Two men were critically wounded and the hijacker was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.<ref>Chico: A 20th Century Pictoral History</ref>\n\nOn May 24, 1962, two explosions destroyed a [[Titan I]] missile at the [[456th Bombardment Wing|851st Strategic Missile Squadron]] complex located north of the [[Chico Municipal Airport]] between Keefer Road and Cohasset Road. An oxygen valve had stuck open and a blocked vent caused the gas to build up until a spark ignited it. However, the potentially catastrophic event was overshadowed in the national news by the launch of [[Scott Carpenter]] into space.<ref>[http://chicobeat.com/?q=ground_zero Chico Beat:Ground Zero]</ref> On June 6, trouble again struck as a flash fire in another silo killed a worker.\n\nOn April 22, 1970, students celebrating the first [[Earth Day]] on the [[Chico State]] campus pushed a car into West First Street (which was then [[California State Route 32|State Route 32]]) blocking traffic. The street was closed temporarily for safety. The incident escalated into a demonstration that lasted into the night. The protesters were arrested on conspiracy charges which were later dropped. The street re-opened the next day, however it was permanently closed over the segment running through campus later that year.\n\nOn July 21, 1982, the Butte County Board of Supervisors approved an amendment to the 1979 Butte County Land Use Element of the Butte County General Plan with the purpose of preserving agricultural land. This amendment established a \"Green Line\" on the west side of Chico beyond which urban development would be restricted. This line is responsible for the continued existence of working orchards relatively close to the core of the growing city.\n\nIn 1987 [[Playboy Magazine]] named [[California State University, Chico|Chico State]] the\n\"Number One [[party school|Party School]]\" in the nation. University President [[Robin Wilson (author)|Robin Wilson]] met with city officials including [[City Manager]] Fred Davis, and [[Police Chief]], John Bullerjahn with the goal of ending the reputation by ending the parties with police force. On April 25, 1987, [[police riot]]s broke out during the [[Pioneer Days (Chico, California)|Pioneer Days]] celebration. President Wilson announced an end to the 70-year-old tradition saying, he took Pioneer Days \"out back and shot it in the head.\" The tradition was revived in 1996 and has continued to this day.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pioneerdayparade.com/history.php |title=Pioneer Day Parade - 100 Years of Bidwell Park and the Community That Loves It:History, Environment, and Recreation<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809084550/http://www.pioneerdayparade.com/history.php |archive-date=2007-08-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.csuchico.edu/lspr/bits.htm University Archives - Bits and Pieces<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the [[Olympic Torch]] arrived in Chico at the [[Chico (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]]. The torch was carried through the closed streets with thousands of Chicoans celebrating along the path.\n\nIn 1996 the recently re-elected council member [[Ted Hubert]] died prior to being re-sworn in, and more significantly, before the selection of mayor had occurred. The evenly, and deeply divided council stalemated on the selection. This resulted in a rotating [[pro tempore|Mayor Pro Tempore]] system for about six months. The remaining six council members each took turns serving as meeting chair until they appointed\n[[Bill Johnston (Chico, California)|Bill Johnston]] to fill the council vacancy, and [[Rick Keene]] mayor.\n\nIn the years while the [[Pioneer Days (Chico, California)|Pioneer Days]] celebration was canceled (1990-1996), the [[Halloween]] and [[St. Patrick's Day]] celebrations grew into much larger events. These holidays had always enjoyed a high rate of participation in Chico due to its young population. However, following the loss of Pioneer Days, St. Patrick's Day and Halloween grew in popularity to compensate. [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|Mutual aid]] was invoked by police each year for several years{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} and a campaign launched by city government to combat the increase in alcohol-related arrests.\n\n==21st century==\nIn 2000 and 2001, the city closed downtown streets to accommodate the thousands of Halloween revelers.\nHowever, in 2002 the streets were no longer closed. The City even conducted a TV ad campaign telling people not to come downtown for Halloween. In response to the incidence of thrown bottles, and broken glass, the City Council has established a \"Glass Free Zone\" largely contiguous with the downtown and the [[South Campus Neighborhood]]. The Council activates the \"Glass Free Zone\" every Halloween and St. Patrick's Day and from time to time at the request of the police when they believe there will be a large gathering of revelers. Most recently, [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Day]] was added to the growing list of holidays requiring such a response.\n\nIn 1998, the tower supporting the famous Diamond on top of the [[Senator Theatre (Chico, California)|Senator Theatre]] at Fifth and Main was discovered to be leaning. It was determined to be at risk of collapse, and was removed. The tower was refurbished and put back in place in 2005.\n\nIn 2003, a branch from one of the majestic [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]] trees planted in 1873 by John Bidwell in City Plaza fell and hit a person sitting on a bench. The incident prompted the removal of the trees, some of which had rotting roots. The city embarked on a renovation of City Plaza in 2005, and in November 2006, the newly renovated Chico City Plaza was re-opened.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of mayors of Chico, California]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{LocalWiki|chico|History_of_Chico}}\n\n{{Chico, California}}\n{{California history}}\n\n[[Category:Histories of cities in California|Chico, California]]\n[[Category:Chico, California]]\n[[Category:History of Butte County, California]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Chico-ca-1856.jpg|thumb|300px|right|One of the earliest photographs of Chico.

These initial acres were expanded upon several times over the years, resulting in the creation of [[Bidwell Park]], one of the largest [[municipal park]]s in the nation.\n\nIn 1907, municipal elections were changed so that one trustee would be elected from each ward to serve concurrent four-year terms.\n\nIn 1917 the first [[parade]] that would later come to be called the [[Pioneer Days (Chico, California)|Pioneer Day]] Parade was held on the downtown streets as a celebration of Senior Day. This tradition would continue as a celebration of local heritage under various names on the first Saturday in May each year until 1990.<ref>[http://www.taugammatheta.com/historyofpweek.htm History of Pioneer Week & Pioneer Days at Chico State CA California<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn June 4, 1921, an election was held to choose a \"Board of Freeholders\" charged with framing a [[Municipal charter|City Charter]].\n\nIn 1923, under the new Charter, the Board of Trustees was replaced by the City Council. The ward system was also abolished and at-large election of city leaders was reinstated.\n\nIn 1933, there was a municipal election which included a recall attempt on three councilmembers. The recall was defeated.\n\nDuring [[World War II|WWII]] the [[Chico Municipal Airport|Chico Army Air Field]] was used to train fighter and bomber pilots. It was also home of the [[555th Parachute Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn December 6\u20137, 1958, [[Operation Chico]] evacuated 1000 people from [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] to Chico for the weekend as a [[civil defense]] exercise.\n\nIn the late fifties and early sixties, the city wrestled with the controversial issue of creating a bypass for [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] through [[Bidwell Park]]. The viaduct was built 1963-65.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.friendsofbidwellpark.org/lydonhistory.html |title=A Brief History Of Bidwell Park - Friends of Bidwell Park<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611214454/http://www.friendsofbidwellpark.org/lydonhistory.html |archive-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1961, the [[Municipal charter|City Charter]] was amended to increase the size of the Chico City Council from five to seven members.\n\nOn July 31, 1961, the first-ever [[aircraft hijacking]] on United States soil occurred at the [[Chico Municipal Airport]]. Two men were critically wounded and the hijacker was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.<ref>Chico: A 20th Century Pictoral History</ref>\n\nOn May 24, 1962, two explosions destroyed a [[Titan I]] missile at the [[456th Bombardment Wing|851st Strategic Missile Squadron]] complex located north of the [[Chico Municipal Airport]] between Keefer Road and Cohasset Road. An oxygen valve had stuck open and a blocked vent caused the gas to build up until a spark ignited it. However, the potentially catastrophic event was overshadowed in the national news by the launch of [[Scott Carpenter]] into space.<ref>[http://chicobeat.com/?q=ground_zero Chico Beat:Ground Zero]</ref> On June 6, trouble again struck as a flash fire in another silo killed a worker.\n\nOn April 22, 1970, students celebrating the first [[Earth Day]] on the [[Chico State]] campus pushed a car into West First Street (which was then [[California State Route 32|State Route 32]]) blocking traffic. The street was closed temporarily for safety. The incident escalated into a demonstration that lasted into the night. The protesters were arrested on conspiracy charges which were later dropped. The street re-opened the next day, however it was permanently closed over the segment running through campus later that year.\n\nOn July 21, 1982, the Butte County Board of Supervisors approved an amendment to the 1979 Butte County Land Use Element of the Butte County General Plan with the purpose of preserving agricultural land. This amendment established a \"Green Line\" on the west side of Chico beyond which urban development would be restricted. This line is responsible for the continued existence of working orchards relatively close to the core of the growing city.\n\nIn 1987 [[Playboy Magazine]] named [[California State University, Chico|Chico State]] the\n\"Number One [[party school|Party School]]\" in the nation. University President [[Robin Wilson (author)|Robin Wilson]] met with city officials including [[City Manager]] Fred Davis, and [[Police Chief]], John Bullerjahn with the goal of ending the reputation by ending the parties with police force. On April 25, 1987, [[police riot]]s broke out during the [[Pioneer Days (Chico, California)|Pioneer Days]] celebration. President Wilson announced an end to the 70-year-old tradition saying, he took Pioneer Days \"out back and shot it in the head.\" The tradition was revived in 1996 and has continued to this day.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pioneerdayparade.com/history.php |title=Pioneer Day Parade - 100 Years of Bidwell Park and the Community That Loves It:History, Environment, and Recreation<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809084550/http://www.pioneerdayparade.com/history.php |archive-date=2007-08-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.csuchico.edu/lspr/bits.htm University Archives - Bits and Pieces<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the [[Olympic Torch]] arrived in Chico at the [[Chico (Amtrak station)|Amtrak station]]. The torch was carried through the closed streets with thousands of Chicoans celebrating along the path.\n\nIn 1996 the recently re-elected council member [[Ted Hubert]] died prior to being re-sworn in, and more significantly, before the selection of mayor had occurred. The evenly, and deeply divided council stalemated on the selection. This resulted in a rotating [[pro tempore|Mayor Pro Tempore]] system for about six months. The remaining six council members each took turns serving as meeting chair until they appointed\n[[Bill Johnston (Chico, California)|Bill Johnston]] to fill the council vacancy, and [[Rick Keene]] mayor.\n\nIn the years while the [[Pioneer Days (Chico, California)|Pioneer Days]] celebration was canceled (1990-1996), the [[Halloween]] and [[St. Patrick's Day]] celebrations grew into much larger events. These holidays had always enjoyed a high rate of participation in Chico due to its young population. However, following the loss of Pioneer Days, St. Patrick's Day and Halloween grew in popularity to compensate. [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|Mutual aid]] was invoked by police each year for several years{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} and a campaign launched by city government to combat the increase in alcohol-related arrests.\n\n==21st century==\nIn 2000 and 2001, the city closed downtown streets to accommodate the thousands of Halloween revelers.\nHowever, in 2002 the streets were no longer closed. The City even conducted a TV ad campaign telling people not to come downtown for Halloween. In response to the incidence of thrown bottles, and broken glass, the City Council has established a \"Glass Free Zone\" largely contiguous with the downtown and the [[South Campus Neighborhood]]. The Council activates the \"Glass Free Zone\" every Halloween and St. Patrick's Day and from time to time at the request of the police when they believe there will be a large gathering of revelers. Most recently, [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Day]] was added to the growing list of holidays requiring such a response.\n\nIn 1998, the tower supporting the famous Diamond on top of the [[Senator Theatre (Chico, California)|Senator Theatre]] at Fifth and Main was discovered to be leaning. It was determined to be at risk of collapse, and was removed. The tower was refurbished and put back in place in 2005.\n\nIn 2003, a branch from one of the majestic [[Ulmus pumila|Siberian elm]] trees planted in 1873 by John Bidwell in City Plaza fell and hit a person sitting on a bench. The incident prompted the removal of the trees, some of which had rotting roots. The city embarked on a renovation of City Plaza in 2005, and in November 2006, the newly renovated Chico City Plaza was re-opened.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of mayors of Chico, California]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{LocalWiki|chico|History_of_Chico}}\n\n{{Chico, California}}\n{{California history}}\n\n[[Category:Histories of cities in California|Chico, California]]\n[[Category:Chico, California]]\n[[Category:History of Butte County, California]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e20th century:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1963-65 \u2192 1963\u201365", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chico,_California"}

It was in many ways an aluminum version of the mixed-construction [[Heinkel He 70]] ''Blitz'', strengthened for dive bombing.\n\nIt was a conventional [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever]] [[monoplane]] with an inverted [[gull wing]] of [[Elliptical wing|elliptical]] planform mounted midway up the [[fuselage]]. It was considerably more streamlined than the Junkers competitor, with retractable [[landing gear]] and an internal [[bomb bay]].\n\nAs designed it was limited to filling a role similar to an [[Ground-attack aircraft|attack bomber]] like the [[Henschel Hs 123]] rather than a true dive bomber like the Junkers Ju 87. It was limited to bombing from a shallow angle, more properly known as \"glide bombing\", with the second crew member acting as the bomb aimer.\n\n==Production and testing==\nIn trials, it was discovered that the maximum dive angle was only 50\u00b0.\nIn June 1936, [[Ernst Udet]] took the He 118 on a test flight but after commencing his first dive from about 13,000&nbsp;feet the [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] suddenly feathered, shearing the reduction gears, and the He 118 disintegrated, leaving Udet to parachute to safety. The Ju 87 repeatedly demonstrated dives at 90 degrees with no trouble, and so won the contract.\n\nHeinkel complained in his biography that Udet ignored instructions and flew the aircraft outside of its limits. He suggests that the failure doomed his design, in spite of being unable to dive vertically like the Stuka.\n\nOf the 15 He 118s built, two went to Japan where they were designated '''DXHe''', however the aircraft disintegrated during Japanese flight tests.

The following month the similarly powered, fixed [[conventional landing gear]]-fitted [[Heinkel He 178]] V1 would make the first flight powered entirely by a turbojet engine.<ref>Guttman, Robert, \"Heinkel's Jet Test-Bed,\" ''Aviation History'', March 2012, p. 15.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n* '''He 118''' : Dive bomber prototypes.\n* '''He 118A-1''' : Eight production aircraft, powered by a 634&nbsp;kW (850&nbsp;hp) [[DB 600]]C engine.\n* '''DXHe1''': Two He 118s supplied to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] for evaluation in 1938.\n\n==Operators==\n;{{JPN}}\n*[[Imperial Japanese Navy]]\n\n==Specifications (He 118 V3)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Die Deutsche Luftr\u00fcstung 1933\u20131945 Vol.2 \u2013 Flugzeugtypen Erla-Heinkel<ref name=Nowarra>{{cite book |last=Nowarra |first=Heinz J. |title=Die Deutsche Luftr\u00fcstung 1933\u20131945 Vol.2 \u2013 Flugzeugtypen Erla-Heinkel |year=1993 |publisher=Bernard & Graefe Verlag |location=Koblenz |isbn=3-7637-5464-4 |language=German |pages=214, 270-271}}</ref>, The warplanes of the Third Reich<ref name=Green>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=William |title=The warplanes of the Third Reich |date=1970 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0385057822 |pages= |edition=1st 1973 reprint |page=327}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=2\n|length m=11.8\n|length note=\n|span m=15\n|span note=\n|height m=3.1\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=37.7\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=2450\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=3775\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=[[Daimler-Benz DB 600C]]\n|eng1 type=V-12 inverted liquid-cooled piston engine\n|eng1 note={{cvt|880|PS|hp kW}}\n::::{{cvt|910|PS|hp kW}} for take-off\n\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=constant-speed propeller\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed kmh=394\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|6000|m|0}}\n|cruise speed kmh=335\n|cruise speed note=at {{cvt|4000|m|0}}<br/>\n*'''Landing speed:''' {{cvt|105|km/h|mph kn}}\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=1250\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling m=8500\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude={{cvt|4000|m|0}} in 13 minutes 12 seconds\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=<!--</br>\n*'''Take-off run:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n*'''Take-off run to {{cvt|15|m|0}}:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n*'''Landing run:''' {{cvt||m|0}}\n*'''Landing run from {{cvt|15|m|0}}:''' {{cvt||m|0}}-->\n<!--\n        Armament\n-->\n|guns=<br />\n** 2 \u00d7 fixed forward-firing [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser|7.9 mm]] [[MG 17 machine gun]]s\n** 1 \u00d7 flexible rearward-firing 7.92 mm (.323 in) [[MG 15 machine gun]]\n|bombs= 1x [[SC 500 bomb|SC 500]] or [[SC 250 bomb|SC 250]] bomb on underfuselge swinging crutch in an internal bomb bay.\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent|\n|related=\n* [[Junkers Ju 87]]\n* [[Yokosuka D4Y]]\n|similar aircraft=\n|lists=\n* [[List of military aircraft of Germany]]\n* [[List of military aircraft of Japan]]\n|see also=\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--==Further reading==-->\n<!--==External links==-->\n\n{{Heinkel aircraft}}\n{{RLM aircraft designations}}\n{{Japanese Navy Dive Bombers}}\n\n[[Category:Inverted gull-wing aircraft]]\n[[Category:1930s German bomber aircraft]]\n[[Category:Heinkel aircraft|He 118]]\n[[Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft]]\n", "name_user": "Davemck", "label": "safe", "comment": "rmv duplicate parm", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_118"}

It is located in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity and is the provincial center of [[Semberija]], a geographic region in the country's northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRELIMINARY RESULTS of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Bhas.ba|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Semberija]] is a flat region which is bound by the rivers [[Sava]], [[Drina River|Drina]] and the Majevica mountains. The entire Semberija area is typically an agricultural region which has fertile land and suitable weather conditions.\n\nSemberija has the most developed agricultural area in Republika Srpska. The focus of the production is on wheat and corns, vegetables, cabbage, paprika, tomato and water-melon. Also, cattle-breeding (fattening of cows and pigs) and growing fruits.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe earliest confirmed traces of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000\u20133000&nbsp;BC). Most of the traces from prehistoric periods were found in the villages Ostoji\u0107evo, Batkovi\u0107, Glavi\u010dice, Dvorovi, Koj\u010dinovac, Patkova\u010da and Trije\u0161nica. Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons emphatically confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures \u2013 Vu\u010dedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].\n\n===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of channel Bistrik, between the villages Batkovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107evo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Ora\u0161\u010di\u0107 remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site \u010celopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and where iron tools were manufactured. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina. Although the name Bijeljina was first mentioned in 1446, this name was in use only after 1918. During Austro-Hungarian period, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.\n[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|285x285px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I]] monument]]\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Zgrada Skup\u0161tine grada Bijeljine 1.jpg|thumb|283x283px|The assembly building of Bijeljina]]\nIn 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]], famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893\u201395.<ref>[http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm Bijeljina na Internetu - skolstvo], Oaza.rs; accessed 9 July 2015.{{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\nIn front of City Hall is a statue of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] between 1903 and 1918. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Usta\u0161a]] removed it. After [[World War II]], the communist government refused to return the monument. The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Bosnian War====\n{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\nIn September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1\u20132 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).\n\nThe village of [[Batkovi\u0107]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batkovi\u0107 POW camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo|title=Pre\u017eivjeli logora\u0161 iz Batkovi\u0107a: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u ku\u0107u i stavlja pu\u0161ku na \u010delo|publisher=Oslobo\u0111enje|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811|title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP|publisher=Sense Agency|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135&dq=Batkovi%C4%87+Detention+Camp&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0bMwVdqeNezfsAT7roGgCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Batkovi%C4%87%20Detention%20Camp&f=false|title=''The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes''|publisher=Google Books|year=2003|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> A \"State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population\" or \"Commission for the Exchange of Population\" was created and headed by Vojkan \u0110urkovi\u0107, a [[Major (military)|Major]] in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers.

It is located in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity and is the provincial center of [[Semberija]], a geographic region in the country's northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRELIMINARY RESULTS of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Bhas.ba|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Semberija]] is a flat region which is bound by the rivers [[Sava]], [[Drina River|Drina]] and the Majevica mountains. The entire Semberija area is typically an agricultural region which has fertile land and suitable weather conditions.\n\nSemberija has the most developed agricultural area in Republika Srpska. The focus of the production is on wheat and corns, vegetables, cabbage, paprika, tomato and water-melon. Also, cattle-breeding (fattening of cows and pigs) and growing fruits.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe earliest confirmed traces of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000\u20133000&nbsp;BC). Most of the traces from prehistoric periods were found in the villages Ostoji\u0107evo, Batkovi\u0107, Glavi\u010dice, Dvorovi, Koj\u010dinovac, Patkova\u010da and Trije\u0161nica. Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons emphatically confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures \u2013 Vu\u010dedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].\n\n===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of channel Bistrik, between the villages Batkovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107evo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Ora\u0161\u010di\u0107 remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site \u010celopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and where iron tools were manufactured. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina. Although the name Bijeljina was first mentioned in 1446, this name was in use only after 1918. During Austro-Hungarian period, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.\n[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I]] monument]]\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]], famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893\u201395.<ref>[http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm Bijeljina na Internetu - skolstvo], Oaza.rs; accessed 9 July 2015.{{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\nIn front of City Hall is a statue of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] between 1903 and 1918.

The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Bosnian War====\n{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\nIn September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1\u20132 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).\n\nThe village of [[Batkovi\u0107]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batkovi\u0107 POW camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo|title=Pre\u017eivjeli logora\u0161 iz Batkovi\u0107a: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u ku\u0107u i stavlja pu\u0161ku na \u010delo|publisher=Oslobo\u0111enje|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811|title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP|publisher=Sense Agency|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135&dq=Batkovi%C4%87+Detention+Camp&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0bMwVdqeNezfsAT7roGgCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Batkovi%C4%87%20Detention%20Camp&f=false|title=''The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes''|publisher=Google Books|year=2003|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> A \"State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population\" or \"Commission for the Exchange of Population\" was created and headed by Vojkan \u0110urkovi\u0107, a [[Major (military)|Major]] in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers.

In his old age, the son of [[Habib ibn al-Muhallab]] and reigning governor of the [[Muhallabids]] offered al-Farahidi a pension and requested that the latter tutor the former's son. Al-Farahidi declined, stating that he was wealthy though possessing no money, as true poverty lay not in a lack of money, but in the soul.<ref name=khal495>Ibn Khallikan, ''Deaths'', pg. 495.</ref> The governor reacted by rescinding the pension, an act to which al-Farahidi responded with the following lines of poetry:\n\n:\"He, Who formed me with a mouth, engaged to give me nourishment till such a time as He takes me to Himself. Thou hast refused me a trifling sum, but that refusal will not increase thy wealth.\"\n\nEmbarrassed, the governor then responded with an offer to renew the pension and double the rate, which al-Farahidi still greeted with a lukewarm reception.<ref name=khal495/> Al-Farahidi's apathy about material wealth was demonstrated in his habit of quoting [[Akhtal]]'s famous stanza: \"If thou wantest treasures, thou wilt find none equal to a virtuous conduct.\"<ref name=khal497/>\n\nAl-Farahidi distinguished himself via his philosophical views as well. He reasoned that a man's intelligence peaked at the age of forty - the age when the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] began his call - and began to diminish after sixty, the point at which Muhammad died. He also believed that a person was at their peak intelligence at the clearest part of dawn.<ref name=khal495/>\n\nIn regard to the field of grammar, al-Farahidi held the realist views common among early Arab linguists yet rare among both later and modern times. Rather than holding the rules of grammar as he and his students described them to be absolute rules, al-Farahidi saw the Arabic language as the natural, instinctual speaking habits of the [[Bedouin]]; if the descriptions of scholars such as himself differed from how the Arabs of the desert naturally spoke, then the cause was a lack of knowledge on the scholar's part as the unspoken, unwritten natural speech of pure Arabs was the final determiner.<ref>Yasir Suleiman, \"Ideology, grammar-making and standardization.\" Taken from ''In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arabic Culture'', pgs. 13-14.

As also noted above, he unfortunately failed to produce a coherent, integrated theory which satisfies the requirements of generality, adequacy, and simplicity; instead, he merely listed and categorized the primary data, thus producing a meticulously detailed but incredibly complex formulation which very few indeed are able to master and utilize.\n\nDr. Zaki N.

In his old age, the son of [[Habib ibn al-Muhallab]] and reigning governor of the [[Muhallabids]] offered al-Farahidi a pension and requested that the latter tutor the former's son. Al-Farahidi declined, stating that he was wealthy though possessing no money, as true poverty lay not in a lack of money, but in the soul.<ref name=khal495>Ibn Khallikan, ''Deaths'', pg. 495.</ref> The governor reacted by rescinding the pension, an act to which al-Farahidi responded with the following lines of poetry:\n\n:\"He, Who formed me with a mouth, engaged to give me nourishment till such a time as He takes me to Himself. Thou hast refused me a trifling sum, but that refusal will not increase thy wealth.\"\n\nEmbarrassed, the governor then responded with an offer to renew the pension and double the rate, which al-Farahidi still greeted with a lukewarm reception.<ref name=khal495/> Al-Farahidi's apathy about material wealth was demonstrated in his habit of quoting [[Akhtal]]'s famous stanza: \"If thou wantest treasures, thou wilt find none equal to a virtuous conduct.\"<ref name=khal497/>\n\nAl-Farahidi distinguished himself via his philosophical views as well. He reasoned that a man's intelligence peaked at the age of forty - the age when the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] began his call - and began to diminish after sixty, the point at which Muhammad died. He also believed that a person was at their peak intelligence at the clearest part of dawn.<ref name=khal495/>\n\nIn regard to the field of grammar, al-Farahidi held the realist views common among early Arab linguists yet rare among both later and modern times. Rather than holding the rules of grammar as he and his students described them to be absolute rules, al-Farahidi saw the Arabic language as the natural, instinctual speaking habits of the [[Bedouin]]; if the descriptions of scholars such as himself differed from how the Arabs of the desert naturally spoke, then the cause was a lack of knowledge on the scholar's part as the unspoken, unwritten natural speech of pure Arabs was the final determiner.<ref>Yasir Suleiman, \"Ideology, grammar-making and standardization.\" Taken from ''In the Shadow of Arabic: The Centrality of Language to Arabic Culture'', pgs. 13-14.

Nasr b. Sayyar, had dictated edited portions to al-Layth and they had reviewed its preparation together.  Al-Nadim writes that a manuscript in the possession of [[Da'laj]] had probably belonged originally to Ibn al-'Ala [[al-Sijistani]], who according to Durustuyah had been a member of a circle of scholars who critiqued the book.

''24'' is known for employing [[plot twists]] which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men \u2014 one of whom possesses crucial information \u2014 are dying in a room with only one surgeon.\n\n===Overview===\n{{Main|List of 24 episodes}}\n{{:List of 24 episodes}}\n\n[[24 (season 1)|Season 1]] begins at midnight on the day of the California presidential primary. [[Jack Bauer]]'s protocol is to protect Senator [[David Palmer (24 character)|David Palmer]] from an assassination plot and rescue his own family from those responsible, who seek retribution for Jack and Palmer's involvement with a covert American mission in the [[Balkans]].\n\n[[24 (season 2)|Season 2]], set 18 months later, begins at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack must stop a nuclear bomb from detonating in Los Angeles, then assist President David Palmer in proving who is responsible for the threat and avoid war between the U.S. and three Middle Eastern countries.\n\n[[24 (season 3)|Season 3]], set three years later, begins at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Jack must infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel to seize a deadly virus being marketed underground. President Palmer must deal with a potential scandal that could cost him his presidency.\n\n[[24 (season 4)|Season 4]], set 18 months later, begins at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack must save the lives of his new boss, Secretary of Defense [[James Heller (24 character)|James Heller]], and Heller's daughter [[Audrey Raines]] (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when they are kidnapped by terrorists. However, [[Habib Marwan]] uses this as a disguise to launch further attacks against America, and Jack is forced to use unorthodox methods to stop him, which results in long-term consequences for both Jack and the United States.\n\n[[24 (season 5)|Season 5]], set 18 months after, begins at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack is believed to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government. The acquisition of nerve gas by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.\n\n[[24 (season 6)|Season 6]], set 20 months later, begins at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack is released after being detained in a Chinese prison following the events of Season 5. Terrorists who hold a vendetta against Jack plot to set off [[suitcase nuke|suitcase nuclear devices]] in America.

In the image, it shows several different people, in different locations, depicted at the same time. This is used to show the viewer what different characters are doing at the same time]]\n\nAlthough not the first to do so, ''24'' embraced the concept of [[Real time (media)|real time]]. This idea started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing \"24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour\". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a \"race against the clock\".<ref name=\"genesis\"/> Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen.<ref name=\"Hanks&nbsp;\u2014 Jack Back\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/jacks-back-the-clock-ticks-for-24s-antihero-1027348.html|title=Jack's back: The clock ticks for 24's antihero|last=Hanks|first=Robert|publisher=Independent News & Media Limited|date=November 21, 2008|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}</ref> The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> In line with the depiction of events in real time, ''24'' does not use [[slow motion]] techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours.<ref name=\"Hanks&nbsp;\u2014 Jack Back\" /> As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.\n\nAnother idea was the use of [[Multi-dynamic image technique|split screens]], which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.<ref name=\"genesis\"/>\n\nA major concept used in the series was the idea of a running clock. This initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the [[in-universe]] time of the story.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard.

I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas\u2014you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer\u2014that would make me feel uncomfortable.\" On the topic of torture and [[Islamophobia]] within the series, Gordon said, \"I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about\u2014although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate\u2014was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray in order to make it feel thrilling\u2014and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying \"I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother\u2014and the son\u2014were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: \"They could be next door.\" The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series.

''24'' is known for employing [[plot twists]] which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men \u2014 one of whom possesses crucial information \u2014 are dying in a room with only one surgeon.\n\n===Overview===\n{{Main|List of 24 episodes}}\n{{:List of 24 episodes}}\n\n[[24 (season 1)|Season 1]] begins at midnight on the day of the California presidential primary. [[Jack Bauer]]'s protocol is to protect Senator [[David Palmer (24 character)|David Palmer]] from an assassination plot and rescue his own family from those responsible, who seek retribution for Jack and Palmer's involvement with a covert American mission in the [[Balkans]].\n\n[[24 (season 2)|Season 2]], set 18 months later, begins at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Jack must stop a nuclear bomb from detonating in Los Angeles, then assist President David Palmer in proving who is responsible for the threat and avoid war between the U.S. and three Middle Eastern countries.\n\n[[24 (season 3)|Season 3]], set three years later, begins at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Jack must infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel to seize a deadly virus being marketed underground.

Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours.<ref name=\"Hanks&nbsp;\u2014 Jack Back\" /> As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.\n\nAnother idea was the use of [[Multi-dynamic image technique|split screens]], which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.<ref name=\"genesis\"/>\n\nA major concept used in the series was the idea of a running clock. This initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the [[in-universe]] time of the story.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.<ref name=\"ontheset\">{{Cite episode |series=[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren]]|title=On the Set of 24|network=Fox News|airdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\nThe first six seasons of the show were mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California locations\u2014both real and fictional.<ref name=\"Ticonderoga\"/> Other locations, such as [[Washington, D.C.]], have also been featured, for parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons.

I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas\u2014you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer\u2014that would make me feel uncomfortable.\" On the topic of torture and [[Islamophobia]] within the series, Gordon said, \"I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about\u2014although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate\u2014was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray in order to make it feel thrilling\u2014and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying \"I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother\u2014and the son\u2014were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: \"They could be next door.\" The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be.
