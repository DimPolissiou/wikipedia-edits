Known for his distinctive [[drawl]] and [[everyman]] screen persona, Stewart had a film career that spanned over 55 years and 80 films. With the strong morality he portrayed both on and off the screen, Stewart epitomized the \"American ideal\" in twentieth-century United States. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked him third on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest American male actors]].<ref name=\"AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars |website=American Film Institute (Afi.com) |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBorn and raised in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], Stewart started acting while studying at [[Princeton University]]. After graduating in 1932, he began a career as a stage actor, appearing on Broadway and in summer stock productions. In 1935, he signed a film contract with  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). The studio did not see leading man material in Stewart, but after three years of supporting roles and being loaned out to other studios, he had his big breakthrough in [[Frank Capra]]'s ensemble comedy ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938). The following year, Stewart garnered his first of five [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] (Oscar) nomination for his portrayal of an idealized and virtuous man who becomes a senator in Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939). He won his only Academy Award for Best Actor for his work in the screwball comedy ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), which also starred [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nA licensed amateur pilot, Stewart enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] as soon as he could after the United States entered the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1941. Although still an MGM star, his only public and film appearances from 1941 to 1945 were scheduled by the Air Corps. After fighting in the European theater of war, he had attained the rank of colonel and had received several awards for his service. He remained in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|U.S. Air Force Reserve]] and was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1959. He retired in 1968, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|United States Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]].\n\nAfter the war, Stewart had difficulties in adapting to changing Hollywood and even thought about ending his acting career. He became a freelancer, and had his first postwar role as [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]] in Capra's ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946). Although it earned him an Oscar nomination, the film was not a big success at first. It has increased in popularity in the decades since its release, and is considered a Christmas classic and one of Stewart's most famous performances. In the 1950s, Stewart experienced a career revival by playing darker, more morally ambiguous characters in Westerns and thrillers. Some of his most important collaborations during this period were with directors [[Anthony Mann]], with whom he made eight films including ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950), ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], with whom he collaborated on ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958). ''Vertigo'' was ignored by critics at its time of release, but has since been reevaluated and recognized as an American cinematic masterpiece. His other films in the 1950s included the Broadway adaptation ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'' (1950) and the courtroom drama ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), both of which landed him Academy Award nominations. He was one of the most popular film stars of the decade, [[James Stewart filmography|with most of his films becoming box office successes]].\n\nStewart's later Westerns included ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962)  and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964), both directed by [[John Ford]]. He signed a lucrative multi-movie deal with [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] in 1962, and appeared in many popular family comedies during the decade. After a brief venture into television acting, Stewart semi-retired by the 1980s, although he remained a public figure due to the renewed interest in his films with Capra and Hitchcock and his appearances at President Reagan's White House.

He was natural and at ease in front of the camera, despite his shy off-screen personality.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|pp=4, 53}} In line with his natural and conversational acting style, Stewart's costars found him easy to work with as he was willing to improvise around any situation that arose while filming.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=272}} Later in his career, Stewart began to resent his reputation of having a \"natural\" acting technique. He asserted that there wasn't anything natural about standing on a sound stage in front of lights and cameras while acting out a scene.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=246}}\n\nStewart had established early in his career that he was proficient at communicating personality and character nuances through his performances alone.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=60}} He used an \"inside-out\" acting technique, preferring to represent the character without accents, makeup, and props.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=174}} Additionally, he tended to act with his body, not only with his voice and face; for example, in ''Harvey'', Stewart portrays the main character's age and loneliness by slightly hunching down.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=202}} He was also known for his pauses that had the ability to hold the audience's attention. Film critic [[Geoffrey O'Brien]] related that Stewart's \"stammering pauses\" created anxious space for the audience, leaving them in anticipation for the scene which Stewart took his time leading up to.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=212}}\n\nStewart himself claimed to dislike his earlier film performances, saying he was \"all hands and feet\", yet added that he \"didn't seem to know what to do with either\".{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=66}} He added that even though he did not always like his performances, he would not get discouraged. He said, \"But I always tried, and if the script wasn't too good, well, then, I just tried a little bit harder. I hope, though, not so hard that it shows.\"{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=259}} Former co-star Kim Novak stated of his acting style that for emotional scenes, he would access emotions deep inside of him and would take time to wind down after the scene ended. He could not turn it off immediately after the director yelled cut.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=211}}\n[[File:The Man from Laramie trailer audio clip.ogg|thumb|Sample from ''The Man From Laramie'' trailer (1955) showcasing Stewart's recognizable drawl]]\n[[File:Ziegfeld Girl - Lana Turner and Jimmy Stewart.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lana Turner]]\u00a0and Stewart in ''Ziegfield Girl'' (1941)]]\nStewart was particularly adept at performing vulnerable scenes with women. [[Jack Lemmon]] suggested that Stewart's talent for performing with women was that he was able to allow the audience to see the respect and gentility he felt toward the women through his eyes. He showed that his characters needed them as much as their characters needed him.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=493}} In connection to Stewart's screen persona with women, [[Peter Bradshaw]] said ''The Philadelphia Story'' is \"a film every school pupil should see\" due to Stewart's character's clear explanation of sexual consent after being accused of taking advantage of the main female character.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Peter |title=Porn in schools?

Ebert put this into contemporary perspective by asking, \"What would it feel like to see [Tom Hanks] in a bizarre and twisted light?\", explaining that it is jarring to see a beloved everyman persona such as Stewart in dark roles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Rear Window |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-rear-window-1954 |website=Rogerebert.com |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> Furthermore, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] explained that since audiences were primarily interested in Stewart's \"star persona\" and \"aura\" than his characters, \"this makes it more striking when Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock periodically explore the neurotic and obsessive aspects of Stewart's persona to play against his all-American innocence and earnestness.\"<ref name=\"movimiento\">{{cite web |last1=Rosenbaum |first1=Jonathan |title=En movimiento: How Do We Judge Actors? |url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2016/08/en-movimiento-how-do-we-judge-actors/ |website=Jonathan Rosenbaum |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Janet Leigh &amp; James Stewart The Naked Spur Still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Janet Leigh]] and Stewart in Anthony Mann's ''The Naked Spur'' (1953)]]\n\nFilm scholar [[John Belton]] argued that rather than playing characters in his films, Stewart often played his own screen persona. He had difficulty playing famous historical personages because his persona could not accommodate the historical character. Belton explained that \"James Stewart is more James Stewart than Glenn Miller in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' (1954) or Charles Lindbergh in ''The Spirit of St. Louis'' (1957).\"{{sfn|Belton|1994|p=92}} Moreover, Jonathan Rosenbaum continued that Stewart's \"pre-existing life-size persona\" in ''Winchester '73'' \"helped to shape and determine the impact of [his character] in [this film].\"<ref name=\"movimiento\" /> \nOn the other hand, Stewart has been described as a character actor who went through several distinct career phases.{{sfn|Lloyd|Fuller|Desser|1983|pp=418\u2013419}} According to film scholar Amy Lawrence, the main elements of Stewart's persona \"a propensity for physical and spiritual suffering, lingering fears of inadequacy,\" were established by Frank Capra in the 1930s and were enhanced through his later work with Hitchcock and Mann.{{sfn|Lawrence|1997|pp=41-42}} John Belton explained that \"James Stewart evolves from the naive, small-town, populist hero of Frank Capra's 1930s comedies to the bitter, anxiety-ridden, vengeance-obsessed cowboy in Anthony Mann's 1950s Westerns and the disturbed voyeur and sexual fetishist in Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s suspense thrillers.\"{{sfn|Belton|1994|p=106}} During his postwar career, Stewart avoided appearing in comedies, ''Harvey'' being the exception.

Known for his distinctive [[drawl]] and [[everyman]] screen persona, Stewart had a film career that spanned over 55 years and 80 films. With the strong morality he portrayed both on and off the screen, Stewart epitomized the \"American ideal\" in twentieth-century United States. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked him third on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest American male actors]].<ref name=\"AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Stars |website=American Film Institute (Afi.com) |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBorn and raised in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], Stewart started acting while studying at [[Princeton University]]. After graduating in 1932, he began a career as a stage actor, appearing on Broadway and in summer stock productions. In 1935, he signed a film contract with  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). The studio did not see leading man material in Stewart, but after three years of supporting roles and being loaned out to other studios, he had his big breakthrough in [[Frank Capra]]'s ensemble comedy ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1938). The following year, Stewart garnered his first of five [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] (Oscar) nomination for his portrayal of an idealized and virtuous man who becomes a senator in Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939). He won his only Academy Award for Best Actor for his work in the screwball comedy ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), which also starred [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Cary Grant]].\n\nA licensed amateur pilot, Stewart enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] as soon as he could after the United States entered the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1941. Although still an MGM star, his only public and film appearances from 1941 to 1945 were scheduled by the Air Corps. After fighting in the European theater of war, he had attained the rank of colonel and had received several awards for his service. He remained in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|U.S. Air Force Reserve]] and was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1959. He retired in 1968, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|United States Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]].\n\nAfter the war, Stewart had difficulties in adapting to changing Hollywood and even thought about ending his acting career. He became a freelancer, and had his first postwar role as [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]] in Capra's ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946). Although it earned him an Oscar nomination, the film was not a big success at first. It has increased in popularity in the decades since its release, and is considered a Christmas classic and one of Stewart's most famous performances. In the 1950s, Stewart experienced a career revival by playing darker, more morally ambiguous characters in Westerns and thrillers. Some of his most important collaborations during this period were with directors [[Anthony Mann]], with whom he made eight films including ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950), ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], with whom he collaborated on ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958). ''Vertigo'' was ignored by critics at its time of release, but has since been reevaluated and recognized as an American cinematic masterpiece. His other films in the 1950s included the Broadway adaptation ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'' (1950) and the courtroom drama ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), both of which landed him Academy Award nominations. He was one of the most popular film stars of the decade, [[James Stewart filmography|with most of his films becoming box office successes]].\n\nStewart's later Westerns included ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962)  and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964), both directed by [[John Ford]]. He signed a lucrative multi-movie deal with [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] in 1962, and appeared in many popular family comedies during the decade. After a brief venture into television acting, Stewart semi-retired by the 1980s, although he remained a public figure due to the renewed interest in his films with Capra and Hitchcock and his appearances at President Reagan's White House. He received many honorary awards, including an [[Academy Honorary Award]] and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], both in 1985.\n\nStewart remained unmarried until his 40s, and was dubbed \"The Great American Bachelor\" by the press.

He was natural and at ease in front of the camera, despite his shy off-screen personality.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|pp=4, 53}} In line with his natural and conversational acting style, Stewart's costars found him easy to work with as he was willing to improvise around any situation that arose while filming.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=272}} Later in his career, Stewart began to resent his reputation of having a \"natural\" acting technique. He asserted that there wasn't anything natural about standing on a sound stage in front of lights and cameras while acting out a scene.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=246}}\n\nStewart had established early in his career that he was proficient at communicating personality and character nuances through his performances alone.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=60}} He used an \"inside-out\" acting technique, preferring to represent the character without accents, makeup, and props.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=174}} Additionally, he tended to act with his body, not only with his voice and face; for example, in ''Harvey'', Stewart portrays the main character's age and loneliness by slightly hunching down.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=202}} He was also known for his pauses that had the ability to hold the audience's attention. Film critic [[Geoffrey O'Brien]] related that Stewart's \"stammering pauses\" created anxious space for the audience, leaving them in anticipation for the scene which Stewart took his time leading up to.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=212}}\n\nStewart himself claimed to dislike his earlier film performances, saying he was \"all hands and feet\", yet added that he \"didn't seem to know what to do with either\".{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=66}} He added that even though he did not always like his performances, he would not get discouraged. He said, \"But I always tried, and if the script wasn't too good, well, then, I just tried a little bit harder. I hope, though, not so hard that it shows.\"{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=259}} Former co-star Kim Novak stated of his acting style that for emotional scenes, he would access emotions deep inside of him and would take time to wind down after the scene ended. He could not turn it off immediately after the director yelled cut.{{sfn|Eyman|2017|p=211}}\n[[File:The Man from Laramie trailer audio clip.ogg|thumb|Sample from ''The Man From Laramie'' trailer (1955) showcasing Stewart's recognizable drawl]]\n[[File:Ziegfeld Girl - Lana Turner and Jimmy Stewart.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lana Turner]]\u00a0and Stewart in ''Ziegfield Girl'' (1941)]]\nStewart was particularly adept at performing vulnerable scenes with women. [[Jack Lemmon]] suggested that Stewart's talent for performing with women was that he was able to allow the audience to see the respect and gentility he felt toward the women through his eyes. He showed that his characters needed them as much as their characters needed him.{{sfn|Dewey|1996|p=493}} In connection to Stewart's screen persona with women, [[Peter Bradshaw]] said ''The Philadelphia Story'' is \"a film every school pupil should see\" due to Stewart's character's clear explanation of sexual consent after being accused of taking advantage of the main female character.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Peter |title=Porn in schools?

Ebert put this into contemporary perspective by asking, \"What would it feel like to see [Tom Hanks] in a bizarre and twisted light?\", explaining that it is jarring to see a beloved everyman persona such as Stewart in dark roles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Rear Window |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-rear-window-1954 |website=Rogerebert.com |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> Furthermore, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] explained that since audiences were primarily interested in Stewart's \"star persona\" and \"aura\" than his characters, \"this makes it more striking when Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock periodically explore the neurotic and obsessive aspects of Stewart's persona to play against his all-American innocence and earnestness.\"<ref name=\"movimiento\">{{cite web |last1=Rosenbaum |first1=Jonathan |title=En movimiento: How Do We Judge Actors? |url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2016/08/en-movimiento-how-do-we-judge-actors/ |website=Jonathan Rosenbaum |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Janet Leigh &amp; James Stewart The Naked Spur Still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Janet Leigh]] and Stewart in Anthony Mann's ''The Naked Spur'' (1953)]]\n\nFilm scholar [[John Belton]] argued that rather than playing characters in his films, Stewart often played his own screen persona. He had difficulty playing famous historical personages because his persona could not accommodate the historical character. Belton explained that \"James Stewart is more James Stewart than Glenn Miller in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' (1954) or Charles Lindbergh in ''The Spirit of St. Louis'' (1957).\"{{sfn|Belton|1994|p=92}} Moreover, Jonathan Rosenbaum continued that Stewart's \"pre-existing life-size persona\" in ''Winchester '73'' \"helped to shape and determine the impact of [his character] in [this film].\"<ref name=\"movimiento\" /> \nOn the other hand, Stewart has been described as a character actor who went through several distinct career phases.{{sfn|Lloyd|Fuller|Desser|1983|pp=418\u2013419}} According to film scholar Amy Lawrence, the main elements of Stewart's persona \"a propensity for physical and spiritual suffering, lingering fears of inadequacy,\" were established by Frank Capra in the 1930s and were enhanced through his later work with Hitchcock and Mann.{{sfn|Lawrence|1997|pp=41-42}} John Belton explained that \"James Stewart evolves from the naive, small-town, populist hero of Frank Capra's 1930s comedies to the bitter, anxiety-ridden, vengeance-obsessed cowboy in Anthony Mann's 1950s Westerns and the disturbed voyeur and sexual fetishist in Alfred Hitchcock's 1950s suspense thrillers.\"{{sfn|Belton|1994|p=106}} During his postwar career, Stewart avoided appearing in comedies, ''Harvey'' being the exception.

This reaction is important in the history of organic chemistry because it helped prove the structure of [[ether]]s.\n\nThe general reaction mechanism is as follows:<ref name = morrison>{{cite book|last1=Boyd|first1 = Robert Neilson|last2 = Morrison|first2 = Robert Thornton|title = Organic Chemistry|publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]|location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|edition = 6th|year = 1992|pages = 241\u2013242|isbn = 9780136436690}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Williamson-ether-synthesis-2D.png|400px|Williamson ether synthesis mechanism]]\n\nAn example is the reaction of [[sodium ethoxide]] with chloroethane to form [[diethyl ether]] and sodium chloride:\n\n:[Na]<sup>+</sup>[C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O]<sup>\u2212</sup> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl \u2192 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + [Na]<sup>+</sup>[Cl]<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe Williamson ether reaction follows an S<sub>N</sub>2 bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism. In an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction mechanism there is a backside attack of an electrophile by a nucleophile and it occurs in a concerted mechanism (happens all at once). In order for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to take place there must be a good leaving group which is strongly electronegative, commonly a halide.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wade|first=Leroy|title=Organic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|year=2017|isbn=9780321971371|location=|pages=261\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nIn the Williamson ether reaction there is an alkoxide ion (RO<sup>-</sup>) which acts as the nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon with the leaving group, which in most cases is an alkyl tosylate or an alkyl halide. The leaving site must be a primary carbon, because secondary and tertiary leaving sites generally prefer to proceed as an [[elimination reaction]]. Also, this reaction does not favor the formation of bulky ethers like di-tertbutyl ether, due to steric hindrance and predominant formation of alkenes instead.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wade|first=Leroy|title=Organic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|year=2017|isbn=9780321971371|location=|pages=682\u2013683}}</ref>[[File:Williamson ether synthesis of dipropyl ether.png|none|thumb|576x576px|An example for a Williamson ether synthesis to make dipropyl ether. X<sup>-</sup> product is not shown.]]\n\n==Scope==\nThe Williamson reaction is of broad scope, is widely used in both laboratory and industrial synthesis, and remains the simplest and most popular method of preparing ethers. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical ethers are easily prepared. The intramolecular reaction of [[halohydrin]]s in particular, gives [[epoxide]]s.\n\nIn the case of asymmetrical ethers there are two possibilities for the choice of reactants, and one is usually preferable either on the basis of availability or reactivity. The Williamson reaction is also frequently used to prepare an ether indirectly from two alcohols. One of the alcohols is first converted to a leaving group (usually [[tosylate]]), then the two are reacted together.\n\nThe alkoxide (or [[aryloxide]]) may be primary, secondary or tertiary. The alkylating agent, on the other hand is most preferably primary. Secondary alkylating agents also react, but tertiary ones are usually too prone to side reactions to be of practical use. The leaving group is most often a halide or a sulfonate ester synthesized for the purpose of the reaction. Since the conditions of the reaction are rather forcing, [[protecting group]]s are often used to pacify other parts of the reacting molecules (e.g. other [[alcohols]], [[amine]]s, etc.)\n\nThe Williamson ether synthesis is a common reaction in the field of Organic Chemistry in industrial synthesis and in undergraduate teaching laboratories. Yields for these ether syntheses are traditionally low when reaction times are shortened, which can be the case with undergraduate laboratory class periods. Without allowing the reactions to reflux for the correct amount of time (anywhere from 1-8 hours from 50 to 100 \u00b0C) the reaction may not proceed to completion generating a poor overall product yield. To help mitigate this issue microwave-enhanced technology is now being utilized to speed up the reaction times for reactions such as the Williamson ether synthesis. This technology has transformed reaction times that required reflux of at least 1.5 hours to a quick 10-minute microwave run at 130 \u00b0C and this has increased the yield of ether synthesized from a range of 6-29% to 20-55% (data was compiled from several different lab sections incorporating the technology in their syntheses).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baar|first=Marsha R.|last2=Falcone|first2=Danielle|last3=Gordon|first3=Christopher|date=2010|title=Microwave-Enhanced Organic Syntheses for the Undergraduate Laboratory: Diels\u2212Alder Cycloaddition, Wittig Reaction, and Williamson Ether Synthesis|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=87|issue=1|pages=84\u201386|doi=10.1021/ed800001x|bibcode=2010JChEd..87...84B}}</ref>\n\nThere have also been significant strides in the synthesis of ethers when using temperatures of 300 \u00b0C and up and using weaker alkylating agents to facilitate more efficient synthesis. This methodology helps streamline the synthesis process and makes synthesis on an industrial scale more feasible. The much higher temperature makes the weak alkylating agent more reactive and less likely to produce salts as a byproduct. This method has proved to be highly selective and especially helpful in production of aromatic ethers such as anisole which has increasing industrial applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fuhrmann|first=Edgar|last2=Talbiersky|first2=J\u00f6rg|date=2005|title=Synthesis of Alkyl Aryl Ethers by Catalytic Williamson Ether Synthesis with Weak Alkylation Agents|journal=Organic Process Research & Development|volume=9|issue=2|pages=206\u2013211|doi=10.1021/op050001h}}</ref>\n\n==Conditions==\nSince alkoxide ions are highly reactive, they are usually prepared immediately prior to the reaction, or are generated ''in situ''. In laboratory chemistry, ''in situ'' generation is most often accomplished by the use of a [[carbonate]] base or [[potassium hydroxide]], while in industrial syntheses [[phase transfer catalysis]] is very common. A wide range of solvents can be used, but protic solvents and apolar solvents tend to slow the reaction rate strongly, as a result of lowering the availability of the free nucleophile. For this reason, [[acetonitrile]] and [[N,N-dimethylformamide|''N'',''N''-dimethylformamide]] are particularly commonly used.\n\nA typical Williamson reaction is conducted at 50&nbsp;to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and is complete in 1&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;h. Often the complete disappearance of the starting material is difficult to achieve, and side reactions are common. Yields of 50\u201395% are generally achieved in laboratory syntheses, while near-quantitative conversion can be achieved in industrial procedures.\n\nCatalysis is not usually necessary in laboratory syntheses. However, if an unreactive [[alkylating agent]] is used (e.g. an alkyl chloride) then the rate of reaction can be greatly improved by the addition of a catalytic quantity of a soluble iodide salt (which undergoes halide exchange with the chloride to yield a much more reactive iodide, a variant of the [[Finkelstein reaction]]).

This reaction is important in the history of organic chemistry because it helped prove the structure of [[ether]]s.\n\nThe general reaction mechanism is as follows:<ref name = morrison>{{cite book|last1=Boyd|first1 = Robert Neilson|last2 = Morrison|first2 = Robert Thornton|title = Organic Chemistry|publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]|location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|edition = 6th|year = 1992|pages = 241\u2013242|isbn = 9780136436690}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Williamson-ether-synthesis-2D.png|400px|Williamson ether synthesis mechanism]]\n\nAn example is the reaction of [[sodium ethoxide]] with chloroethane to form [[diethyl ether]] and sodium chloride:\n\n:[Na]<sup>+</sup>[C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O]<sup>\u2212</sup> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl \u2192 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + [Na]<sup>+</sup>[Cl]<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n==Mechanism==\nThe Williamson ether reaction follows an S<sub>N</sub>2 bimolecular nucleophilic substitution mechanism. In an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction mechanism there is a backside attack of an electrophile by a nucleophile and it occurs in a concerted mechanism (happens all at once). In order for the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction to take place there must be a good leaving group which is strongly electronegative, commonly a halide.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wade|first=Leroy|title=Organic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|year=2017|isbn=9780321971371|location=|pages=261\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nIn the Williamson ether reaction there is an alkoxide ion (RO<sup>-</sup>) which acts as the nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon with the leaving group, which in most cases is an alkyl tosylate or an alkyl halide. The leaving site must be a primary carbon, because secondary and tertiary leaving sites generally prefer to proceed as an [[elimination reaction]]. Also, this reaction does not favor the formation of bulky ethers like di-tertbutyl ether, due to steric hindrance and predominant formation of alkenes instead.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wade|first=Leroy|title=Organic Chemistry|publisher=Pearson|year=2017|isbn=9780321971371|location=|pages=682\u2013683}}</ref>[[File:Williamson ether synthesis of dipropyl ether.png|none|thumb|576x576px|An example for a Williamson ether synthesis to make dipropyl ether. X<sup>-</sup> product is not shown.]]\n\n==Scope==\nThe Williamson reaction is of broad scope, is widely used in both laboratory and industrial synthesis, and remains the simplest and most popular method of preparing ethers. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical ethers are easily prepared. The intramolecular reaction of [[halohydrin]]s in particular, gives [[epoxide]]s.\n\nIn the case of asymmetrical ethers there are two possibilities for the choice of reactants, and one is usually preferable either on the basis of availability or reactivity. The Williamson reaction is also frequently used to prepare an ether indirectly from two alcohols. One of the alcohols is first converted to a leaving group (usually [[tosylate]]), then the two are reacted together.\n\nThe alkoxide (or [[aryloxide]]) may be primary, secondary or tertiary. The alkylating agent, on the other hand is most preferably primary. Secondary alkylating agents also react, but tertiary ones are usually too prone to side reactions to be of practical use. The leaving group is most often a halide or a sulfonate ester synthesized for the purpose of the reaction. Since the conditions of the reaction are rather forcing, [[protecting group]]s are often used to pacify other parts of the reacting molecules (e.g. other [[alcohols]], [[amine]]s, etc.)\n\nThe Williamson ether synthesis is a common reaction in the field of Organic Chemistry in industrial synthesis and in undergraduate teaching laboratories. Yields for these ether syntheses are traditionally low when reaction times are shortened, which can be the case with undergraduate laboratory class periods. Without allowing the reactions to reflux for the correct amount of time (anywhere from 1-8 hours from 50 to 100 \u00b0C) the reaction may not proceed to completion generating a poor overall product yield. To help mitigate this issue microwave-enhanced technology is now being utilized to speed up the reaction times for reactions such as the Williamson ether synthesis. This technology has transformed reaction times that required reflux of at least 1.5 hours to a quick 10-minute microwave run at 130 \u00b0C and this has increased the yield of ether synthesized from a range of 6-29% to 20-55% (data was compiled from several different lab sections incorporating the technology in their syntheses).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baar|first=Marsha R.|last2=Falcone|first2=Danielle|last3=Gordon|first3=Christopher|date=2010|title=Microwave-Enhanced Organic Syntheses for the Undergraduate Laboratory: Diels\u2212Alder Cycloaddition, Wittig Reaction, and Williamson Ether Synthesis|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=87|issue=1|pages=84\u201386|doi=10.1021/ed800001x|bibcode=2010JChEd..87...84B}}</ref>\n\nThere have also been significant strides in the synthesis of ethers when using temperatures of 300 \u00b0C and up and using weaker alklylating agents to facilitate more efficient synthesis. This methodology helps streamline the synthesis process and makes synthesis on an industrial scale more feasible. The much higher temperature makes the weak alkylating agent more reactive and less likely to produce salts as a byproduct. This method has proved to be highly selective and especially helpful in production of aromatic ethers such as anisole which has increasing industrial applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fuhrmann|first=Edgar|last2=Talbiersky|first2=J\u00f6rg|date=2005|title=Synthesis of Alkyl Aryl Ethers by Catalytic Williamson Ether Synthesis with Weak Alkylation Agents|journal=Organic Process Research & Development|volume=9|issue=2|pages=206\u2013211|doi=10.1021/op050001h}}</ref>\n\n==Conditions==\nSince alkoxide ions are highly reactive, they are usually prepared immediately prior to the reaction, or are generated ''in situ''. In laboratory chemistry, ''in situ'' generation is most often accomplished by the use of a [[carbonate]] base or [[potassium hydroxide]], while in industrial syntheses [[phase transfer catalysis]] is very common. A wide range of solvents can be used, but protic solvents and apolar solvents tend to slow the reaction rate strongly, as a result of lowering the availability of the free nucleophile. For this reason, [[acetonitrile]] and [[N,N-dimethylformamide|''N'',''N''-dimethylformamide]] are particularly commonly used.\n\nA typical Williamson reaction is conducted at 50&nbsp;to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and is complete in 1&nbsp;to 8&nbsp;h. Often the complete disappearance of the starting material is difficult to achieve, and side reactions are common. Yields of 50\u201395% are generally achieved in laboratory syntheses, while near-quantitative conversion can be achieved in industrial procedures.\n\nCatalysis is not usually necessary in laboratory syntheses. However, if an unreactive [[alkylating agent]] is used (e.g. an alkyl chloride) then the rate of reaction can be greatly improved by the addition of a catalytic quantity of a soluble iodide salt (which undergoes halide exchange with the chloride to yield a much more reactive iodide, a variant of the [[Finkelstein reaction]]). In extreme cases, silver compounds such as [[silver oxide]] may be added:<ref>{{OrgSynth|doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.060.0092|title = (''R'',''S'')-Mevalonolactone-2-<sup>13</sup>C (2''H''-Pyran-2-one-<sup>13</sup>C, tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-)|first1 = Masato|last1 = Tanabe|authorlink1 = Masato Tanabe|first2 = Richard H.|last2 = Peters|collvol = 7|collvolpages = 386|year = 1981|volume = 60|pages = 92|prep = CV7P0386}}</ref>\n:[[Image:WilliamsonEtherSynth.svg|Ether synthesis with silver oxide]]\n\nThe silver ion coordinates with the halide leaving group to make its departure more facile.

A [[Big Bad Wolf]] blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of [[straw]] and [[Branch|sticks]] respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of [[brick]]s. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older. The phrases used in the story, and the various [[moral]]s drawn from it, have become embedded in [[Western culture]].

The first little pig builds a house of [[straw]], but a wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house of [[Branch|sticks]], which the wolf also blows down, and the second little pig is also devoured. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely: \n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their brother's/sister's house, and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original, or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]). \n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List_of_Shrek_characters#Three_Little_Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List_of_Shrek_characters#The_Big_Bad_Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story.

A [[Big Bad Wolf]] blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of [[straw]] and [[Branch|sticks]] respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of [[brick]]s. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older. The phrases used in the story, and the various [[moral]]s drawn from it, have become embedded in [[Western culture]]. Many versions of ''The Three Little Pigs'' have been recreated or modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a kind character.

The first little pig builds a house of [[straw]], but a wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house of [[Branch|sticks]], which the wolf also blows down, and the second little pig is also devoured. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely: \n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their brother's/sister's house, and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original, or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]). \n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List_of_Shrek_characters#Three_Little_Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List_of_Shrek_characters#The_Big_Bad_Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story.
