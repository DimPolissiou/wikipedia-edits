Elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]] in November 1640, he voted for the execution of the [[Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford|Earl of Strafford]] in May 1641, and supported the removal of bishops from the [[Church of England]]. \n\nWhen the [[First English Civil War]] began in August 1642, he was one of the relatively few members of the Cornish gentry who backed [[Roundheads|Parliament]]. In March 1643, he was appointed commander of [[Drake's_Island|St Nicholas' Island]], a key defensive position for [[Plymouth]]. He was arrested in August, after attempting to switch sides, and taken to London.\n\nIn a demonstration of Parliament's commitment to winning the war, he was executed for treason in December 1644, followed in January by [[Sir_John_Hotham,_1st_Baronet|Sir John Hotham]], his son, and [[William_Laud|Archbishop Laud]]. His half-brother, [[John Carew (regicide)|John Carew]], was [[Hanging, drawing, and quartering|executed as a regicide]] in October 1660.  \n\n==Biography==\nAlexander Carew was the eldest surviving son of [[Sir Richard Carew, 1st Baronet]] (c. 1580-1643), and his first wife, Bridget Chudleigh (ca 1584-1612). In 1621, Sir Richard remarried, this time to Grace Rolle (1606-1655); their four sons included [[John Carew (regicide)|John Carew]], who signed the [[Regicide|death warrant]] for [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]], and was [[Hanging, drawing, and quartering|executed for treason]], in October 1660.{{sfn|Holford-Strevens|2004}}\n \nIn 1631, Alexander married Jane Rolle (1606-1673); they had two sons who lived to adulthood, [[Sir John Carew, 3rd Baronet|John]], 1635 to 1692, and Richard, 1641 to 1691.{{sfn|Cruikshank|2002}}  \n\n==Career==\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Trial of Strafford (State 2) cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Trial of the [[Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford|Earl of Strafford]], May 1641; Carew voted for his execution]]\nAlexander attended the [[Middle Temple]] in 1628, although there is no record of which university he went to. Although a [[Puritan]], his father was generally viewed as a moderate, more interested in education, inventions, and breeding cats; in August 1641, he purchased a [[Carew_baronets|baronetcy]], a method used by [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] to raise money for an army.{{sfn|Holford-Strevens|2004}} \n\nLike his father and [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|grandfather]], Carew was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|Cornwall]] in 1640. He supported the removal of bishops from the [[Church of England]], and voted for the execution of the [[Thomas_Wentworth,_1st_Earl_of_Strafford|Earl of Strafford]] in May 1641. He reportedly claimed \"If I were sure to be the next man, that should suffer upon the same scaffold, with the same axe, I would give my consent.\"{{sfn|Wright|2008}}   \n\nWhen the [[First English Civil War]] began in August 1642, as one of the relatively few members of the Cornish gentry who declared for [[Roundheads|Parliament]], he was appointed to numerous Parliamentary committees. After succeeding his father in March 1643, he was made a member of the [[Committee_for_Compounding_with_Delinquents|Cornish Sequestration Committee]], and commander of [[Drake's_Island|St Nicholas' Island]], a key defensive position for [[Plymouth]]. The summer of 1643 was the highpoint of Royalist success; by August, they controlled the entire [[West Country]], with the exception of Plymouth and [[Exeter]].{{sfn|Wright|2008}}\n\nAt this point, Carew began negotiations to switch sides; many others did the same, including his cousin [[James Chudleigh]], captured at [[Battle_of_Stratton|Stratton]] in May. Suggestions he was betrayed by a \"disloyal servant\" appear incorrect; in August, as a Parliamentary warship was entering harbour, Carew ordered his men to open fire. They refused, and he allegedly only escaped lynching when the ship's captain intervened; he was accused of treason, and held in the [[Tower of London]].{{sfn|Hopper|2012|p=97}}     \n[[File:Drakes island high.jpg|thumb|right|[[Drake's_Island|St Nicholas' Island, Plymouth]], now Drakes Island]]\nMany went to war in 1642 expecting a single, decisive battle; by 1643, it was clear this was incorrect, and Parliamentarians like Carew whose estates lay in occupied territory faced financial ruin. A series of Royalist victories caused a wave of defections; in September, he was one of five MPs expelled from Parliament, while [[Denzil_Holles,_1st_Baron_Holles|Denzil Holles]] was among those accused of seeking a negotiated settlement.{{sfn|Hopper|2012|p=48}}     \n\nAs the war grew more bitter, both sides began using martial law to prosecute senior officers who defected. In August 1644, Parliament established a military tribunal to try those suspected of treachery; in November, Carew was sentenced to death, along with the former commander of [[Kingston_upon_Hull|Hull]], [[Sir_John_Hotham,_1st_Baronet|Sir John Hotham]], and his son. These sentences were supported by those like [[Oliver Cromwell]], who felt the war risked being lost due to lack of commitment.{{sfn|Hopper|2012|p=184}}   \n\nHis wife petitioned Parliament, who dismissed her claim he was \"in a kind of distracted condition and unfit to die\", but gave him a month to arrange his affairs.

{"title_page": "Dominated convergence theorem", "text_new": "In [[measure theory]], [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]]'s '''dominated convergence theorem''' provides [[sufficient condition]]s under which [[almost everywhere]] [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of a [[sequence]] of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] implies convergence in the ''L''<sup>1</sup> norm. Its power and utility are two of the primary theoretical advantages of [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integration]] over [[Riemann integral|Riemann integration]].\n\nIn addition to its frequent appearance in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations, it is widely used in [[probability theory]], since it gives a sufficient condition for the convergence of [[expected value]]s of [[random variable]]s.\n\n==Statement of the theorem==\n'''Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem.''' Let (''f<sub>n</sub>'') be a sequence of [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[measurable function]]s on a [[measure space]] {{nowrap|(''S'', \u03a3, \u03bc)}}. Suppose that the sequence [[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]] to a function ''f'' and is dominated by some integrable function ''g'' in the sense that\n: <math>    |f_n(x)| \\le g(x)</math>\nfor all numbers ''n'' in the index set of the sequence and all points ''x'' \u2208 ''S''.\nThen ''f'' is integrable and\n: <math> \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_S |f_n-f|\\,d\\mu = 0</math>\nwhich also implies\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\int_S f_n\\,d\\mu = \\int_S f\\,d\\mu</math>\n\n'''Remark 1.''' The statement \"''g'' is integrable\" means that measurable function ''g'' is Lebesgue integrable; i.e.\n:<math>\\int_S|g|\\,d\\mu < \\infty.</math>\n\n'''Remark 2.''' The convergence of the sequence and domination by ''g'' can be relaxed to hold only {{nowrap|\u03bc-}}[[almost everywhere]] provided the measure space {{nowrap|(''S'', \u03a3, \u03bc)}} is [[measure (mathematics)#Completeness|complete]] or ''f'' is chosen as a measurable function which agrees {{nowrap|\u03bc-almost}} everywhere with the {{nowrap|\u03bc-almost}} everywhere existing pointwise limit. (These precautions are necessary, because otherwise there might exist a [[non-measurable set|non-measurable subset]] of a {{nowrap|\u03bc-null}} set {{nowrap|''N'' \u2208 \u03a3}}, hence ''f'' might not be measurable.)\n\n'''Remark 3.''' If \u03bc(''S'') < \u221e, the condition that there is a dominating integrable function ''g'' can be relaxed to [[uniformly integrable|uniform integrability]] of the sequence (''f<sub>n</sub>''), see [[Vitali convergence theorem]].\n\n==Proof of the theorem==\n[[Without loss of generality]], one can assume that ''f'' is real, because one can split ''f'' into its real and imaginary parts (remember that a sequence of complex numbers converges [[if and only if]] both its real and imaginary counterparts converge) and apply the [[triangle inequality]] at the end.\n\nLebesgue's dominated convergence theorem is a special case of the [[Fatou\u2013Lebesgue theorem]].

Neversoft was known for the ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game as well as the ''[[Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk's]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' video game franchises. The company was acquired by [[Activision]] in October 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/neversoft-entertainment/3010-1442/ |title=Neversoft Entertainment (Company) |publisher=[[Giant Bomb]] |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref> The studio was merged with [[Infinity Ward]] on May 3, 2014 and was made defunct on July 10, 2014.\n\n==History==\nNeversoft was founded in July 1994 by three employees of Malibu Interactive (previously Acme Interactive), a division of [[Malibu Comics]] based in [[Westlake Village, California]]. At that time, the primary platforms were the [[History of video games (16-bit era)|16-bit]] [[Video game console|consoles]], the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Games for these systems could be developed by small teams, anywhere from two to ten developers. As a result, it was much easier than at present to set up a [[Video game developer|game development company]], and several groups of people had already left Malibu to strike out on their own. [[Left Field Productions]] and [[Paradox Development]] being two extant companies that were founded in such a way, with others such as [[Clockwork Tortoise]] no longer in existence. Joel Jewett, a native of [[Montana]] and a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]], was at the time head of development at the rapidly shrinking Malibu Interactive. He teamed up with Mick West, a [[game programmer]], who had just completed working on \"Battletech - A Game of Armored Combat\" for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and Chris Ward, an [[game artist|artist]].\n\nIn July 1994, Neversoft was formed. They initially found work for Playmates Interactive, a then-division of [[Playmates Toys]] who were about to release a line of toys called ''[[Skeleton Warriors#Merchandise|Skeleton Warriors]]'' and wanted a video game to go along with the toys and the cartoon series. Neversoft began work on the game design and moved into offices in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]]. Neversoft worked on the [[Sega Genesis]] version for five months, over that time they hired another artist and a level designer. In December 1994, Playmates cancelled the game. They were not unhappy with the progress, but had decided that they needed to get on the [[History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era)|32-bit]] bandwagon and develop the game for the [[Sega Saturn]]. 1995 was spent developing ''[[Skeleton Warriors (video game)|Skeleton Warriors]]'' for the [[Sega Saturn]]. Over the course of 1995, Neversoft grew rapidly by hiring three programmers, five artists, a level designer, a tester and an office administrator. ''[[Skeleton Warriors#Merchandise|Skeleton Warriors]]'' was finished in time for the 1995 holiday season and Neversoft began looking for other work while they ported ''[[Skeleton Warriors#Merchandise|Skeleton Warriors]]'' to the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1996.\n\nNeversoft continued to expand during 1996, expanding to over twenty employees. They worked for six months on a game based on ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' for [[Crystal Dynamics]], which was cancelled due to financial problems with the publisher. With some excess capacity Neversoft started to develop a game of their own design, initially called ''Big Guns''. The technology developed there was used in their next project, a conversion of the PC game ''[[MDK (game)|MDK]]''. Towards the end of 1996, Neversoft sold the idea for ''Big Guns'' to [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] and they began development. 1997 was a tumultuous year for Neversoft. The ''MDK'' conversion took far longer than expected, and the ''Big Guns'' game (renamed ''Exodus'') went through numerous design changes at the behest of Sony and was eventually cancelled in November 1997. The company shrunk back to just twelve employees. Neversoft spent the next few months shopping around their technology, meeting with numerous companies and looking for work.\n\n[[File:1998 Neversoft 960.jpg|300px|thumb|right|1998 employees of Neversoft]]\n\nIn January 1998, just as Neversoft was about to run out of money, they had a fortunate meeting with [[Activision]] who were looking for someone to re-develop ''[[Apocalypse (video game)|Apocalypse]]'', a failed internal project featuring the voice of [[Bruce Willis]]. The technology developed for ''Big Guns'' turned out to be ideal for the project, Activision was impressed and Neversoft began work on ''Apocalypse''. In May 1998, ''Apocalypse'' was going very well, and Activision signed up Neversoft to develop a prototype for a [[skateboarding]] game. This proceeded slowly as they could not spare many people from ''Apocalypse''. The initial prototypes resembled the arcade game ''[[Top Skater]]''. ''Apocalypse'' wrapped up in October 1998 and development began in earnest on ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater]]'' for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. By the end of 1998, the game development was in full swing and at this time Neversoft comprised 16 people: six programmers, five artists, three level designers, one producer and Joel, the company's president.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Neversoft developed nine ''[[Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk's Pro Skater]]'' games and increased their employees to over 150.\n\nIn 2005, Neversoft developed a Western [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[open world]] game entitled ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'', alongside [[Beenox]] and [[Rebellion Developments]].\n\nIn 2006, [[Activision]] acquired the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]] from Harmonix Music Systems, as well as [[RedOctane]], and chose Neversoft as the developer. Neversoft developed several games in the franchise, breaking several records with ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' until 2010, when the games following ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock]]'' would be developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], developers of the [[Wii]] ports and ''[[Guitar Hero: Van Halen]]''<ref>[http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft Layoffs, Loss of \u2018Guitar Hero\u2019 at Neversoft]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216142213/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/rumor-layoffs-loss-of-guitar-hero-at-neversoft |date=February 16, 2010 }}</ref> In light of this, 50 employees were laid off on February 11, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=Activision Takes Axe To Guitar Hero\u2019s Neversoft, Shuts Down Luxoflux|url=http://kotaku.com/5469858/activision-takes-axe-to-guitar-heros-neversoft-shuts-down-luxoflux|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref> In May 2014 it was reported that Neversoft had been merged with ''[[Call of Duty]]'' creators [[Infinity Ward]] to create what was internally referred to as a \"super-studio\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|title=Infinity Ward, Neversoft Merging into Single Super Studio|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/infinity-ward-neversoft-merging-into-single-super-studio/1100-4909/|publisher=Giant Bomb}}</ref> Neversoft was officially made defunct on July 10, 2014, 20 years to the day of its founding, with the remaining employees attending a burning of a sculpture of the skewered eyeball from their logo that has been part of their offices before.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-11-tony-hawk-studio-neversoft-bids-farewell-burns-eyeball-effigy | title = Tony Hawk studio Neversoft bids farewell, burns eyeball effigy | first = Tom | last = Phillips | date = July 10, 2014 |  accessdate = July 11, 2014 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Release history==\n''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater'' (''THPS'') was released on the PlayStation in August 1999. Development of a sequel began immediately after its release. ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' was also developed for Activision in 2000. Like ''THPS'', the technology for this game was based on the ''Apocalypse'' engine, which was in turn based on the ''Big Guns'' engine. Neversoft was now developing two major games in parallel, and expanded into two large teams. Activision acquired Neversoft in the summer of 1999 in a stock swap deal. The founders of Neversoft and several key employees signed four-year employment agreements.\n\n''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2'' and ''Spider-Man'' were both released in 2000. Neversoft began work on ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'' specifically for the [[PlayStation 2]]. After both teams finished their projects they were merged into one large team. ''THPS3'' was developed using the [[RenderWare]] game engine. ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'' was released in 2001, followed by ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4]]'' in 2002. In 2003 Neversoft reworked the game with a more story-oriented approach in ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]'', followed by a sequel in ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]'' in 2004. Neversoft again split into two teams to begin work on the internally developed ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' and the seventh version of the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' series]] \u2014 ''[[Tony Hawk's American Wasteland]]''.\n\n''[[Tony Hawk's Project 8]]'' was developed and released in 2006. This was the first title under Neversoft that was developed as a next-gen title for the [[Xbox 360]] and the [[PlayStation 3]]. ''[[Tony Hawk's Proving Ground]]'' was released in 2007. It is the second title for the PlayStation 3 and third for Xbox 360 in the ''Tony Hawk<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' series. It was the last ''Tony Hawk'' game to be developed by Neversoft; the franchise moved to [[Robomodo]].<ref name=\"robo_mondo\">[http://www.robomodo.com/ Robomodo.com]</ref>\n\nAfter Activision acquired [[RedOctane]] and the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], [[Harmonix]] developed their last ''Guitar Hero'' game, ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'', before they were acquired by [[MTV]]. Neversoft became the developer for the ''Guitar Hero'' series beginning with ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] consoles, using their in-house game engine made from scratch instead of Harmonix's engine. Several [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]] games have been developed by Neversoft since 2007, including ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' (incorporating drums and vocals alongside guitar), ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'', ''[[Band Hero]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock]]''.\n\n==Games developed==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He was initially a wing spiker in junior high school and is currently a middle blocker. He inherits the number 10 from his idol, the former Karasuno ace known as the Little Giant. His play style makes him an excellent decoy, and though he wishes to become the team's ace, he grows to learn the importance of the decoy role and embraces it. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular. He is able to play exceptionally well when partnered with Kageyama as his setter. Hinata is passionately devoted to the sport and practices tirelessly, which leads to explosive growth as a player.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tobio Kageyama|\u5f71\u5c71 \u98db\u96c4|Kageyama Tobio}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kaito Ishikawa]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast1\" />|Scott Gibbs<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Tatsunari Kimura (2015-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Tatsuya Kageyama (2017-2018),<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\">{{cite news | first=Rafael Antonio | last=Pineda | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-04-23/haikyu-stage-play-performance-schedules-visual-title-revealed/.130725 | title=Haikyu!!

He is the team's setter and was notoriously known as the \"King of the Court\" in junior high. While prodigiously talented, Kageyama's arrogant demeanor and inability to cooperate with teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match, which deeply affected him and earned his nickname. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball. Kageyama is regarded by many to be a genius, with exceptional accuracy and instincts, and is one of the team's pillars. Nevertheless, he has poor social skills and difficulty expressing himself, often engaging in shouting matches with Hinata.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Daichi Sawamura|\u6fa4\u6751 \u5927\u5730|Sawamura Daichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]]<ref name=haikyuucast2>{{cite web|title=Satoshi Hino, Miyu Irino, Yuu Hayashi Join Haikyuu Anime Cast|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-13/satoshi-hino-miyu-irino-yuu-hayashi-join-haikyu-anime-cast|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>|Justin Doran<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Keita Tanaka (2015, 2018),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/><ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\">{{cite news | first=Rafael Antonio | last=Pineda | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-27/haikyu-5th-stage-play-new-cast-visual-debut-dates-revealed/.124542 | title=Haikyu!! 5th Stage Play's New Cast, Visual, Debut Dates Revealed | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2017-11-27 | accessdate=2019-07-15 }}</ref> Kentaro Akisawa (2016-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\"/> Sho Higano (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Sawamura is the captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He is a wing spiker, and very dependable at receiving. He helps stabilize the team with his kindness and resilience, but is also more than capable of intimidating his teammates into behaving when they get on his nerves. He usually prefers to let his fellow players work out their issues themselves rather than step in as the captain.\n\n;{{Nihongo|K\u014dshi Sugawara|\u83c5\u539f \u5b5d\u652f|Sugawara K\u014dshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Miyu Irino]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast2\" />|[[Adam Gibbs]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: [[Hiroki Ino]] (2015-2017),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Naoki Tanaka (2018),<ref name=\"ann 2017-11-27\"/> Ryu Ichinose (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Sugawara is the vice captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School.

He is cheerful, soft-spoken, and empathetic - Coach Ukai notes that he has the full trust of his teammates. Sugawara is often able to devise new tactics and ideas, as well as sense if a fellow player is off their game.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ry\u016bnosuke Tanaka|\u7530\u4e2d \u9f8d\u4e4b\u4ecb|Tanaka Ry\u016bnosuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Hayashi]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast2\" />|Greg Cote<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: [[Kouhei Shiota]] (2015-2018),<ref name=\"ann 2015-07-15\"/> Ko Kanegae (2019-present)<ref name=\"oricon 2019-07-14\"/>\n:Tanaka is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker.

He's considered the team's ace and powerhouse. His long hair, tall stature, and impressive strength often intimidate others at first, while some onlookers even suggest he is full-grown man who was held back. Despite this, he is timid and sometimes struggles with self-doubt, often referred to as having a \"glass heart\".

Nishinoya is considered the backbone of the team, as his specialties are receives and block recovery. He has a close friendship with Asahi, refusing to play unless the latter returned to his role as the team's ace. Like Tanaka, he adores Shimizu, and mentions that one of the main reasons he enrolled at Karasuno in the first place was because he liked the girls' uniforms.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chikara Ennoshita|\u7e01\u4e0b \u529b|Ennoshita Chikara}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Toshiki Masuda]]<ref name=haikyuucast4>{{cite web|title=Hiroshi Kamiya, Kaori Nazuka, Daisuke Namikawa Joins Haikyuu!!

Each player of Aoba Johsai has been said to have the ability to become an ace player.\n;{{Nihongo|T\u014dru Oikawa|\u53ca\u5ddd \u5fb9|Oikawa T\u014dru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]<ref name=\"haikyuucast4\" />|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Oikawa is the setter and third-year captain of the Aoba Johsai High School volleyball club and is widely regarded as the ace setter, introduced as a main antagonist in manga and anime [[Haikyuu!!]]. He was also Kageyama's senior when they both attended Kitagawa Daiichi Middle School. He is called \"The Great King\" by Hinata.\n:Despite his flirtatious nature and childishness, Oikawa is an excellent, well-rounded player and is extremely serious about volleyball. He's known to have a \"disgusting personality\" amongst both opponents and his own teammates because of his smug attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blas\u00e9 exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weaknesses.\n:He works extremely hard, as is evident by his vigorous practices and injuries caused by overworking in training before. His own teammates have pointed out his rigorous schedule. In addition, Oikawa spends time watching past games of his rivals, observing their movements ahead of time and strategizing how to defeat them. His intelligence and game sense are also unparalleled, as shown when he points out his opponents' weaknesses in a short period of time. He is also capable of rising his teammates' performance by passing them the perfect tosses, no matter their habits or his relationships towards them. \n:In his free time, he coaches his nephew and other children at Lil Tykes Volleyball Classroom. He and the third years as well as the entire team shares a very close bond. Despite being exasperated by Oikawa's antics, the team deeply respects him. He and Iwaizumi are childhood best friends and have played volleyball together for a long time. They are completely in sync with each other's thoughts both on and out of court. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Issei Matsukawa|\u677e\u5ddd \u4e00\u9759|Matsukawa Issei}} \n:{{voiced by|Isamu Y\u016bsen|Paul Locklear<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Matsukawa is one of the middle blockers and a third-year student. He is cool headed and although serious looking, Matsukawa is shown to sometimes carry a joking air, such as calling out his food orders in the middle of a match. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Hanamaki. The two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Hanamaki. He enjoys Oikawa's endless jokes towards Iwaizumi, spectating their banter along with Hanamaki, or occasionally chiming in with their own teasing remarks.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Takahiro Hanamaki|\u82b1\u5dfb \u8cb4\u5927|Hanamaki Takahiro}}\n:{{voiced by|T\u014dru Sakurai|Jack Ivy<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Hanamaki is a wing spiker and a third-year student. Hanamaki is usually calm and collected. He is observant and perceptive, able to read the game situation quite well, and doesn't talk much during games. Despite this, he does have a sense of humour, especially with the third years, and generally gets along pretty well with the other team members. He is seen flashing the peace sign when Oikawa compliments him. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Matsukawa. These two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Matsukawa.\n\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Iwaizumi|\u5ca9\u6cc9 \u4e00|Iwaizumi Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|Benjamin McLaughlin<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Iwaizumi is the ace and third-year vice-captain of the team, as well as one of the wing spikers and Oikawa's childhood friend and \"pillar.\" Iwaizumi is a stubborn but reliable teammate, often filling in Oikawa's spot as a morale booster if needed. He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aoba J\u014dsai team to look up to and respect him. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{nihongo|Shinji Watari|\u6e21 \u89aa\u6cbb|Watari Shinji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Arthur Lounsbery]]|Blake Jackson<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Watari is a second-year student and the team's libero. He seems to enjoy being challenged, due to the fact that he smiled when Nishinoya used the same move as him when he set from the back row. It is shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Ky\u014dtani after he misses a point, regardless of Ky\u014dtani's lack of proximity with the rest of the team. Before he became the libero, it was mentioned that he was actually a setter, however it is unknown if he ever played as a setter at Aoba J\u014dsai High.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shigeru Yahaba|\u77e2\u5dfehas the mm\u79c0|Yahaba Shigeru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kengo Kawanishi]]|Jeremy Gee<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Yahaba is a second-year and a setter. He is a show off by nature. He doesn't like Kyotani, since he had stopped coming to practice, but was still chosen as a regular. He is the only person in the team who scolds Kyotani to his face, asking him to play for the team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Y\u016btar\u014d Kindaichi|\u91d1\u7530\u4e00 \u52c7\u592a\u90ce|Kindaichi Y\u016btar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Makoto Furukawa]]|[[David Matranga]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kindaichi is a first-year and a middle blocker. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as \"Turnip Head.\" Being the one who raised his voice against Kageyama during middle school, he feels both guilty and rivalry towards him. He keeps questioning Hinata about Kageyama's welfare, although when he meets Kageyama, he only challenges him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Akira Kunimi|\u56fd\u898b \u82f1|Kunimi Akira}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Mark Laskowski|Mark X.

He is also known as \"Curtain Hair.\" He has a lazy personality, due to which he usually tends to be lax and not play to his utmost strength. Kageyama did not like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kentar\u014d Ky\u014dtani|\u4eac\u8c37 \u8ce2\u592a\u90ce|Ky\u014dtani Kentar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!!

His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.\n:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.\n\n===Nekoma High===\nThe word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese. Thus, when there used to be rivalry between Nekoma and Karasuno, it was often referred to as the \"trashcan showdown\" or \"Cat Vs. Crow\". Their team basically builds its play with strong receivers, never letting the ball drop and strategies developed by its smart setter.\n;{{nihongo|Tetsur\u014d Kuroo|\u9ed2\u5c3e \u9244\u6717|Kuroo Tetsur\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]]<ref name=nekomacast>{{cite web|title=Yuichi Nakamura, Yuki Kaji and Shinnosuke Tachibana Join Hakyuu!!

He is also childhood friends with Kenma. He is called as 'scheming captain', as he is great with strategy, and also likes to tease people. Very different from his childhood friend, Kenma, who is very serious and silent, Kuroo is quite playful and sly. He is deemed to be talented middle blocker by coach Ukai Jr. During practice matches, he gives a lot of tips and advice to Tsukishima (particularly) about blocking, as he wants to fulfill his coach's dream of battling it out with Karasuno at the Nationals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nobuyuki Kai|\u6d77 \u4fe1\u884c|Kai Nobuyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takanori Hoshino]]|Joel McCray<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kai is a third-year student at Nekoma High and is the vice-captain and wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out, and also has bad luck when it comes to girls. He and Kenma would often have arguments, since he believes in putting in all his power and going all out, but Kenma doesn't like to spend his energy. He too is a fan of Shimizu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kenma Kozume|\u5b64\u722a \u7814\u78e8|Kozume Kenma}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]<ref name=\"nekomacast\" />|[[Clint Bickham]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Takato Nagata (2016-present)<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\"/>\n:Kenma is a second-year student at Nekoma High and a setter for the volleyball team. He is an introvert, choosing to play video games instead of playing outside and doesn't interact well with people. But he is very skilled at volleyball, since he is very observant due to him being nervous around people, and has the ability to come up with excellent strategies to counter the opposite team. He is childhood friends with Kuroo. He also became good friends with Hinata after meeting by coincidence when the both of them happen to get lost. Their encounter had taken place before they'd met officially for a practice game between their schools. He is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' for the Nekoma team, and all of his teammates are very protective of him and admire him greatly. It is shown that he texts Hinata often, revealing that even though they have opposite personalities, they are still good friends with each other.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sh\u014dhei Fukunaga|\u798f\u6c38 \u62db\u5e73|Fukunaga Sh\u014dhei}}\n:{{voiced by|Sh\u014dta Ch\u014dnan|Matthew Carter<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Fukunaga is a second-year student at Nekoma and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality. He is the first player who was able to stop Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick strike fully. His positive attitude shows most when he praises Hinata for being able to come up with a new shot in the middle of the game, after the weird quick was stopped. He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they were playing as rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lev Haiba|\u7070\u7fbd \u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30d5|Haiba Ri\u0113bu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mark Ishii]]|Mike Yager<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>}}\n:Lev is a first-year at Nekoma and a middle blocker.

He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|\u9752\u6839 \u9ad8\u4f38|Aone Takanobu}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended for Hinata when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Obara|\u5c0f\u539f \u8c4a|Obara Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|Isamu Yusen|Jason Duga}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kousuke Sakunami|\u4f5c\u4e26 \u6d69\u8f14|Sakunami Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|Mao \u014cnishi|Joel McCray}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and libero for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kanji Koganegawa |\u9ec4\u91d1\u5ddd\u8cab\u81f3|Koganegawa Kanji}}\n:{{voiced by|Masayuki Shouji|Mason Butler}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Haikyu!!

Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very new to setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead.

He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he is never bothered by how strong the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a \"weird\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keiji Akaashi|\u8d64\u8466 \u4eac\u6cbb|Akaashi Keiji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Jeremy Gee}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy.

Their play style centers around the powerful \"left cannon\", i.e., around the ace wing spiker.

He was initially a wing spiker in junior high school and is currently a middle blocker. He inherits the number 10 from his idol, the former Karasuno ace known as the Little Giant. His play style makes him an excellent decoy, and though he wishes to become the team's ace, he grows to learn the importance of the decoy role and embraces it. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. In spite of his small size, clumsiness, and poor fundamentals, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and jumping ability earn him a spot as a regular. He is able to play exceptionally well when partnered with Kageyama as his setter.

He is the team's setter and was notoriously known as the \"King of the Court\" in junior high. While prodigiously talented, Kageyama's arrogant demeanor and inability to cooperate with teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match, which deeply affected him and earned his nickname. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was not accepted. At Karasuno, he forms an unlikely duo with Hinata and begins to learn the importance of teamwork in volleyball. Kageyama is regarded by many to be a genius, with exceptional accuracy and instincts, and is one of the team's pillars.

He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aoba J\u014dsai team to look up to and respect him. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T\u014dru respectively) form  \"\u4e00\u5fb9\" meaning \"obstinate\" or \"dauntless\".\n\n;{{nihongo|Shinji Watari|\u6e21 \u89aa\u6cbb|Watari Shinji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Arthur Lounsbery]]|Blake Jackson<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Watari is a second-year student and the team's libero. He seems to enjoy being challenged, due to the fact that he smiled when Nishinoya used the same move as him when he set from the back row. It is shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Ky\u014dtani after he misses a point, regardless of Ky\u014dtani's lack of proximity with the rest of the team. Before he became the libero, it was mentioned that he was actually a setter, however it is unknown if he ever played as a setter at Aoba J\u014dsai High.\n\n;{{nihongo|Shigeru Yahaba|\u77e2\u5dfehas the mm\u79c0|Yahaba Shigeru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kengo Kawanishi]]|Jeremy Gee<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Yahaba is a second-year and a setter. He is a show off by nature. He doesn't like Kyotani, since he had stopped coming to practice, but was still chosen as a regular. He is the only person in the team who scolds Kyotani to his face, asking him to play for the team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Y\u016btar\u014d Kindaichi|\u91d1\u7530\u4e00 \u52c7\u592a\u90ce|Kindaichi Y\u016btar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Makoto Furukawa]]|[[David Matranga]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kindaichi is a first-year and a middle blocker. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as \"Turnip Head.\" Being the one who raised his voice against Kageyama during middle school, he feels both guilty and rivalry towards him. He keeps questioning Hinata about Kageyama's welfare, although when he meets Kageyama, he only challenges him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Akira Kunimi|\u56fd\u898b \u82f1|Kunimi Akira}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Mark Laskowski|Mark X.

He is also known as \"Curtain Hair.\" He has a lazy personality, due to which he usually tends to be lax and not play to his utmost strength. Kageyama did not like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kentar\u014d Ky\u014dtani|\u4eac\u8c37 \u8ce2\u592a\u90ce|Ky\u014dtani Kentar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!!

His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.\n:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.\n\n===Nekoma High===\nThe word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese. Thus, when there used to be rivalry between Nekoma and Karasuno, it was often referred to as the \"trashcan showdown\" or \"Cat Vs. Crow\". Their team basically builds its play with strong receivers, never letting the ball drop and strategies developed by its smart setter.\n;{{nihongo|Tetsur\u014d Kuroo|\u9ed2\u5c3e \u9244\u6717|Kuroo Tetsur\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]]<ref name=nekomacast>{{cite web|title=Yuichi Nakamura, Yuki Kaji and Shinnosuke Tachibana Join Hakyuu!!

He is also childhood friends with Kenma. He is called as 'scheming captain', as he is great with strategy, and also likes to tease people. Very different from his childhood friend, Kenma, who is very serious and silent, Kuroo is quite playful and sly. He is deemed to be talented middle blocker by coach Ukai Jr. During practice matches, he gives a lot of tips and advice to Tsukishima (particularly) about blocking, as he wants to fulfill his coach's dream of battling it out with Karasuno at the Nationals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nobuyuki Kai|\u6d77 \u4fe1\u884c|Kai Nobuyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takanori Hoshino]]|Joel McCray<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Kai is a third-year student at Nekoma High and is the vice-captain and wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out, and also has bad luck when it comes to girls. He and Kenma would often have arguments, since he believes in putting in all his power and going all out, but Kenma doesn't like to spend his energy. He too is a fan of Shimizu.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kenma Kozume|\u5b64\u722a \u7814\u78e8|Kozume Kenma}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]<ref name=\"nekomacast\" />|[[Clint Bickham]]<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Played by: Takato Nagata (2016-present)<ref name=\"ann 2018-04-23\"/>\n:Kenma is a second-year student at Nekoma High and a setter for the volleyball team. He is an introvert, choosing to play video games instead of playing outside and doesn't interact well with people. But he is very skilled at volleyball, since he is very observant due to him being nervous around people, and has the ability to come up with excellent strategies to counter the opposite team. He is childhood friends with Kuroo. He also became good friends with Hinata after meeting by coincidence when the both of them happen to get lost. Their encounter had taken place before they'd met officially for a practice game between their schools. He is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' for the Nekoma team, and all of his teammates are very protective of him and admire him greatly. It is shown that he texts Hinata often, revealing that even though they have opposite personalities, they are still good friends with each other.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sh\u014dhei Fukunaga|\u798f\u6c38 \u62db\u5e73|Fukunaga Sh\u014dhei}}\n:{{voiced by|Sh\u014dta Ch\u014dnan|Matthew Carter<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Fukunaga is a second-year student at Nekoma and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality. He is the first player who was able to stop Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick strike fully. His positive attitude shows most when he praises Hinata for being able to come up with a new shot in the middle of the game, after the weird quick was stopped. He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they were playing as rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lev Haiba|\u7070\u7fbd \u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30d5|Haiba Ri\u0113bu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mark Ishii]]|Mike Yager<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>}}\n:Lev is a first-year at Nekoma and a middle blocker. He has a happy-go-lucky and cheerful personality. He is the tallest of the team, also having an ambition to become Nekoma's ace. Even though he is still very new to volleyball, he has talent that makes some people believe he will grow stronger. Kenma even thought that Lev looks like Hinata.\n\n;{{nihongo|Y\u016bki Shibayama|\u829d\u5c71 \u512a\u751f|Shibayama Y\u016bki}}\n:{{voiced by|Takumi Watanabe|Santry Rush<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n:Shibayama is a first-year student at Nekoma and is a libero.\n\n===Datekougyou High===\nThe team specializes in blocking, earning the nickname \"Iron Wall\".\n;{{nihongo|Kaname Moniwa|\u8302\u5ead \u8981|Moniwa Kaname}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takashi Onozuka]]|Patrick Poole<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Moniwa is a third year student at Dateko High.

He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.\n\n;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|\u9752\u6839 \u9ad8\u4f38|Aone Takanobu}}\n:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended for Hinata when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yutaka Obara|\u5c0f\u539f \u8c4a|Obara Yutaka}}\n:{{voiced by|Isamu Yusen|Jason Duga}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kousuke Sakunami|\u4f5c\u4e26 \u6d69\u8f14|Sakunami Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|Mao \u014cnishi|Joel McCray}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and libero for the volleyball team.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kanji Koganegawa |\u9ec4\u91d1\u5ddd\u8cab\u81f3|Koganegawa Kanji}}\n:{{voiced by|Masayuki Shouji|Mason Butler}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Haikyu!!

Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very new to setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead. He has an extremely energetic personality and believes that a player should give everything they have in a game. He, too, later ends up being friends with Hinata.\n\n===Fukurodani Academy===\n\nThe word 'Fukuro' in the school name means 'owl'.

He is called 'simple-minded' by his teammates and is easily flattered by praise, as shown by Hinata and his teammates. He especially like praise from Akaashi, and has begged him multiple times for it. In spite of this, he is a very talented volleyball player, being one of the top 5 aces in the country. He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he is never bothered by how strong the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a \"weird\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals.\n\n;{{nihongo|Keiji Akaashi|\u8d64\u8466 \u4eac\u6cbb|Akaashi Keiji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Jeremy Gee}}<ref name=\"Season 2 Dub\"/>\n:Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy.

He is also a talented setter.\n\n===Shiratorizawa Academy===\nThe word 'Shiratori' in the school name \"Shiratorizawa\" means 'swan'. They were the undefeated champions in Miyagi prefecture. Their play style centers around the powerful \"left cannon\", i.e., around the ace wing spiker. Coach Ukai Jr has commented that the Shiratori team's power is more of an addition of each player's strength, as compared to other teams' multiplication, since each player only plays to his own skills.\n;{{nihongo|Wakatoshi Ushijima|\u725b\u5cf6\u82e5\u5229|Ushijima Wakatoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|Ry\u014dta Takeuchi|Joe Daniels}}<ref name=\"Shiratorizawa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-14/3rd-haikyu-anime-casts-shiratorizawa-gakuen-volleyball-club/.104311|title=3rd Haikyu!!

He is known as the 'Guess Monster' as his blocking style is guess blocking, which involves guessing which spiker the opposite team's setter will pass the ball to, and also where the spiker will hit the ball. His guesses are known to be either 120% or 0%, since if they are right, he will definitely block them, but if they are wrong, there is no way he can stop them.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tsutomu Goshiki|\u4e94\u8272\u5de5|Goshiki Tsutomu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shimba Tsuchiya]]|Howard Wang}}<ref name=\"Shiratorizawa\"/><ref name=\":0\" />\n:Goshiki is a first year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a wing spiker for the volleyball team.

He, unlike the other Shiratorizawa players, did not receive a sports scholarship to Shiratorizawa.

It met in [[Washington, D.C.]] from March 4, 1931, to March 4, 1933, during the last two years of [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Herbert Hoover's presidency]]. The apportionment of seats in this [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the [[United States Census, 1910|Thirteenth Decennial Census of the United States in 1910]]. The Senate had a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority.  The House started with a very slim Republican majority, but by the time it first met in December 1931, the Democrats had gained a majority through special elections.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Major events ==\n{{See also|1931 in the United States|1932 in the United States|1933 in the United States}}\n\n* Ongoing: [[Great Depression]]\n* January 12, 1932: [[Hattie Wyatt Caraway]] of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the United States Senate.
