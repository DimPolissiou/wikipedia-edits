The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to [[San Antonio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Greater [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Boston]] and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director [[Jack Swarbrick]] announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.<ref>{{cite

their current home uniforms]]\nNotre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. In recent years, neither jersey included the player's name on the back, but names were included during the Dan Devine and Gerry Faust eras. However, for the Irish's [[Hawaii Bowl|Hawai'i Bowl]] appearance in 2008 vs. the [[Hawaii Warriors football|University of Hawai'i]], Notre Dame once again wore last names on their jerseys. Gold pants, with a small ND logo just below the left waist, are worn with both home and away jerseys.\n[[File:Maillots ND d\u00e9placement.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Former quarterback Brady Quinn in the current away uniform]]\nNotre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome.\"  Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc.\n\nOver the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season \u2013 or more \u2013 at a time. Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for \"special\" occasions. Often on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game, and in the loss to [[Nile Kinnick]]-led [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the Green jerseys as a reward to his senior players, as well finally ending the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061107aab.html|title=Notre Dame Football Team to Wear Throwback Uniforms Against USC|work=cstv.com|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey: a white jersey with green numbers. Champion supplied football jerseys for The University of Notre Dame for over 50 years until they switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame Athletic department will begin wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour.\n[[File:Tyler Eifert.jpg|thumb|110px|Former tight end Tyler Eifert.]]\nDuring Gerry Faust's tenure (1981\u201385), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The navy blue jerseys returned in 1984.\n\nNo uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card which lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by [[Ralph Guglielmi]], [[George Izo]], [[Daryle Lamonica]], [[Coley O'Brien]], [[Joe Montana]], Michael Floyd, [[Rick Mirer]] and [[Ron Powlus]], among others.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\">{{cite web| url=http://www.und.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/FBRecSuppAll-TimeRoster |title=ND Archives: All-Time Roster |publisher=und.cstv.com |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}</ref> Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen ([[Elmer Layden]]) a Heisman Trophy Winner ([[Paul Hornung]]) and a National Title winning Quarterback ([[Terry Hanratty]]).<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/> Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/>\n\nIn 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For the Shamrock Series games Notre Dame and their outfitters have announced that the school will wear specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Notre Dame Stadium===\n[[File:Notredamestadiumgamedayband.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Notre Dame Stadium on game day, with student section and band]]\n{{main| Notre Dame Stadium}}\n\nNotre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a [[seating capacity]] of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.<ref name=\"capacity\" /> The ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranks Notre Dame Stadium as # 2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".<ref name=\"Sporting News Cathedrals\">{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/Default.asp?cp1=1|title=Sporting News College Football Cathedrals|work=MSNBC|accessdate=January 30, 2007 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010912195116/http://msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/default.asp?cp1=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 12, 2001}}</ref> and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400&nbsp;million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season.\n\n===Cartier Field===\n{{main| Cartier Field}}\nCartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Notre Dame's practice facility still bears the Cartier Field name. Most ND practices take place on Cartier Field.\n\n===Guglielmino Athletics Complex===\nKnown by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family.\n\n===Irish Athletic Center===\nThe indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and avideo board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at it's peak.\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{main|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries}}\n\n[[File:Jeweledshillelagh.jpg|thumb|250px|The First [[Jeweled Shillelagh]], awarded to the winner of the annual USC vs. Notre Dame game.]]\nNotre Dame has rivalries with several universities.

The series has been quite frequent in the near past since the rivalry was reunited beginning in 1978. It is heightened by the two schools' competition for all-time win percentage, which Michigan leads again since 2016.

Some of these are:\n* The tradition of having 23.9 karat gold in the helmet paint continues, with the painting process provided by Hydro Graphics, Inc. and no longer by student managers. The gold particles that are used on the helmet were collected from the re-gilding on the Notre Dame dome in 2007.  During the 2011 season, however, a new helmet paint scheme was introduced; while retaining the basic gold helmet and grey facemask look, the \"new\" gold is much more reflective than the \"old\"; there have already been several variations of this new \"gold chrome\" look, including \"brick\" and \"fish-scale\" texturing.<ref name=\"50 yrs of CFB\" />\n*Formerly, prior to the start of the game, the team attended mass in semi-formal attire at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana|Sacred Heart Basilica]].

The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to [[San Antonio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Greater [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Boston]] and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director [[Jack Swarbrick]] announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.<ref>{{cite

their current home uniforms]]\nNotre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. In recent years, neither jersey included the player's name on the back, but names were included during the Dan Devine and Gerry Faust eras. However, for the Irish's [[Hawaii Bowl|Hawai'i Bowl]] appearance in 2008 vs. the [[Hawaii Warriors football|University of Hawai'i]], Notre Dame once again wore last names on their jerseys. Gold pants, with a small ND logo just below the left waist, are worn with both home and away jerseys.\n[[File:Maillots ND d\u00e9placement.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Former quarterback Brady Quinn in the current away uniform]]\nNotre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome.\"  Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc.\n\nOver the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season \u2013 or more \u2013 at a time. Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for \"special\" occasions. Often on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game, and in the loss to [[Nile Kinnick]]-led [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the Green jerseys as a reward to his senior players, as well finally ending the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061107aab.html|title=Notre Dame Football Team to Wear Throwback Uniforms Against USC|work=cstv.com|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey: a white jersey with green numbers. Champion supplied football jerseys for The University of Notre Dame for over 50 years until they switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame Athletic department will begin wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour.\n[[File:Tyler Eifert.jpg|thumb|110px|Former tight end Tyler Eifert.]]\nDuring Gerry Faust's tenure (1981\u201385), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The navy blue jerseys returned in 1984.\n\nNo uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card which lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by [[Ralph Guglielmi]], [[George Izo]], [[Daryle Lamonica]], [[Coley O'Brien]], [[Joe Montana]], Michael Floyd, [[Rick Mirer]] and [[Ron Powlus]], among others.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\">{{cite web| url=http://www.und.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/FBRecSuppAll-TimeRoster |title=ND Archives: All-Time Roster |publisher=und.cstv.com |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}</ref> Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen ([[Elmer Layden]]) a Heisman Trophy Winner ([[Paul Hornung]]) and a National Title winning Quarterback ([[Terry Hanratty]]).<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/> Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/>\n\nIn 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For the Shamrock Series games Notre Dame and their outfitters have announced that the school will wear specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Notre Dame Stadium===\n[[File:Notredamestadiumgamedayband.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Notre Dame Stadium on game day, with student section and band]]\n{{main| Notre Dame Stadium}}\n\nNotre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a [[seating capacity]] of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.<ref name=\"capacity\" /> The ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranks Notre Dame Stadium as # 2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".<ref name=\"Sporting News Cathedrals\">{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/Default.asp?cp1=1|title=Sporting News College Football Cathedrals|work=MSNBC|accessdate=January 30, 2007 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010912195116/http://msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/default.asp?cp1=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 12, 2001}}</ref> and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400&nbsp;million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season.\n\n===Cartier Field===\n{{main| Cartier Field}}\nCartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Notre Dame's practice facility still bears the Cartier Field name. Most ND practices take place on Cartier Field.\n\n===Guglielmino Athletics Complex===\nKnown by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family.\n\n===Irish Athletic Center===\nThe indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and avideo board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at it's peak.\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{main|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries}}\n\n[[File:Jeweledshillelagh.jpg|thumb|250px|The First [[Jeweled Shillelagh]], awarded to the winner of the annual USC vs. Notre Dame game.]]\nNotre Dame has rivalries with several universities.

The series has been quite frequent in the near past since the rivalry was reunited beginning in 1978. It is heightened by the two schools' competition for all-time win percentage, which Michigan leads again since 2016.

Some of these are:\n* The tradition of having 23.9 karat gold in the helmet paint continues, with the painting process provided by Hydro Graphics, Inc. and no longer by student managers. The gold particles that are used on the helmet were collected from the re-gilding on the Notre Dame dome in 2007.  During the 2011 season, however, a new helmet paint scheme was introduced; while retaining the basic gold helmet and grey facemask look, the \"new\" gold is much more reflective than the \"old\"; there have already been several variations of this new \"gold chrome\" look, including \"brick\" and \"fish-scale\" texturing.<ref name=\"50 yrs of CFB\" />\n*Formerly, prior to the start of the game, the team attended mass in semi-formal attire at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana|Sacred Heart Basilica]].

Karunanidhi]] next to him.]]\nUntil 1955, Ganesan was a staunch sympathizer of the ''[[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]]''. Once, he went to the [[Tirumala]] town in [[Tirupati]] district and worshiped [[Lord Venkateswara]] in the [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala|world-famous temple]] there. Due to this act, he was heavily criticized by his party men; as DMK propounded atheism and looked down worshiping God. Ganesan was very hurt by this incident.\n\nLater in 1961, Ganesan became a strong supporter of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Due to his popularity, he was requested to be part of the National Congress Tamil Nadu. His respect for [[Kamaraj]] made him support Congress. He was made the [[Rajya Sabha]] Member of Parliament by then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. Indira Gandhi's death in 1984 also brought Ganesan's political career to an end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywood.com/book-review-legends-indian-cinema-sivaji-ganesan |title=Book Review: The Legends Of Indian Cinema&nbsp;\u2013 Sivaji Ganesan &#124; Bollywood.com : Entertainment news, movie, music and fashion reviews |publisher=Bollywood.com |accessdate=5 May 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708083213/http://www.bollywood.com/book-review-legends-indian-cinema-sivaji-ganesan |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 1988, he floated his own political party ([[Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani]]) and contested in only 50 seats, trying to play safe instead of contesting in all seats which possibly cost him the chance to win the elections because 50 seats would not make a significant difference to any election result.\n\nIn 1989, he became the President of the Tamil Nadu wing of the Janata Dal.\n\nUnlike his highly successful acting career, his political career was rather unsuccessful.<ref name=\"lodestar\" />\n\n== Family ==\nGanesan was the fourth son of his family.

During his visit there, he was honoured by being made the honorary mayor of [[Niagara Falls, New York]] for one day and was presented the [[Freedom of the City|golden key to the city]]. The only other Indian who has had this honour before Ganesan was Jawaharlal Nehru.  When Sivaji returned from America, there was a huge crowd to receive him at the Madras Airport and MGR was there. When Sivaji returned from Egypt after winning the best actor award, there was a huge crowd to receive him at the Madras Airport.
