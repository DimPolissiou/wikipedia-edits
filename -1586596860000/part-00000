It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

However, the fortifications were not perfect, and when [[List of Swedish Field Marshals|Swedish Field Marshal]] [[Lennart Torstenson]] invaded Jutland, he was able to break through the ramparts.  It was [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] who was finally able to complete the plans for the fortification, also adding a flank fortification on nearby Bers Odde as suggested by Danish Imperial Marshal [[Anders Bille]].\n\nOn 15 December 1650, the King signed the document giving the town its first privileges, and work on the new fortifications could begin.  In 1651, the town was named Frederiksodde (Frederick's Point) after the king, and on 22 April 1664, it was given the new [[Latinized name]] of Fredericia.\n\nEvery 6 July, the town of Fredericia holds a festival to commemorate the 1849 [[Battle of Fredericia]], fought during the [[First War of Schleswig]], in which Danish troops won a victory over the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] rebels who were laying siege to the town.

Fredericia's landmark, ''Landsoldaten'', was unveiled on 6 July 1858.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assistens.dk/bissen.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031425/http://assistens.dk/bissen.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Present==\nThe municipality today is part of the [[East Jutland metropolitan area]] with 1.2M inhabitants,<ref>{{cite book\n |title       = Vision \u00d8stjylland\n |url         = http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/D57AF934-C471-41E6-A8B0-389AF80A94A6/0/Visionsoplaeg20082008.pdf\n |publisher   = Styregruppen for projekt Byudvikling i \u00d8stjylland\n |language    = Danish\n |accessdate  = 12 September 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225003300/http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/D57AF934-C471-41E6-A8B0-389AF80A94A6/0/Visionsoplaeg20082008.pdf\n |archivedate = 25 February 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> and is the site of Fredericia municipality's municipal council.\n\nThe town is one of Denmark's largest traffic [[transportation hub|hubs]].\n\nThe town is a major [[barracks]], home to the [[Royal Danish Army]]'s Signals Regiment (''[[Telegrafregimentet]]''), which is located at Rye's Barracks (''Ryes Kaserne'') and B\u00fclow's Barracks (''B\u00fclows Kaserne'').\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Annette Jensen-IPH-TTH-20160403 4.jpg|thumb|140px|Annette Jensen, 2016]]\n* [[Hartvig Philip R\u00e9e]] (1778\u20131859) a Jewish-Danish merchant and author\n* [[Poul Pagh]] (1796\u20131870) a Danish merchant and shipowner\n* [[Magdalene Thoresen]] (1819\u20131903) a Norwegian poet, novelist, short story writer and playwright \n* [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (1857\u20131943), a Danish realist writer, shared the 1917 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]\n* [[Frederick Brockhausen]] (1858\u20131929) a cigar maker, trade union activist and politician in [[Milwaukee]]\n* [[Vilhelm Buhl]] (1881\u20131954) was the 11th [[Prime Minister of Denmark]]\n* [[Svend Melsing]] (1888\u20131946), actor, theatre director and playwright \n* Dr [[Erik Holtved]] (1899\u20131981) a Danish artist, archaeologist, linguist and [[ethnologist]]\n* [[Ellen Krause]] (1905\u20141990) a Danish artist and an [[Odsherred Painters]] \n* [[Tage Skou-Hansen]] (1925\u20132015) a Danish writer, editor and scholar\n* [[Cecil B\u00f8dker]] (born 1927) a Danish writer of young adult fiction books and poet \n* [[Erik Moseholm]] (1930\u20132012) a Danish jazz bassist, composer, bandleader of the [[DR Big Band]]\n* [[J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp]] (born 1968), businessman, former CEO of [[Lego Group]]\n* [[Christian Holten Bonke]] (born 1973) a Danish documentary filmmaker and screenwriter\n\n=== Sport ===\n* [[Thomas S\u00f8rensen]] (born 1976), footballer\n* [[Patrick Hougaard]] (born 1989) a Danish motorcycle speedway rider\n* [[Annette Jensen]] (born 1991) a Danish handball player\n* [[Sara Thygesen]] (born 1991) a Danish badminton player, specializing in doubles play.\n* [[Peter Kj\u00e6r (footballer) | Peter Kj\u00e6r]] (born 1965) a Danish [[goalkeeper]]\n* [[Katrine Veje]] (Born 1991) a Danish Football Player\n\n==Twin towns==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[H\u00e4rn\u00f6sand]], Sweden, since 1948\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Herford]], Germany, since 1987\n*{{flagicon|Greenland}} [[Ilulissat]], Greenland, since 1962\n*{{flagicon|FIN}} [[Kokkola]], Finland, 1948\n*{{flagicon|NOR}} [[Kristiansund]], Norway, since 1948\n*{{flagicon|Lithuania}} [[\u0160iauliai]], Lithuania, since 1993\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fredericia municipality]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Fredericia}}\n{{NIE Poster}}\n*{{wikivoyage-inline|Fredericia}}\n* {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Fredericia |volume=11 |short=x}}\n\n{{Municipal seats of Denmark}}\n{{30 most populous cities of Denmark}}\n\n[[Category:Municipal seats of the Region of Southern Denmark]]\n[[Category:Municipal seats of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Cities and towns in the Region of Southern Denmark]]\n[[Category:Forts in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns of the North Sea]]\n[[Category:Planned cities]]\n[[Category:Fredericia Municipality]]\n[[Category:1650 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1650]]\n", "name_user": "Nardog", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:fixingDanish IPA", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericia"}

Japanese Canadians are mostly concentrated in [[Western Canada]], especially in the province of [[British Columbia]], which hosts the largest Japanese community in the country with the majority of them living in and around [[Vancouver]]. In 2016, there were 121,485 Japanese Canadians throughout Canada.<ref name=\"Japanese Canadians\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=1&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105396&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=95&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF= |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |author=[[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Generations ==\nThe term [[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]] (\u65e5\u7cfb) was coined by sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations. Japanese descendants living overseas have special names for each of their generations. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numerals]] with the Japanese word for [[generation]] (''sei'' \u4e16):ada:\n*[[Issei]] (\u4e00\u4e16) \u2013 The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before moving to Canada.\n*[[Nisei]] (\u4e8c\u4e16) \u2013 The second generation, born in Canada to Issei parents not born in Canada.\n*[[Sansei]] (\u4e09\u4e16) \u2013 The third generation, born in Canada to Nisei parents born in Canada.\n*[[Yonsei (Japanese diaspora)|Yonsei]] (\u56db\u4e16) \u2013 The fourth generation, born in Canada to Sansei parents born in Canada.\n*[[Gosei (Japanese diaspora)|Gosei]] (\u4e94\u4e16) \u2013 The fifth generation, born in Canada to Yonsei parents born in Canada.\n\n==History==\nThe first Japanese settler in Canada was [[Manzo Nagano]], who lived in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] in 1877 (a mountain in the province was named after him in 1977). The first generation, or [[Issei]], mostly came to [[Vancouver Island]], the [[Fraser Valley]] and [[Rivers Inlet]] from fishing villages on the islands of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and [[Honsh\u016b]] between 1877 and 1928. Since 1967, the second wave of immigrants were usually highly educated and resided in urban areas.<ref>Ken Adachi, ''The enemy that never was: A history of the Japanese Canadians'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1976)</ref>\n\nUntil 1948, Japanese-Canadians\u2014both ''Issei'' and Canadian-born ''Nisei''\u2014were denied the right to vote. Those born in the 1950s and 1960s in Canada are mostly [[Sansei]], third generation. Sansei usually have little knowledge of the [[Japanese language]]. Over 75% of the ''Sansei'' have married non-Japanese. ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generally do not identify themselves as fully Japanese,but as Canadians first, who happen to be of Japanese ancestry.\n\nThe younger generation of Japanese-Canadians born in the late 20th century are mostly ''Yonsei'', fourth generation. Many ''Yonsei'' are of mixed racial descent. According to [[Statistics Canada]]'s 2001 census of population information, Japanese-Canadians were the Canadian visible minority group most likely to marry or live common-law with a non-Japanese partner. Out of the 25,100 couples in Canada in 2001 which had one Japanese person, only 30% had two partners of Japanese descent and 70% included one non-Japanese partner. As of 2001, 65% of Canada's Japanese population was born in Canada.\n\n===Internment===\n{{Main|Japanese Canadian internment}}\nIn 1942, the [[Politics of Canada|federal government]] used the [[War Measures Act]] to brand Japanese Canadians enemy aliens and categorized them as security threats. There were 20,881 Japanese placed in internment camps and road camps in British Columbia; prison of war camps in Ontario; and families were also sent as forced labourers to farms throughout the prairies. Three-quarters of them were Canadian [technically British subjects, as were all Canadians, since [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian citizenship]] did not exist prior to 1947]. A parallel situation occurred in the United States. (See [[Japanese American internment]].)<ref>Ann Gomer Sunahara, ''The politics of racism: The uprooting of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War'' (James Lorimer & Co, 1981)</ref>\n\nThe property and homes of Japanese Canadians living in the province of British Columbia were seized and sold off without consent in 1943. The funds were used to pay for their internment. They also had to \"pay rent\" for living in the internment shacks they were assigned. In 1945, after the war, as part of the continued effort to remove all Japanese Canadians from British Columbia, Prime Minister MacKenzie King's cabinet used Orders-in-Council to extend the powers of the War Measures Act and Japanese Canadians give two \"options\": to either be relocated to another province, i.e. \"East of the Rockies\", or to go \"back\" to Japan (though most were born in Canada and had never been to Japan). After organized protests by against their treatment, they were finally given the right to vote in 1949. Mobility restrictions were lifted in 1949.)\n\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, documents on the Japanese Canadian internment were released, and redress was sought by the National Association of Japanese Canadians, an organization representing Japanese Canadians nationally that was headed by Art Miki from Winnipeg. In 1986, it was shown that Japanese Canadians lost $443 million during the internment. There were 63% of Canadians who supported redress and 45% who favoured individual compensation. On September 22, 1988, the National Association of Japanese Canadians succeeded in negotiating a redress settlement with the government at the time, under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]. The settlement included $21,000 for each individual directly affected, that was, by 1993, almost 18,000 survivors. The federal government also provided a community endowment fund to assist in rebuilding the community, which is run by the National Association of Japanese Canadians. In addition, to address the more systemic racism that led to the plan and later justifications of the effort to remove \"all people of Japanese racial origin\" from Canadian territory, the redress settlement included the establishment of the Race Relations Foundation and challenges to the War Measures Act. The Prime Minister also offered a formal apology in the House of Commons and the certificate of acknowledgement of injustices of the past, which was sent to each Japanese Canadian whose rights had been stripped, incarcerated, dispossessed and forcibly displaced.\n\n==Education==\n{{Location map+|Canada|width=300|float=right|caption=Locations of [[hosh\u016b jugy\u014d k\u014d]] in Canada|places=\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=43.653226|long=-79.383184299|mark = red pog.svg|marksize=5|link=Toronto Japanese School|label=<small>[[Toronto Japanese School|Toronto]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=49.2827291|long=-123.1207375|mark = blue pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Vancouver</small>|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=45.5016889|long=-73.56725599|mark = orange pog.svg|marksize=5|link=Montreal Hoshuko School|label=<small>[[Montreal Hoshuko School|Montreal]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=51.0486151|long=-114.0708459|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Calgary</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=53.544389|long=-113.490926699|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Edmonton</small>|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=44.6488625|long=-63.5753196|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Halifax</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=42.9849233|long=-81.2452768|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>London</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=45.4215296|long=-75.697193099|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Ottawa</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=52.1332144|long=-106.6700458|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Saskatoon</small>|position=right}}\n}}\n[[Hosh\u016b jugy\u014d k\u014d]] (Japanese supplementary schools) for instruction of the Japanese language include those in Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Vancouver.<ref name=NAList>\"[https://www.webcitation.org/6OSTGZpwz?url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/002/006/001/002/002.htm \u5317\u7c73\u306e\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821\u4e00\u89a7\uff08\u5e73\u621025\u5e744\u670815\u65e5\u73fe\u5728\uff09].\" () [[MEXT]].

Japanese Canadians are mostly concentrated in [[Western Canada]], especially in the province of [[British Columbia]], which hosts the largest Japanese community in the country with the majority of them living in and around [[Vancouver]]. In 2016, there were 121,485 Japanese Canadians throughout Canada.<ref name=\"Japanese Canadians\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=1&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105396&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=95&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF= |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |author=[[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Generations ==\nThe term [[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]] (\u65e5\u7cfb) was coined by sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations. Japanese descendants living overseas have special names for each of their generations. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numerals]] with the Japanese word for [[generation]] (''sei'' \u4e16):\n*[[Issei]] (\u4e00\u4e16) \u2013 The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before moving to Canada.\n*[[Nisei]] (\u4e8c\u4e16) \u2013 The second generation, born in Canada to Issei parents not born in Canada.\n*[[Sansei]] (\u4e09\u4e16) \u2013 The third generation, born in Canada to Nisei parents born in Canada.\n*[[Yonsei (Japanese diaspora)|Yonsei]] (\u56db\u4e16) \u2013 The fourth generation, born in Canada to Sansei parents born in Canada.\n*[[Gosei (Japanese diaspora)|Gosei]] (\u4e94\u4e16) \u2013 The fifth generation, born in Canada to Yonsei parents born in Canada.\n\n==History==\nThe first Japanese settler in Canada was [[Manzo Nagano]], who lived in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] in 1877 (a mountain in the province was named after him in 1977). The first generation, or [[Issei]], mostly came to [[Vancouver Island]], the [[Fraser Valley]] and [[Rivers Inlet]] from fishing villages on the islands of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and [[Honsh\u016b]] between 1877 and 1928. Since 1967, the second wave of immigrants were usually highly educated and resided in urban areas.<ref>Ken Adachi, ''The enemy that never was: A history of the Japanese Canadians'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1976)</ref>\n\nUntil 1948, Japanese-Canadians\u2014both ''Issei'' and Canadian-born ''Nisei''\u2014were denied the right to vote. Those born in the 1950s and 1960s in Canada are mostly [[Sansei]], third generation. Sansei usually have little knowledge of the [[Japanese language]]. Over 75% of the ''Sansei'' have married non-Japanese. ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generally do not identify themselves as fully Japanese,but as Canadians first, who happen to be of Japanese ancestry.\n\nThe younger generation of Japanese-Canadians born in the late 20th century are mostly ''Yonsei'', fourth generation. Many ''Yonsei'' are of mixed racial descent. According to [[Statistics Canada]]'s 2001 census of population information, Japanese-Canadians were the Canadian visible minority group most likely to marry or live common-law with a non-Japanese partner. Out of the 25,100 couples in Canada in 2001 which had one Japanese person, only 30% had two partners of Japanese descent and 70% included one non-Japanese partner. As of 2001, 65% of Canada's Japanese population was born in Canada.\n\n===Internment===\n{{Main|Japanese Canadian internment}}\nIn 1942, the [[Politics of Canada|federal government]] used the [[War Measures Act]] to brand Japanese Canadians enemy aliens and categorized them as security threats. There were 20,881 Japanese placed in internment camps and road camps in British Columbia; prison of war camps in Ontario; and families were also sent as forced labourers to farms throughout the prairies. Three-quarters of them were Canadian [technically British subjects, as were all Canadians, since [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian citizenship]] did not exist prior to 1947]. A parallel situation occurred in the United States. (See [[Japanese American internment]].)<ref>Ann Gomer Sunahara, ''The politics of racism: The uprooting of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War'' (James Lorimer & Co, 1981)</ref>\n\nThe property and homes of Japanese Canadians living in the province of British Columbia were seized and sold off without consent in 1943. The funds were used to pay for their internment. They also had to \"pay rent\" for living in the internment shacks they were assigned. In 1945, after the war, as part of the continued effort to remove all Japanese Canadians from British Columbia, Prime Minister MacKenzie King's cabinet used Orders-in-Council to extend the powers of the War Measures Act and Japanese Canadians give two \"options\": to either be relocated to another province, i.e. \"East of the Rockies\", or to go \"back\" to Japan (though most were born in Canada and had never been to Japan). After organized protests by against their treatment, they were finally given the right to vote in 1949. Mobility restrictions were lifted in 1949.)\n\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, documents on the Japanese Canadian internment were released, and redress was sought by the National Association of Japanese Canadians, an organization representing Japanese Canadians nationally that was headed by Art Miki from Winnipeg. In 1986, it was shown that Japanese Canadians lost $443 million during the internment. There were 63% of Canadians who supported redress and 45% who favoured individual compensation. On September 22, 1988, the National Association of Japanese Canadians succeeded in negotiating a redress settlement with the government at the time, under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]. The settlement included $21,000 for each individual directly affected, that was, by 1993, almost 18,000 survivors. The federal government also provided a community endowment fund to assist in rebuilding the community, which is run by the National Association of Japanese Canadians. In addition, to address the more systemic racism that led to the plan and later justifications of the effort to remove \"all people of Japanese racial origin\" from Canadian territory, the redress settlement included the establishment of the Race Relations Foundation and challenges to the War Measures Act. The Prime Minister also offered a formal apology in the House of Commons and the certificate of acknowledgement of injustices of the past, which was sent to each Japanese Canadian whose rights had been stripped, incarcerated, dispossessed and forcibly displaced.\n\n==Education==\n{{Location map+|Canada|width=300|float=right|caption=Locations of [[hosh\u016b jugy\u014d k\u014d]] in Canada|places=\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=43.653226|long=-79.383184299|mark = red pog.svg|marksize=5|link=Toronto Japanese School|label=<small>[[Toronto Japanese School|Toronto]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=49.2827291|long=-123.1207375|mark = blue pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Vancouver</small>|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=45.5016889|long=-73.56725599|mark = orange pog.svg|marksize=5|link=Montreal Hoshuko School|label=<small>[[Montreal Hoshuko School|Montreal]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=51.0486151|long=-114.0708459|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Calgary</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=53.544389|long=-113.490926699|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Edmonton</small>|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=44.6488625|long=-63.5753196|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Halifax</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=42.9849233|long=-81.2452768|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>London</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=45.4215296|long=-75.697193099|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Ottawa</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Canada|lat=52.1332144|long=-106.6700458|mark = green pog.svg|marksize=5|label=<small>Saskatoon</small>|position=right}}\n}}\n[[Hosh\u016b jugy\u014d k\u014d]] (Japanese supplementary schools) for instruction of the Japanese language include those in Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Vancouver.<ref name=NAList>\"[https://www.webcitation.org/6OSTGZpwz?url=http://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/clarinet/002/006/001/002/002.htm \u5317\u7c73\u306e\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821\u4e00\u89a7\uff08\u5e73\u621025\u5e744\u670815\u65e5\u73fe\u5728\uff09].\" () [[MEXT]].

He is the manager of the reserve team of [[Beijing Sinobo Guoan F.C.|Beijing Sinobo Guoan]] in China.\n\nMost of his professional career was spent at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (ten full seasons), appearing in more than 300 official matches with the club and winning nine major titles.\n\nMenzo represented the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] in one [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and one [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]].\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|Suriname]], Menzo arrived at [[Eredivisie]] giants [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] at the age of 19, from amateurs A.V.V. Zeeburgia.<ref>[http://www.zeeburgia.nl/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=891&Itemid=483 Oud-Zeeburgianen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070619191611/http://www.zeeburgia.nl/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=891&Itemid=483 |date=19 June 2007 }} {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nAfter two seasons deputising for [[Hans Galj\u00e9]], and a loan to fellow league side [[HFC Haarlem]], he became the starter for the [[Eredivisie 1985\u201386|1985\u201386 campaign]]. Newly appointed manager [[Johan Cruyff]] believed that Menzo was one of the first goalkeepers who could also make his mark as a field player.\n\nMenzo then proceeded to remain an undisputed starter for seven full seasons, helping Ajax to the [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390 national title]], as well as the [[1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]]. However, after a game in the latter competition [[1992\u201393 UEFA Cup|the following season]], a 2\u20134 loss at [[AJ Auxerre]], during which he scored an [[own goal]] and was also directly related to another, he lost his place to youth graduate [[Edwin van der Sar]], and never regained it.\n\nIn the 1994 summer, Menzo signed with [[PSV Eindhoven]], where he backed up [[Ronald Waterreus]] for two seasons. The 33-year-old managed to revive his career in [[Belgium]] with [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse SK]], which he helped win one [[Belgian Pro League|league]] and one [[Belgian Cup|cup]], eventually amassing nearly 100 official appearances. For a brief period of time, he also played in [[France]] for [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]], arriving in August 1997 to replace [[Gilbert Bodart]]. However, having lost his place to [[Ulrich Ram\u00e9]] (who would be the club's first-choice for more than one decade), he returned to Lierse, in January 1998.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, after a second spell at Ajax, Menzo joined amateur club [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]], helping it to the [[Hoofdklasse|amateur title]]. He retired from football at the end of the season.\n\n==International career==\nMenzo gained six [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]], the first arriving in 1989.

Newly appointed manager [[Johan Cruyff]] believed that Menzo was one of the first goalkeepers who could also make his mark as a field player.\n\nMenzo then proceeded to remain an undisputed starter for seven full seasons, helping Ajax to the [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390 national title]], as well as the [[1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]]. However, after a game in the latter competition [[1992\u201393 UEFA Cup|the following season]], a 2\u20134 loss at [[AJ Auxerre]], during which he scored an [[own goal]] and was also directly related to another, he lost his place to youth graduate [[Edwin van der Sar]], and never regained it.\n\nIn the 1994 summer, Menzo signed with [[PSV Eindhoven]], where he backed up [[Ronald Waterreus]] for two seasons. The 33-year-old managed to revive his career in [[Belgium]] with [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse SK]], which he helped win one [[Belgian Pro League|league]] and one [[Belgian Cup|cup]], eventually amassing nearly 100 official appearances. For a brief period of time, he also played in [[France]] for [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]], arriving in August 1997 to replace [[Gilbert Bodart]]. However, having lost his place to [[Ulrich Ram\u00e9]] (who would be the club's first-choice for more than one decade), he returned to Lierse, in January 1998.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, after a second spell at Ajax, Menzo joined amateur club [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]], helping it to the [[Hoofdklasse|amateur title]]. He retired from football at the end of the season.\n\n==International career==\nMenzo gained six [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]], the first arriving in 1989.

He was brought up in a very religious atmosphere, although his mother also had great respect for old Norse legends and traditions.

His lectures and the early poetry of [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger|Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] opened Grundtvig's eyes to the new era in literature.{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 35}}  His first work, ''On the Songs in the Edda'', attracted no attention.\n\nReturning to Copenhagen in 1808, Grundtvig achieved greater success with his ''Northern Mythology'', and again in 1809 with a long drama, ''The Fall of the Heroic Life in the North''.  Grundtvig boldly denounced the clergy of the city in his first sermon in 1810.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 33}}  When Grundtvig published the sermon three weeks later it offended the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities, and they demanded him punished.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 33}}{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 48}}\n\nIn 1810 Grundtvig underwent a religious crisis and converted to a strongly held [[Lutheranism]].  He retired to his father's country parish in Udby as his chaplain.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 33\u201336}}  His new-found conviction was expressed in his ''The First World Chronicle'' ({{lang|da|Kort Begreb af Verdens Kr\u00f8nike i Sammenh\u00e6ng}}) of 1812, a presentation of European history in which he attempted to explain how belief in God has been viewed throughout human history and in which he criticized the ideology of many prominent Danes.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 39}}{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 115\u2013117}}  It won him notoriety among his peers and cost him several friends, notably the historian [[Christian Molbech]].{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 115\u2013117}}  Upon his father's death in 1813, Grundtvig applied to be his successor in the parish but was rejected.<ref name=adlbio>{{Citation\n  | last         = Lundgreen-Nielsen\n  | first        = Flemming\n  | place        = [[Denmark|DK]]\n  | url          = http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&ff_id=31&p_fpkat_id=biog\n  | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703224821/http://adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&ff_id=31&p_fpkat_id=biog\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archive-date = 3 July 2007\n  | title        = NFS Grundtvig\n  | type         = Biografi\n  | language     = Danish\n  | publisher    = Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur\n  | accessdate   = 8 August 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years his rate of publication was staggering: aside from a continuing stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two more histories of the world (1814 and 1817); the long historical poem ''Roskilde-Riim'' (''Rhyme of Roskilde''; 1813); and a book-sized commentary, ''Roskilde Saga''.{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 125\u2013133}}  From 1816 to 1819 he was editor of and almost sole contributor to a philosophical and polemical journal entitled ''Danne-Virke'', which also published poetry.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 39}}\n\nFrom 1813 to 1815, he attempted to form a movement to support the [[Norwegians]] against the [[Swedish government]].  Later he preached on how the weakness of the Danish faith was the cause of the loss of [[Norway in 1814]].  His sermon was met by an enthusiastic congregation in Copenhagen.  Grundtvig withdrew from the pulpit because of lacking his own parish, and being barred by other churches.{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | pp = 55\u201357}}  In 1821 he resumed preaching briefly when granted the country living of [[Pr\u00e6st\u00f8]], and returned to the capital the year after.\n\n[[File:GrundtvigByHansen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|N. F. S. Grundtvig by [[Constantin Hansen]]]]\nIn 1825 Grundtvig published a pamphlet, ''The Church's Rejoinder'' ({{lang|da|Kirkens Gienm\u00e6le}}), a response to [[Henrik Nicolai Clausen]]'s work on the doctrines, rites and constitutions of [[Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].  A professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen, Clausen argued that although the Bible was the principal foundation of Christianity, it was in itself an inadequate expression of its full meaning.  He described the church as a \"community for the purpose of advancing general religiousness.\"{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 105}}  In his reply, Grundtvig denounced Clausen as an anti-Christian teacher and argued that Christianity was not a theory to be derived from the [[Holy Bible]] and elaborated by scholars.  He questioned the right of theologians to interpret the Bible.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 105\u2013106}}<ref>{{Citation\n  | last         = Grundtvig\n  | first        = Nikolaj Frederik Severin\n  | year         = 1825\n  | place        = DK\n  | url          = http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/pg/cv/AsciiPgVaerk2.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&p_udg_id=140&p_vaerk_id=12614\n  | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021920/http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/pg/cv/AsciiPgVaerk2.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&p_udg_id=140&p_vaerk_id=12614\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archive-date = 16 July 2011\n  | title        = Kirkens Gienm\u00e6le\n  | language     = Danish\n  | publisher    = Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur\n  | accessdate   = 9 August 2007\n}}</ref>  Grundtvig was publicly prosecuted for libel and fined.  The [[Church of Denmark]] forbade him to preach for seven years.  During this time he published a collection of theological works, visited [[England]] three times (1829\u201331), and studied [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]].<ref name=adlbio />\n\nIn 1832 Grundtvig obtained permission to again enter active ministry.  In 1839 he was called as pastor of the workhouse church of Vartov hospital in Copenhagen, a post he held until his death. Between 1837 and 1841 he published ''Sang-V\u00e6rk til den Danske Kirke'' (Song Work for the Danish Church), a rich collection of sacred poetry; in 1838 he brought out a selection of early Scandinavian verse; in 1840 he edited the Anglo-Saxon poem \"[[The Phoenix (Old English poem)|The Phoenix]]\", with a Danish translation.  In 1843 he visited England for a fourth time.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.grundtvig.dk/vartov/vartovs-historie.html\n  | title      = Vartovs historie\n  | publisher  = Grundtvig. dk\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.grundtvig.dk/files/manager/grundtvig-biblioteket/vartov-kirkes-bygningshistorie.pdf\n  | title      = Vartov kirkes bygningshistorie\n  | publisher  = Grundtvig. dk\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1844 until after the [[First Schleswig War]], Grundtvig took a prominent part in politics, developing from a conservative into an absolute liberal. In 1848 he was part of the [[Danish Constituent Assembly]] which wrote the first [[Constitution of Denmark|constitution of Denmark]] In 1861 he received the titular rank of Bishop in the [[Church of Denmark]], but without a [[Episcopal see|see]]. He continued to write and publish until his death. He spoke from the pulpit at Vartov Church every Sunday until a few days before his death.  His preaching attracted large congregations, and he soon had a following. His hymn book effected a great change in Danish church services, substituting the [[hymn]]s of the national poets for the slow measures of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]s.  In all Grundtvig wrote or translated about 1500 hymns, including \"[[God's Word Is Our Great Heritage]]\" and \"[[Det kimer nu til julefest]]\".\n\n== Christian thinking ==\nGrundtvig's theological development continued over his lifetime, and took a number of important turns.  He moved from his \"Christian awakening\" of 1810 to believing in a congregational and sacramental Christianity in later years. He was most notable for the latter thinking. He always called himself a pastor, not a theologian, reflecting the distance between his ideas and academic theology. The chief characteristic of his [[theology]] was the substitution of the authority of the \"living word\" for the apostolic commentaries.  He desired to see each congregation act as a practically independent community.\n\n== Thought on education ==\n[[File:Grundtvig Vartov Copenhagen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Sculpture of Grundtvig in Vartov  (Grundtvigsk Forum)  by [[Niels Skovgaard]]]]\n\nGrundtvig is the ideological father of the [[folk high school]], though his own ideas on education had another focus. He advocated reforming the ailing [[Sor\u00f8 Academy]] into a popular school aiming at another form of higher education than what was common at the university. Rather than educating learned scholars, he believed the university should educate its students for active participation in society and popular life. Thus practical skills as well as national poetry and history should form an essential part of the instruction.  This idea came very close to implementation during the reign of King [[Christian VIII]], whose wife [[Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Caroline Amalie]] was an ardent supporter of Grundtvig.  The death of the monarch in 1848 and the dramatic political development in Denmark during this and the following years put an end to these plans.  However, by that time,  one of Grundtvig's supporters, [[Kristen Kold]], had already established the first folk high school.\n\nGrundtvig's ambitions for school reform were not limited to the popular folk high school. He also dreamed of forming a Great Nordic University (the School for Passion) to be situated at the symbolic point of intersection between the three Scandinavian countries in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. The two pillars of his school program, the School for Life (folk high school) and the School for Passion (university) were aimed at quite different horizons of life. The popular education should mainly be taught within a national and patriotic horizon of understanding, yet always keeping an open mind towards a broader cultural and intercultural outlook, while the university should work from a strictly universal, i.e. humane and scientific, outlook.\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://samples.pubhub.dk/9788779340077.pdf\n  | title      = N.F.S.Grundtvig \u2013 A Life Recalled\n  | publisher  = University of Aarhus\n  | author     = S.A.J.Bradley\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nThe common denominator of all Grundtvig's [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] efforts was to promote a spirit of freedom, poetry and disciplined creativity, within all branches of educational life. He promoted values such as wisdom, compassion, identification and equality.  He opposed all compulsion, including exams, as deadening to the human soul.  Instead Grundtvig advocated unleashing human creativity according to the universally creative order of life. Only ''willing hands make light work''. Therefore, a spirit of freedom, cooperation and discovery was to be kindled in individuals, in science, and in the civil society as a whole.\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://infed.org/mobi/n-f-s-grundtvig-folk-high-schools-and-popular-education/\n  | title      = N.

III & IV : Po\u00ebma Danicum dialecto Anglosaxonica\n}} in a Latin translation.  Despite his lack of knowledge of [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], Grundtvig quickly discovered a number of flaws in Thorkelin's rendering of the poems.  After his heated debate with Thorkelin, Johan B\u00fclow (1751\u20131828), who had sponsored Thorkelin's work, offered to support a new translation by Grundtvig \u2014 this time into Danish. The result, Bjovulfs Drape (1820), was the first full translation of Beowulf into a modern language ([[Beowulf#Translations_and_adaptations|previously]], only selections of the poem had been translated into modern English by [[Sharon Turner]] in 1805).\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://runeberg.org/dbl/3/0293.html\n  | title      = Hofembedsmand \u2013 B\u00fclow, Johan, 1751\u20131828\t\n  | publisher  = \tDansk biografisk Lexikon\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nGrundtvig went on to explore the extensive literature of the Anglo-Saxons which survived in Old English and Latin.  In both poetry and prose, it revealed the spirituality of the early Church in [[Northern Europe]].  Grundtvig was very influenced by these ancient models of Christian and historical thought (notably the 8th-century Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', written in Latin).  Using the resources of the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] in Copenhagen and of the libraries at the universities of Exeter, Oxford and Cambridge in three successive summer visits to England (1829\u201331), he went on to make transcriptions of two of the four great codices of Anglo-Saxon poetry: the ''Exeter Book'' and the codex designated ''Junius 11'' in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford.  Although he thought to publish them, this project was never realized. ''Beowulf'' and Anglo-Saxon literature continued to be a major source of inspiration to Grundtvig.  It had a wide-ranging influence upon his work.<ref>{{Citation\n  | first   = SAJ\n  | last    = Bradley\n  | title   = Grundtvig, Bede and the Testimony of Antiquity\n  | journal = Grundtvig Studier\n  | year    = 2006\n  | pages   = 110\u2013131\n}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | first   = SAJ\n  | last    = Bradley\n  | title   = Before Irenaeus.

His first wife, Elisabeth Blicher (1787\u20131851), was a clergyman's daughter. They were married in 1818 and had three children. His second wife, Marie Toft (1813\u201354) was the daughter of a landowner. She died a few months after giving birth to a son. In 1858,  he married Asta Reedtz (1826\u20131890) of an old aristocratic Danish family. His son [[Svend Grundtvig]] (1824\u201383) collected and edited Danish ballads.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://adl.dk//adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=&ff_id=31&p_fpkat_id=biog\n  | title      = Biografi \u2013 Nik.

A three-volume edition in German, however, is under preparation and projects for an English edition are in progress as well. Grundtvig's secular poetical works were published in a nine-volume edition, the first seven volumes by his second son, the philologist [[Svend Grundtvig]]. The philological practice of this work, however, is not up to the standards of modern philology. His hymns have been collected in the philologically more stable five-volume edition ''Grundtvigs Sang-V\u00e6rk''.\n\nThe best overall collection of his writings is the 10 volume edition ''Grundtvigs udvalgte Skrifter'' edited by Holger Begtrup (1859\u20131937).

Grundtvig (1831 painting).jpg|thumb|upright|N. F. S. Grundtvig (1831)]]\nCalled Frederik rather than Nikolaj by those close to him, N. F. S. Grundtvig was the son of a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor, Johan Ottosen Grundtvig (1734\u20131813). He was brought up in a very religious atmosphere, although his mother also had great respect for old Norse legends and traditions. He was schooled in the tradition of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but his faith in reason was also influenced by German [[romanticism]] and the ancient history of the [[Nordic countries]].{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 30\u201331}}\n\nIn 1791 he was sent to Thyregod in [[Southern Jutland|Sydjylland]] to live and study with pastor Laurids Svindt Feld (1750\u20131803).  He subsequently studied at the [[Aarhus Katedralskole]], the [[cathedral school]] of [[Aarhus]], from 1798 until graduation. He left for [[Copenhagen]] in 1800 to study theology and was accepted to the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1801.{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 20\u201325}}{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 33}}  At the close of his university life, Grundtvig began to study [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the [[Icelandic Sagas]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.forfatterweb.dk/oversigt/grundtvig-n-f-s/zgrundtvig02\n  | title      = N.F.S.Grundtvig\n  | publisher  = Forfatterweb\n  | author     = Pia Andersen\n  | date       = 2005\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:N. F. S. Grundtvig by Vilhelm Bissen - DSC07150.JPG|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Grundtvig by [[Vilhelm Bissen]] at [[Frederik's Church]]]]\nIn 1805 Grundtvig took a position as tutor in a house on the island of [[Langeland]]. The next three years he used his free time to study writers [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]],  and [[Fichte]].{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 31\u201332}}  In 1802 his cousin, the philosopher [[Henrich Steffens]], returned to [[Copenhagen]] full of the teaching of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].  His lectures and the early poetry of [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger|Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] opened Grundtvig's eyes to the new era in literature.{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 35}}  His first work, ''On the Songs in the Edda'', attracted no attention.\n\nReturning to Copenhagen in 1808, Grundtvig achieved greater success with his ''Northern Mythology'', and again in 1809 with a long drama, ''The Fall of the Heroic Life in the North''.  Grundtvig boldly denounced the clergy of the city in his first sermon in 1810.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 33}}  When Grundtvig published the sermon three weeks later it offended the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities, and they demanded him punished.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 33}}{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | p = 48}}\n\nIn 1810 Grundtvig underwent a religious crisis and converted to a strongly held [[Lutheranism]].  He retired to his father's country parish in Udby as his chaplain.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 33\u201336}}  His new-found conviction was expressed in his ''The First World Chronicle'' ({{lang|da|Kort Begreb af Verdens Kr\u00f8nike i Sammenh\u00e6ng}}) of 1812, a presentation of European history in which he attempted to explain how belief in God has been viewed throughout human history and in which he criticized the ideology of many prominent Danes.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 39}}{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 115\u2013117}}  It won him notoriety among his peers and cost him several friends, notably the historian [[Christian Molbech]].{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 115\u2013117}}  Upon his father's death in 1813, Grundtvig applied to be his successor in the parish but was rejected.<ref name=adlbio>{{Citation\n  | last         = Lundgreen-Nielsen\n  | first        = Flemming\n  | place        = [[Denmark|DK]]\n  | url          = http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&ff_id=31&p_fpkat_id=biog\n  | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703224821/http://adl.dk/adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&ff_id=31&p_fpkat_id=biog\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archive-date = 3 July 2007\n  | title        = NFS Grundtvig\n  | type         = Biografi\n  | language     = Danish\n  | publisher    = Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur\n  | accessdate   = 8 August 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years his rate of publication was staggering: aside from a continuing stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two more histories of the world (1814 and 1817); the long historical poem ''Roskilde-Riim'' (''Rhyme of Roskilde''; 1813); and a book-sized commentary, ''Roskilde Saga''.{{Sfn | Abrahamowitz | 2000 | pp = 125\u2013133}}  From 1816 to 1819 he was editor of and almost sole contributor to a philosophical and polemical journal entitled ''Danne-Virke'', which also published poetry.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 39}}\n\nFrom 1813 to 1815, he attempted to form a movement to support the [[Norwegians]] against the [[Swedish government]].  Later he preached on how the weakness of the Danish faith was the cause of the loss of [[Norway in 1814]].  His sermon was met by an enthusiastic congregation in Copenhagen.  Grundtvig withdrew from the pulpit because of lacking his own parish, and being barred by other churches.{{Sfn | Reich | 2000 | pp = 55\u201357}}  In 1821 he resumed preaching briefly when granted the country living of [[Pr\u00e6st\u00f8]], and returned to the capital the year after.\n\n[[File:GrundtvigByHansen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|N. F. S. Grundtvig by [[Constantin Hansen]]]]\nIn 1825 Grundtvig published a pamphlet, ''The Church's Rejoinder'' ({{lang|da|Kirkens Gienm\u00e6le}}), a response to [[Henrik Nicolai Clausen]]'s work on the doctrines, rites and constitutions of [[Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].  A professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen, Clausen argued that although the Bible was the principal foundation of Christianity, it was in itself an inadequate expression of its full meaning.  He described the church as a \"community for the purpose of advancing general religiousness.\"{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | p = 105}}  In his reply, Grundtvig denounced Clausen as an anti-Christian teacher and argued that Christianity was not a theory to be derived from the [[Holy Bible]] and elaborated by scholars.  He questioned the right of theologians to interpret the Bible.{{Sfn | Allchin | 1997 | pp = 105\u2013106}}<ref>{{Citation\n  | last         = Grundtvig\n  | first        = Nikolaj Frederik Severin\n  | year         = 1825\n  | place        = DK\n  | url          = http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/pg/cv/AsciiPgVaerk2.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&p_udg_id=140&p_vaerk_id=12614\n  | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021920/http://www.adl.dk/adl_pub/pg/cv/AsciiPgVaerk2.xsql?nnoc=adl_pub&p_udg_id=140&p_vaerk_id=12614\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archive-date = 16 July 2011\n  | title        = Kirkens Gienm\u00e6le\n  | language     = Danish\n  | publisher    = Arkiv for Dansk Litteratur\n  | accessdate   = 9 August 2007\n}}</ref>  Grundtvig was publicly prosecuted for libel and fined.  The [[Church of Denmark]] forbade him to preach for seven years.  During this time he published a collection of theological works, visited [[England]] three times (1829\u201331), and studied [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]].<ref name=adlbio />\n\nIn 1832 Grundtvig obtained permission to again enter active ministry.  In 1839 he was called as pastor of the workhouse church of Vartov hospital in Copenhagen, a post he held until his death. Between 1837 and 1841 he published ''Sang-V\u00e6rk til den Danske Kirke'' (Song Work for the Danish Church), a rich collection of sacred poetry; in 1838 he brought out a selection of early Scandinavian verse; in 1840 he edited the Anglo-Saxon poem \"[[The Phoenix (Old English poem)|The Phoenix]]\", with a Danish translation.  In 1843 he visited England for a fourth time.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.grundtvig.dk/vartov/vartovs-historie.html\n  | title      = Vartovs historie\n  | publisher  = Grundtvig. dk\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://www.grundtvig.dk/files/manager/grundtvig-biblioteket/vartov-kirkes-bygningshistorie.pdf\n  | title      = Vartov kirkes bygningshistorie\n  | publisher  = Grundtvig. dk\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1844 until after the [[First Schleswig War]], Grundtvig took a prominent part in politics, developing from a conservative into an absolute liberal. In 1848 he was part of the [[Danish Constituent Assembly]] which wrote the first [[Constitution of Denmark|constitution of Denmark]] In 1861 he received the titular rank of Bishop in the [[Church of Denmark]], but without a [[Episcopal see|see]]. He continued to write and publish until his death. He spoke from the pulpit at Vartov Church every Sunday until a few days before his death.  His preaching attracted large congregations, and he soon had a following. His hymn book effected a great change in Danish church services, substituting the [[hymn]]s of the national poets for the slow measures of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]s.  In all Grundtvig wrote or translated about 1500 hymns, including \"[[God's Word Is Our Great Heritage]]\" and \"[[Det kimer nu til julefest]]\".\n\n== Christian thinking ==\nGrundtvig's theological development continued over his lifetime, and took a number of important turns.  He moved from his \"Christian awakening\" of 1810 to believing in a congregational and sacramental Christianity in later years. He was most notable for the latter thinking. He always called himself a pastor, not a theologian, reflecting the distance between his ideas and academic theology. The chief characteristic of his [[theology]] was the substitution of the authority of the \"living word\" for the apostolic commentaries.  He desired to see each congregation act as a practically independent community.\n\n== Thought on education ==\n[[File:Grundtvig Vartov Copenhagen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Sculpture of Grundtvig in Vartov  (Grundtvigsk Forum)  by [[Niels Skovgaard]]]]\n\nGrundtvig is the ideological father of the [[folk high school]], though his own ideas on education had another focus. He advocated reforming the ailing [[Sor\u00f8 Academy]] into a popular school aiming at another form of higher education than what was common at the university. Rather than educating learned scholars, he believed the university should educate its students for active participation in society and popular life. Thus practical skills as well as national poetry and history should form an essential part of the instruction.  This idea came very close to implementation during the reign of King [[Christian VIII]], whose wife [[Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|Caroline Amalie]] was an ardent supporter of Grundtvig.  The death of the monarch in 1848 and the dramatic political development in Denmark during this and the following years put an end to these plans.  However, by that time,  one of Grundtvig's supporters, [[Kristen Kold]], had already established the first folk high school.\n\nGrundtvig's ambitions for school reform were not limited to the popular folk high school. He also dreamed of forming a Great Nordic University (the School for Passion) to be situated at the symbolic point of intersection between the three Scandinavian countries in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. The two pillars of his school program, the School for Life (folk high school) and the School for Passion (university) were aimed at quite different horizons of life. The popular education should mainly be taught within a national and patriotic horizon of understanding, yet always keeping an open mind towards a broader cultural and intercultural outlook, while the university should work from a strictly universal, i.e. humane and scientific, outlook.\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://samples.pubhub.dk/9788779340077.pdf\n  | title      = N.F.S.Grundtvig \u2013 A Life Recalled\n  | publisher  = University of Aarhus\n  | author     = S.A.J.Bradley\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nThe common denominator of all Grundtvig's [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] efforts was to promote a spirit of freedom, poetry and disciplined creativity, within all branches of educational life. He promoted values such as wisdom, compassion, identification and equality.  He opposed all compulsion, including exams, as deadening to the human soul.  Instead Grundtvig advocated unleashing human creativity according to the universally creative order of life. Only ''willing hands make light work''. Therefore, a spirit of freedom, cooperation and discovery was to be kindled in individuals, in science, and in the civil society as a whole.\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://infed.org/mobi/n-f-s-grundtvig-folk-high-schools-and-popular-education/\n  | title      = N.

III & IV : Po\u00ebma Danicum dialecto Anglosaxonica\n}} in a Latin translation.  Despite his lack of knowledge of [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], Grundtvig quickly discovered a number of flaws in Thorkelin's rendering of the poems.  After his heated debate with Thorkelin, Johan B\u00fclow (1751\u20131828), who had sponsored Thorkelin's work, offered to support a new translation by Grundtvig \u2014 this time into Danish. The result, Bjovulfs Drape (1820), was the first full translation of Beowulf into a modern language ([[Beowulf#Translations_and_adaptations|previously]], only selections of the poem had been translated into modern English by [[Sharon Turner]] in 1805).\n<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://runeberg.org/dbl/3/0293.html\n  | title      = Hofembedsmand \u2013 B\u00fclow, Johan, 1751\u20131828\t\n  | publisher  = \tDansk biografisk Lexikon\n  | accessdate = 15 December 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nGrundtvig went on to explore the extensive literature of the Anglo-Saxons which survived in Old English and Latin.  In both poetry and prose, it revealed the spirituality of the early Church in [[Northern Europe]].  Grundtvig was very influenced by these ancient models of Christian and historical thought (notably the 8th-century Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', written in Latin).  Using the resources of the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] in Copenhagen and of the libraries at the universities of Exeter, Oxford and Cambridge in three successive summer visits to England (1829\u201331), he went on to make transcriptions of two of the four great codices of Anglo-Saxon poetry: the ''Exeter Book'' and the codex designated ''Junius 11'' in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford.  Although he thought to publish them, this project was never realized. ''Beowulf'' and Anglo-Saxon literature continued to be a major source of inspiration to Grundtvig.  It had a wide-ranging influence upon his work.<ref>{{Citation\n  | first   = SAJ\n  | last    = Bradley\n  | title   = Grundtvig, Bede and the Testimony of Antiquity\n  | journal = Grundtvig Studier\n  | year    = 2006\n  | pages   = 110\u2013131\n}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | first   = SAJ\n  | last    = Bradley\n  | title   = Before Irenaeus.

His second wife, Marie Toft (1813\u201354) was the daughter of a landowner. She died a few months after giving birth to a son. In 1858,  he married Asta Reedtz (1826\u20131890) of an old aristocratic Danish family. His son [[Svend Grundtvig]] (1824\u201383) collected and edited Danish ballads.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url        = http://adl.dk//adl_pub/fportraet/cv/ShowFpItem.xsql?nnoc=&ff_id=31&p_fpkat_id=biog\n  | title      = Biografi \u2013 Nik.

A three-volume edition in German, however, is under preparation and projects for an English edition are in progress as well. Grundtvig's secular poetical works were published in a nine-volume edition, the first seven volumes by his second son, the philologist [[Svend Grundtvig]]. The philological practice of this work, however, is not up to the standards of modern philology.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis.

In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Dieterich was employed as an organist, first in Helsingborg (1657\u20131658), and then at Helsing\u00f8r (1660\u20131668). St. Mary\u2019s in Helsing\u00f8r is the only church where Buxtehude was employed that still has the organ in its original location.\n\n===L\u00fcbeck: Marienkirche===\n[[File:Johann Philipp F\u00f6rtsch.jpg|thumb|Another person in the same Voorhout painting, once was thought to be Buxtehude.

Rochester: [[University of Rochester Press]], 2007), pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>]]\n\nBuxtehude's last post, from 1668, was at the [[St. Mary's Church, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]], [[L\u00fcbeck]] which had two organs, a large one for big services and a small one for devotionals and funerals. There he succeeded [[Franz Tunder]] and followed in many of the footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder's daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 \u2013 it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf's Church, his father joined the family in L\u00fcbeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music. Dieterich's brother Peter, a barber, joined them in 1677.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nHis post in the free Imperial city of L\u00fcbeck afforded him considerable latitude in his musical career, and his autonomy was a model for the careers of later Baroque masters such as [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. In 1673 he reorganized a series of evening musical performances, initiated by Tunder, known as ''[[Abendmusik]],'' which attracted musicians from diverse places and remained a feature of the church until 1810. In 1703, Handel and Mattheson both traveled to meet Buxtehude, who was by then elderly and ready to retire. He offered his position in L\u00fcbeck to Handel and Mattheson but stipulated that the organist who ascended to it must marry his eldest daughter, Anna Margareta. Both Handel and Mattheson turned the offer down<!--was it the daughter?--> and left the day after their arrival.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> In 1705, J.S. Bach, then a young man of twenty, walked from [[Arnstadt]] to L\u00fcbeck, a distance of more than {{convert|400|km}}, and stayed nearly three months to hear the ''Abendmusik,'' meet the pre-eminent L\u00fcbeck organist, hear him play, and, as Bach explained, \"to comprehend one thing and another about his art\".<ref>Christoph Wolff, ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, Inc., 2000), 96.</ref> In addition to his musical duties, Buxtehude, like his predecessor Tunder, served as church treasurer.\n\n===Influence and legacy===\nAlthough more than 100 vocal compositions by Buxtehude survive, very few of them were included in the important German manuscript collections of the period, and until the early twentieth century, Buxtehude was regarded primarily as a keyboard composer. His surviving church music is praised for its high musical qualities rather than its progressive elements<!--, which is similar to that of Bach's later church music.{{please clarify|reason=\"To what does 'which' refer?

North German Church Music in the Age of Buxtehude. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude}}\n\n===General introduction===\nThe bulk of Buxtehude's oeuvre consists of vocal music, which covers a wide variety of styles,<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Unfortunately, many of Buxtehude's compositions have been lost.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The [[libretto]]s for his [[oratorio]]s, for example, survive; but none of the scores do, which is particularly unfortunate, because his German oratorios seem to be the model for later works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. Further evidence of lost works by Buxtehude and his contemporaries can be found in the recently discovered catalogue of a 1695 music-auction in L\u00fcbeck.<ref>Stephen Rose, 'A L\u00fcbeck music auction, 1695', ''Sch\u00fctz-Jahrbuch'' 30 (2008), 171\u2013190.</ref>\n\n[[Gustaf D\u00fcben]]'s collection and the so-called L\u00fcbeck tablature A373 are the two most important sources for Buxtehude's vocal music. The former includes several autographs, both in German [[organ tablature]] and in score. Both collections were probably created during Buxtehude's lifetime and with his permission. Copies made by various composers are the only extant sources for the organ works: chorale settings are mostly transmitted in copies by [[Johann Gottfried Walther]], while Gottfried Lindemann's and others' copies concentrate on free works. [[Johann Christoph Bach]]'s manuscript is particularly important, as it includes the three known ostinato works and the famous Prelude and [[Chaconne]] in C major, [[List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude|BuxWV]] 137. Although Buxtehude himself most probably wrote in organ tablature, the majority of the copies are in standard staff notation.\n\n===Keyboard works===\n\n====Preludes and toccatas====\nThe nineteen organ ''praeludia'' (or ''preludes'') form the core of Buxtehude's work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint. They are usually either [[fugue]]s or pieces written in fugal manner; all make heavy use of pedal and are idiomatic to the organ. These preludes, together with pieces by [[Nicolaus Bruhns]], represent the highest point in the evolution of the [[German organ schools|north German organ prelude]], and the so-called ''[[stylus phantasticus]]''. They were undoubtedly among the influences of J.S. Bach, whose organ preludes, toccatas and fugues frequently employ similar techniques.<ref>While John Butt (''Cambridge Companion to Bach'', Cambridge UP, 1997, 110; books.google.com/books?id=MysXAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT110) believes the centrality of Buxtehude's on Bach's ''toccatas'', David Schulenberg emphasizes the influence of several composers. Schulenberg reserves the word \"especially\" for Johann Adam Reincken: \"Closer to a small group of north-German toccatas, especially one by Reincken [...] that resemble the early-Baroque type in being composed of distinct contrasting sections.\" Schulenberg, ''The Keyboard Music of J.S. Bach'' (NY: Routledge, 1992 [rev. ed., 2013]), 98.\n{{ISBN|9781136091544}}</ref>\n\nThe preludes are quite varied in style and structure, and are therefore hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The texture of Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia can be described as either free or fugal.<ref name=\"Archbald\">Archbald, Lawrence. Style and Structure in the Praeludia of Dietrich Buxtehude. Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1985.</ref> They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).\n\nThe introductory sections are always improvisatory. The preludes begin almost invariably with a single motif in one of the voices which is then treated imitatively for a bar or two. After this the introduction will most commonly elaborate on this motif or a part of it, or on a short melodic germ which is passed from voice to voice in three- or four-voice polyphonic writing, as seen in Example 1:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-145-intro.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 1''': This is the introduction from Prelude in F major, BuxWV 145. The motivic interaction seen here, in which a short motif is passing from one voice to another, sometimes sounding in two voices simultaneously, was frequently employed by Buxtehude in his preludes, frequently expanded to four voices with heavy use of pedal.]]\n\nOccasionally the introduction will engage in parallel 3rds, 6ths, etc. For example, BuxWV 149 begins with a single voice, proceeds to parallel counterpoint for nine bars and then segues into the kind of texture described above. The improvisatory interludes, free sections and postludes may all employ a vast array of techniques, from miscellaneous kinds of imitative writing (the technique discussed above, or \"fugues\" that dissolve into homophonic writing, etc.) to various forms of non-motivic interaction between voices (arpeggios, chordal style, figuration over [[pedal point]], etc.). [[Tempo]] marks are frequently present: ''Adagio'' sections written out in chords of whole- and half-notes, ''Vivace'' and ''Allegro'' imitative sections, and others.\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-fugue-subjects.gif|right|thumb|200px|'''Example 2''': Fugue subjects from BuxWV 137, BuxWV 140, BuxWV 142 (two) and BuxWV 153]]\n\nThe number of fugues in a prelude varies from one to three, not counting the pseudo-fugal free sections. The fugues normally employ four voices with extensive use of pedal. Most subjects are of medium length (see Example 2), frequently with some degree of repercussion (note repeating, particularly in BuxWV 148 and BuxWV 153), wide leaps or simplistic runs of 16th notes. One of the notable exceptions is a fugue in BuxWV 145, which features a six-bar subject. The answers are usually tonal, on scale degrees 1 and 5, and there is little real modulation. Stretto and parallel entries may be employed, with particular emphasis on the latter. Short and simple countersubjects appear, and may change their form slightly during the course of the fugue. In terms of structure, Buxtehude's fugues are a series of expositions, with non-thematic material appearing quite rarely, if ever. There is some variation, however, in the way they are constructed: in the first and last fugues of BuxWV 136 the second voice does not state the subject as it enters during the initial exposition; in BuxWV 153 the second exposition uses the subject in its inverted form, etc. Fugue subjects of a particular prelude may be related as in [[Froberger]]'s and [[Girolamo Frescobaldi|Frescobaldi]]'s [[ricercar]]s and [[canzona]]s (BuxWV 150, 152, etc.):\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-subjtrans.gif|center]]\n\nThe fugal procedure dissolves at the end of the fugue when it is followed by a free section, as seen in Example 4:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-140-bars39-42.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 4''': The dissolution of the fugue before a free section. The final entry of the subject (in the pedal) is joined by the highest voice engaging in a scale run.]]\n\nBuxtehude's other pieces that employ free writing or sectional structure include works titled ''toccata'', ''praeambulum'', etc.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> All are similar to the ''praeludia'' in terms of construction and techniques used, except that some of these works do not employ pedal passages or do so in a very basic way (pedal point which lasts during much of the piece, etc.). A well-known piece is BuxWV 146, in the rare key of F-sharp minor; it is believed that this prelude was written by Buxtehude especially for himself and his organ, and that he had his own way of tuning the instrument to allow for the tonality rarely used because of meantone temperament.\n\n====Chorale settings====\nThere are over 40 surviving chorale settings by Buxtehude, and they constitute the most important contributions to the genre in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> His settings include chorale variations, chorale ricercares, chorale fantasias and chorale preludes. Buxtehude's principal contributions to the organ chorale are his 30 short chorale preludes. The chorale preludes are usually four-part [[cantus firmus]] settings of one stanza of the chorale; the melody is presented in an elaborately ornamented version in the upper voice, the three lower parts engage in some form of counterpoint (not necessarily imitative). Most of Buxtehude's chorale settings are in this form.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Here is an example from chorale ''[[A Mighty Fortress is Our God|Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]'' BuxWV 184:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-chorale-ein-feste.png|center|thumb|810px|Opening bars of ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'' BuxWV 184. The ornamented chorale in the upper voice is highlighted, original melody for the two lines present here is shown on separate staves. Note the basic imitative lines in bars 6\u20138 and 13\u201315.]]\n\nThe ornamented cantus firmus in these pieces represents a significant difference between the [[German organ schools|north German and the south German schools]]; [[Johann Pachelbel]] and his pupils would almost always leave the chorale melody unornamented.\n\nThe chorale fantasias (a modern term) are large-scale virtuosic sectional compositions that cover a whole strophe of the text and are somewhat similar to chorale concertos in their treatment of the text: each verse is developed separately, allowing for technically and emotionally contrasting sections within one composition.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The presence of contrasting textures makes these pieces reminiscent of Buxtehude's ''praeludia''. Buxtehude was careful with correct word setting, paying particular attention to emphasis and interpretation.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Each section is also closely related to the text of the corresponding lines (chromatic sections to express sadness, gigue fugues to express joy, etc.). Examples include fantasias on the [hymn]s ''Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ'' BuxWV 188, ''{{lang|de|[[Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein]]}}'' BuxWV 210, ''Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren'' BuxWV 213 and ''[[Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern]]'', BuxWV 223.\n\nBuxtehude's chorale variations are usually in two or three voices. They consist of around 3\u20134 variations of which only one may use the pedal. These pieces are not as important for the development of the form and not as advanced as Pachelbel's or [[Georg B\u00f6hm|B\u00f6hm]]'s contributions to the genre. There are only a few chorale variations, and there are no distinctive qualities that characterize them.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nThe pieces that do not fall into any of the three types are ''Auf meinen lieben Gott'' BuxWV 179, which is, quite unusually for the time, a dance suite based on the chorale, and the ones based on the chant ([[Magnificat]]s BuxWV 203\u20135 and ''Te Deum laudamus'', BuxWV 218), which are structurally similar to chorale fantasias.\n\n====Ostinato works====\nThe three [[ostinato]] bass works Buxtehude composed\u2014two [[chaconne]]s (BuxWV 159\u2013160) and a [[passacaglia]] ([[Passacaglia in D minor, BuxWV 161|BuxWV 161]])\u2014not only represent, along with Pachelbel's six organ chaconnes, a shift from the traditional chaconne style, but are also the first truly developed north German contributions to the development of the genre.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> They are among Buxtehude's best-known works and have influenced numerous composers after him, most notably Bach (whose organ passacaglia is modeled after Buxtehude's) and [[Johannes Brahms]]. The pieces feature numerous connected sections, with many suspensions, changing meters, and even real modulation (in which the ostinato pattern is transposed into another key).\n\nSome of the [[Prelude (music)|praeludia]] also make use of ostinato models. The praeludium in C major, BuxWV 137, begins with a lengthy pedal solo and concludes not with a postlude of arpeggios and scale runs, but with a comparatively short chaconne built over a three-bar ostinato pattern in the pedal:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-137-ciacona.gif|center|720px]]\n\nThe praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 148, in which the ostinato pattern is derived from the subject of one of the fugal sections, also ends in a chaconne. In addition, another praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 149, employs a repeating bass pattern in the beginning.\n\n====Other keyboard works====\nThe rest of Buxtehude's keyboard music does not employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas are the only strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude's oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> There are also three pieces labelled ''fugues'': only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 is more of a canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more like a typical Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.\n\nThere are also 19 [[harpsichord]] suites and several variation sets. The suites follow the standard model (Allemande \u2013 Sarabande \u2013 Courante \u2013 Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande or a couple of doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French [[lute]] [[style bris\u00e9]], sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never go as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, [[Johann Mattheson]] mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.\n\nThe several sets of arias with variations are, surprisingly, much more developed than the organ chorale variations. BuxWV 250 ''La Capricciosa'' may have inspired Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' BWV 988: both have 32 variations (including the two arias of the Goldberg Variations); there are a number of similarities in the structure of individual movements; both include variations in forms of various dances; both are in G major; and Bach was familiar with Buxtehude's work and admired him, as has been related above.\n\n==Recordings==\n\n===Available media===\n{{listen\n | filename = BuxWV_104_-_Was_frag_ich_nach_der_Welt.ogg\n | title = ''Was frag ich nach der Welt'' (BuxWV 104)\n | description = Live recording (excerpt)\n | format = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2 = Buxtehude -- Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis).mid\n | title2 = ''Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis)''\n | description2 = Played with organ ([[MIDI]] file).\n | format2 = [[MIDI]]\n | filename3 = Wo ist doch.ogg\n | title3 = \"Dialogus inter Christum et fidelem animam\" \u2013 Wo ist doch mein freund geblieben?\n | description3 = A sacred cantata for soprano and bass.\n | format3 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename4 = Buxtehude - Toccata in F-Dur BuxWV 161.ogg\n | title4 = ''Toccata in F'' (BuxWV 161)\n | description4 = A toccata for organ.\n | format4 = [[Ogg]] \n | filename5 = BuxWV 12 - Cantate Domino.ogg\n | title5 = ''Cantate Domino'' (BuxWV 12)\n | description5 = Performed in 2005 by Bangkok Baroque Ensemble and Musica Ficta Bangkok\n | format5 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename6 = BuxWV160.ogg\n | title6 = Ciaconna in E-moll (BuxWV 160) \n | description6 = Performed on organ\n | format6 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n*Organ works\n**[[Lionel Rogg]] (EMI - 2-CD set; now only available as an mp3 download)\n**[[Simone Stella]] (Complete Organ Music \u2013 6-CD set), [[OnClassical]] (OC61-66B) 2012 also licensed for [[Brilliant Classics]] (BC 94422), 2012\n**[[Ulrik Spang-Hanssen]] (complete \u2013 recorded 1990/93)\n**[[Ren\u00e9 Saorgin]] (complete)\n**[[Michel Chapuis (organist)|Michel Chapuis]] (complete)\n**[[Peter Hurford]]\n**David Kinsela\n**[[Harald Vogel]] (complete - 7 CDs on the MD&G label)\n**[[Jean-Charles Ablitzer]] (complete - 5 CDs on the Harmonic Records label - recorded 1987-1989)\n**[[Ernst-Erich Stender]]\n**[[Bine Katrine Bryndorf]] (complete \u2013 6 CDs on the Da Capo label)\n**[[Walter Kraft]] (Complete \u2013 six CDs on the VoxBox label cd6x 3613 \u2013 recorded 1957, remastered 1999 \u2013 Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck)\n**[[Hans Davidsson]] (complete organ works \u2013 ''Volume 1: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/product_p/lrcd-1090-91.htm Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ], Loft Recordings</ref> ''Volume 2: The Bach Perspective'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_organ_works_Bach_Perspective_Davidsson_p/lrcd-1092-93.htm Dieterich Buxtehude: the Bach perspective], Loft Recordings</ref> and ''Volume 3: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ''<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_3_The_Schnitger_Organ_Davidsson_3_CDs_p/lrcd-1094-96.htm Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ], Loft Recordings</ref>)\n**[[Christopher Herrick]] (to be recorded from 2007)\n** [[Helga Schauerte-Maubouet]] : (Complete Organ Works), ''Syrius (SYR 141.347/348/359/366/371), 2000\u20132002'',\n**[[Ton Koopman]] (complete) \u2013 [[Dieterich Buxtehude \u2013 Opera Omnia]] series; Vol III, Organ works 1 (BuxWV 139, 141, 146, 156, 160, 162, 169, 178, 197, 210, 213, 220), Coci/Klapmeyer organ Altenbruch, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72242 \u2013 Vol IV, Organ works 2 (BuxWV 157, 161, 163, 164, 170, 173\u2013175, 177, 180\u2013182, 184, 188, 211, 217, 223), Wilde/Schnitger organ Ludingworth, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72243 \u2013 Vol VIII, Organ works 3 (BuxWV 149, 179, 225, 140, 185, 159, 148, 187, 176, 145, 183, 213\u20135, 137, 193, 200), Schnitger organ Hamburg, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72247 \u2013 Vol IX, Organ works 4 (BuxWV 138, 199, 172, 202, 224, 147, 196, 171, 219, 203, 144, 212, 201, 167, 186, 198, 190, 207, 189), Gerke/Herbst organ Basedow, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72248 \u2013 Vol X, Organ works 5 (BuxWV 142, 209, 218, 136, 222, 155, 221, 151, 152, 191, 158, 204, 205, 150, 153, 194, 192, 143, 206, 208 plus preludes in e (2) and G and a chorale prelude on \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" by Nicolaus Bruhns), Bielefeld organ Stade, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72249 (complete)\n**[[Bernard Foccroulle]] (complete) Ricercar RIC250.

Dieterich was employed as an organist, first in Helsingborg (1657\u20131658), and then at Helsing\u00f8r (1660\u20131668). St. Mary\u2019s in Helsing\u00f8r is the only church where Buxtehude was employed that still has the organ in its original location.\n\n===L\u00fcbeck: Marienkirche===\n[[File:Johann Philipp F\u00f6rtsch.jpg|thumb|Another person in the same Voorhout painting, once was thought to be Buxtehude.

Rochester: [[University of Rochester Press]], 2007), pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>]]\n\nBuxtehude's last post, from 1668, was at the [[St. Mary's Church, L\u00fcbeck|Marienkirche]], [[L\u00fcbeck]] which had two organs, a large one for big services and a small one for devotionals and funerals. There he succeeded [[Franz Tunder]] and followed in many of the footsteps of his predecessor. He married Tunder's daughter Anna Margarethe in 1668 \u2013 it was not uncommon practice that a man marry the daughter of his predecessor in his occupation. Buxtehude and Anna Margarethe had seven daughters who were baptized at the Marienkirche; however, his first daughter died as an infant. After his retirement as organist at St Olaf's Church, his father joined the family in L\u00fcbeck in 1673. Johannes died a year later, and Dieterich composed his funeral music. Dieterich's brother Peter, a barber, joined them in 1677.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nHis post in the free Imperial city of L\u00fcbeck afforded him considerable latitude in his musical career, and his autonomy was a model for the careers of later Baroque masters such as [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. In 1673 he reorganized a series of evening musical performances, initiated by Tunder, known as ''[[Abendmusik]],'' which attracted musicians from diverse places and remained a feature of the church until 1810. In 1703, Handel and Mattheson both traveled to meet Buxtehude, who was by then elderly and ready to retire. He offered his position in L\u00fcbeck to Handel and Mattheson but stipulated that the organist who ascended to it must marry his eldest daughter, Anna Margareta. Both Handel and Mattheson turned the offer down<!--was it the daughter?--> and left the day after their arrival.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> In 1705, J.S. Bach, then a young man of twenty, walked from [[Arnstadt]] to L\u00fcbeck, a distance of more than {{convert|400|km}}, and stayed nearly three months to hear the ''Abendmusik,'' meet the pre-eminent L\u00fcbeck organist, hear him play, and, as Bach explained, \"to comprehend one thing and another about his art\".<ref>Christoph Wolff, ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician'' (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, Inc., 2000), 96.</ref> In addition to his musical duties, Buxtehude, like his predecessor Tunder, served as church treasurer.\n\n===Influence and legacy===\nAlthough more than 100 vocal compositions by Buxtehude survive, very few of them were included in the important German manuscript collections of the period, and until the early twentieth century, Buxtehude was regarded primarily as a keyboard composer. His surviving church music is praised for its high musical qualities rather than its progressive elements<!--, which is similar to that of Bach's later church music.{{please clarify|reason=\"To what does 'which' refer?

North German Church Music in the Age of Buxtehude. New York: Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude}}\n\n===General introduction===\nThe bulk of Buxtehude's oeuvre consists of vocal music, which covers a wide variety of styles,<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> and organ works, which concentrate mostly on chorale settings and large-scale sectional forms. Chamber music constitutes a minor part of the surviving output, although the only chamber works Buxtehude published during his lifetime were fourteen chamber sonatas. Unfortunately, many of Buxtehude's compositions have been lost.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The [[libretto]]s for his [[oratorio]]s, for example, survive; but none of the scores do, which is particularly unfortunate, because his German oratorios seem to be the model for later works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]. Further evidence of lost works by Buxtehude and his contemporaries can be found in the recently discovered catalogue of a 1695 music-auction in L\u00fcbeck.<ref>Stephen Rose, 'A L\u00fcbeck music auction, 1695', ''Sch\u00fctz-Jahrbuch'' 30 (2008), 171\u2013190.</ref>\n\n[[Gustaf D\u00fcben]]'s collection and the so-called L\u00fcbeck tablature A373 are the two most important sources for Buxtehude's vocal music. The former includes several autographs, both in German [[organ tablature]] and in score. Both collections were probably created during Buxtehude's lifetime and with his permission. Copies made by various composers are the only extant sources for the organ works: chorale settings are mostly transmitted in copies by [[Johann Gottfried Walther]], while Gottfried Lindemann's and others' copies concentrate on free works. [[Johann Christoph Bach]]'s manuscript is particularly important, as it includes the three known ostinato works and the famous Prelude and [[Chaconne]] in C major, [[List of compositions by Dieterich Buxtehude|BuxWV]] 137. Although Buxtehude himself most probably wrote in organ tablature, the majority of the copies are in standard staff notation.\n\n===Keyboard works===\n\n====Preludes and toccatas====\nThe nineteen organ ''praeludia'' (or ''preludes'') form the core of Buxtehude's work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint. They are usually either [[fugue]]s or pieces written in fugal manner; all make heavy use of pedal and are idiomatic to the organ. These preludes, together with pieces by [[Nicolaus Bruhns]], represent the highest point in the evolution of the [[German organ schools|north German organ prelude]], and the so-called ''[[stylus phantasticus]]''. They were undoubtedly among the influences of J.S. Bach, whose organ preludes, toccatas and fugues frequently employ similar techniques.<ref>While John Butt (''Cambridge Companion to Bach'', Cambridge UP, 1997, 110; books.google.com/books?id=MysXAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT110) believes the centrality of Buxtehude's on Bach's ''toccatas'', David Schulenberg emphasizes the influence of several composers. Schulenberg reserves the word \"especially\" for Johann Adam Reincken: \"Closer to a small group of north-German toccatas, especially one by Reincken [...] that resemble the early-Baroque type in being composed of distinct contrasting sections.\" Schulenberg, ''The Keyboard Music of J.S. Bach'' (NY: Routledge, 1992 [rev. ed., 2013]), 98.\n{{ISBN|9781136091544}}</ref>\n\nThe preludes are quite varied in style and structure, and are therefore hard to categorize, as no two praeludia are alike.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The texture of Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia can be described as either free or fugal.<ref name=\"Archbald\">Archbald, Lawrence. Style and Structure in the Praeludia of Dietrich Buxtehude. Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1985.</ref> They consist of strict diatonic harmony and secondary dominants.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> Structure-wise, there usually is an introductory section, a fugue and a postlude, but this basic scheme is very frequently expanded: both BuxWV 137 and BuxWV 148 include a full-fledged chaconne along with fugal and toccata-like writing in other sections, BuxWV 141 includes two fugues, sections of imitative counterpoint and parts with chordal writing. Buxtehude\u2019s praeludia are not circular, nor is there a recapitulation. A fugal theme, when it recurs, does so in a new, changed way.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> A few pieces are smaller in scope; for example, BuxWV 144, which consists only of a brief improvisatory prelude followed by a longer fugue. The sections may be explicitly separated in the score or flow one into another, with one ending and the other beginning in the same bar. The texture is almost always at least three-voice, with many instances of four-voice polyphony and occasional sections in five voices (BuxWV 150 being one of the notable examples, with five-voice structure in which two of the voices are taken by the pedal).\n\nThe introductory sections are always improvisatory. The preludes begin almost invariably with a single motif in one of the voices which is then treated imitatively for a bar or two. After this the introduction will most commonly elaborate on this motif or a part of it, or on a short melodic germ which is passed from voice to voice in three- or four-voice polyphonic writing, as seen in Example 1:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-145-intro.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 1''': This is the introduction from Prelude in F major, BuxWV 145. The motivic interaction seen here, in which a short motif is passing from one voice to another, sometimes sounding in two voices simultaneously, was frequently employed by Buxtehude in his preludes, frequently expanded to four voices with heavy use of pedal.]]\n\nOccasionally the introduction will engage in parallel 3rds, 6ths, etc. For example, BuxWV 149 begins with a single voice, proceeds to parallel counterpoint for nine bars and then segues into the kind of texture described above. The improvisatory interludes, free sections and postludes may all employ a vast array of techniques, from miscellaneous kinds of imitative writing (the technique discussed above, or \"fugues\" that dissolve into homophonic writing, etc.) to various forms of non-motivic interaction between voices (arpeggios, chordal style, figuration over [[pedal point]], etc.). [[Tempo]] marks are frequently present: ''Adagio'' sections written out in chords of whole- and half-notes, ''Vivace'' and ''Allegro'' imitative sections, and others.\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-fugue-subjects.gif|right|thumb|200px|'''Example 2''': Fugue subjects from BuxWV 137, BuxWV 140, BuxWV 142 (two) and BuxWV 153]]\n\nThe number of fugues in a prelude varies from one to three, not counting the pseudo-fugal free sections. The fugues normally employ four voices with extensive use of pedal. Most subjects are of medium length (see Example 2), frequently with some degree of repercussion (note repeating, particularly in BuxWV 148 and BuxWV 153), wide leaps or simplistic runs of 16th notes. One of the notable exceptions is a fugue in BuxWV 145, which features a six-bar subject. The answers are usually tonal, on scale degrees 1 and 5, and there is little real modulation. Stretto and parallel entries may be employed, with particular emphasis on the latter. Short and simple countersubjects appear, and may change their form slightly during the course of the fugue. In terms of structure, Buxtehude's fugues are a series of expositions, with non-thematic material appearing quite rarely, if ever. There is some variation, however, in the way they are constructed: in the first and last fugues of BuxWV 136 the second voice does not state the subject as it enters during the initial exposition; in BuxWV 153 the second exposition uses the subject in its inverted form, etc. Fugue subjects of a particular prelude may be related as in [[Froberger]]'s and [[Girolamo Frescobaldi|Frescobaldi]]'s [[ricercar]]s and [[canzona]]s (BuxWV 150, 152, etc.):\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-subjtrans.gif|center]]\n\nThe fugal procedure dissolves at the end of the fugue when it is followed by a free section, as seen in Example 4:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-140-bars39-42.gif|center|thumb|810px|'''Example 4''': The dissolution of the fugue before a free section. The final entry of the subject (in the pedal) is joined by the highest voice engaging in a scale run.]]\n\nBuxtehude's other pieces that employ free writing or sectional structure include works titled ''toccata'', ''praeambulum'', etc.<ref name=\"Archbald\"/> All are similar to the ''praeludia'' in terms of construction and techniques used, except that some of these works do not employ pedal passages or do so in a very basic way (pedal point which lasts during much of the piece, etc.). A well-known piece is BuxWV 146, in the rare key of F-sharp minor; it is believed that this prelude was written by Buxtehude especially for himself and his organ, and that he had his own way of tuning the instrument to allow for the tonality rarely used because of meantone temperament.\n\n====Chorale settings====\nThere are over 40 surviving chorale settings by Buxtehude, and they constitute the most important contributions to the genre in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> His settings include chorale variations, chorale ricercares, chorale fantasias and chorale preludes. Buxtehude's principal contributions to the organ chorale are his 30 short chorale preludes. The chorale preludes are usually four-part [[cantus firmus]] settings of one stanza of the chorale; the melody is presented in an elaborately ornamented version in the upper voice, the three lower parts engage in some form of counterpoint (not necessarily imitative). Most of Buxtehude's chorale settings are in this form.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Here is an example from chorale ''[[A Mighty Fortress is Our God|Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott]]'' BuxWV 184:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-chorale-ein-feste.png|center|thumb|810px|Opening bars of ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'' BuxWV 184. The ornamented chorale in the upper voice is highlighted, original melody for the two lines present here is shown on separate staves. Note the basic imitative lines in bars 6\u20138 and 13\u201315.]]\n\nThe ornamented cantus firmus in these pieces represents a significant difference between the [[German organ schools|north German and the south German schools]]; [[Johann Pachelbel]] and his pupils would almost always leave the chorale melody unornamented.\n\nThe chorale fantasias (a modern term) are large-scale virtuosic sectional compositions that cover a whole strophe of the text and are somewhat similar to chorale concertos in their treatment of the text: each verse is developed separately, allowing for technically and emotionally contrasting sections within one composition.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> The presence of contrasting textures makes these pieces reminiscent of Buxtehude's ''praeludia''. Buxtehude was careful with correct word setting, paying particular attention to emphasis and interpretation.<ref name=\"Webber\"/> Each section is also closely related to the text of the corresponding lines (chromatic sections to express sadness, gigue fugues to express joy, etc.). Examples include fantasias on the [hymn]s ''Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ'' BuxWV 188, ''{{lang|de|[[Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein]]}}'' BuxWV 210, ''Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren'' BuxWV 213 and ''[[Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern]]'', BuxWV 223.\n\nBuxtehude's chorale variations are usually in two or three voices. They consist of around 3\u20134 variations of which only one may use the pedal. These pieces are not as important for the development of the form and not as advanced as Pachelbel's or [[Georg B\u00f6hm|B\u00f6hm]]'s contributions to the genre. There are only a few chorale variations, and there are no distinctive qualities that characterize them.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/>\n\nThe pieces that do not fall into any of the three types are ''Auf meinen lieben Gott'' BuxWV 179, which is, quite unusually for the time, a dance suite based on the chorale, and the ones based on the chant ([[Magnificat]]s BuxWV 203\u20135 and ''Te Deum laudamus'', BuxWV 218), which are structurally similar to chorale fantasias.\n\n====Ostinato works====\nThe three [[ostinato]] bass works Buxtehude composed\u2014two [[chaconne]]s (BuxWV 159\u2013160) and a [[passacaglia]] ([[Passacaglia in D minor, BuxWV 161|BuxWV 161]])\u2014not only represent, along with Pachelbel's six organ chaconnes, a shift from the traditional chaconne style, but are also the first truly developed north German contributions to the development of the genre.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> They are among Buxtehude's best-known works and have influenced numerous composers after him, most notably Bach (whose organ passacaglia is modeled after Buxtehude's) and [[Johannes Brahms]]. The pieces feature numerous connected sections, with many suspensions, changing meters, and even real modulation (in which the ostinato pattern is transposed into another key).\n\nSome of the [[Prelude (music)|praeludia]] also make use of ostinato models. The praeludium in C major, BuxWV 137, begins with a lengthy pedal solo and concludes not with a postlude of arpeggios and scale runs, but with a comparatively short chaconne built over a three-bar ostinato pattern in the pedal:\n\n[[File:Buxtehude-137-ciacona.gif|center|720px]]\n\nThe praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 148, in which the ostinato pattern is derived from the subject of one of the fugal sections, also ends in a chaconne. In addition, another praeludium in G minor, BuxWV 149, employs a repeating bass pattern in the beginning.\n\n====Other keyboard works====\nThe rest of Buxtehude's keyboard music does not employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas are the only strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude's oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind.<ref name=\"Snyder\"/> There are also three pieces labelled ''fugues'': only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 is more of a canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more like a typical Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.\n\nThere are also 19 [[harpsichord]] suites and several variation sets. The suites follow the standard model (Allemande \u2013 Sarabande \u2013 Courante \u2013 Gigue), sometimes excluding a movement and sometimes adding a second sarabande or a couple of doubles. Like Froberger's, all dances except the gigues employ the French [[lute]] [[style bris\u00e9]], sarabandes and courantes frequently being variations on the allemande. The gigues employ basic imitative counterpoint but never go as far as the gigue fugues in the chorale fantasias or the fugal writing seen in organ preludes. It may be that the more developed harpsichord writing by Buxtehude simply did not survive: in his writings, [[Johann Mattheson]] mentioned a cycle of seven suites by Buxtehude, depicting the nature of planets, but these pieces are lost.\n\nThe several sets of arias with variations are, surprisingly, much more developed than the organ chorale variations. BuxWV 250 ''La Capricciosa'' may have inspired Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' BWV 988: both have 32 variations (including the two arias of the Goldberg Variations); there are a number of similarities in the structure of individual movements; both include variations in forms of various dances; both are in G major; and Bach was familiar with Buxtehude's work and admired him, as has been related above.\n\n==Recordings==\n\n===Available media===\n{{listen\n | filename = BuxWV_104_-_Was_frag_ich_nach_der_Welt.ogg\n | title = ''Was frag ich nach der Welt'' (BuxWV 104)\n | description = Live recording (excerpt)\n | format = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2 = Buxtehude -- Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis).mid\n | title2 = ''Variations on an Aria by Lully (Rofilis)''\n | description2 = Played with organ ([[MIDI]] file).\n | format2 = [[MIDI]]\n | filename3 = Wo ist doch.ogg\n | title3 = \"Dialogus inter Christum et fidelem animam\" \u2013 Wo ist doch mein freund geblieben?\n | description3 = A sacred cantata for soprano and bass.\n | format3 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename4 = Buxtehude - Toccata in F-Dur BuxWV 161.ogg\n | title4 = ''Toccata in F'' (BuxWV 161)\n | description4 = A toccata for organ.\n | format4 = [[Ogg]] \n | filename5 = BuxWV 12 - Cantate Domino.ogg\n | title5 = ''Cantate Domino'' (BuxWV 12)\n | description5 = Performed in 2005 by Bangkok Baroque Ensemble and Musica Ficta Bangkok\n | format5 = [[Ogg]]\n | filename6 = BuxWV160.ogg\n | title6 = Ciaconna in E-moll (BuxWV 160) \n | description6 = Performed on organ\n | format6 = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n*Organ works\n**[[Lionel Rogg]] (EMI - 2-CD set; now only available as an mp3 download)\n**[[Simone Stella]] (Complete Organ Music \u2013 6-CD set), [[OnClassical]] (OC61-66B) 2012 also licensed for [[Brilliant Classics]] (BC 94422), 2012\n**[[Ulrik Spang-Hanssen]] (complete \u2013 recorded 1990/93)\n**[[Ren\u00e9 Saorgin]] (complete)\n**[[Michel Chapuis (organist)|Michel Chapuis]] (complete)\n**[[Peter Hurford]]\n**David Kinsela\n**[[Harald Vogel]] (complete - 7 CDs on the MD&G label)\n**[[Jean-Charles Ablitzer]] (complete - 5 CDs on the Harmonic Records label - recorded 1987-1989)\n**[[Ernst-Erich Stender]]\n**[[Bine Katrine Bryndorf]] (complete \u2013 6 CDs on the Da Capo label)\n**[[Walter Kraft]] (Complete \u2013 six CDs on the VoxBox label cd6x 3613 \u2013 recorded 1957, remastered 1999 \u2013 Marienkirche, L\u00fcbeck)\n**[[Hans Davidsson]] (complete organ works \u2013 ''Volume 1: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/product_p/lrcd-1090-91.htm Dieterich Buxtehude and the Mean-Tone Organ], Loft Recordings</ref> ''Volume 2: The Bach Perspective'',<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_organ_works_Bach_Perspective_Davidsson_p/lrcd-1092-93.htm Dieterich Buxtehude: the Bach perspective], Loft Recordings</ref> and ''Volume 3: Dieterich Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ''<ref>[http://www.gothic-catalog.com/Buxtehude_3_The_Schnitger_Organ_Davidsson_3_CDs_p/lrcd-1094-96.htm Buxtehude and the Schnitger Organ], Loft Recordings</ref>)\n**[[Christopher Herrick]] (to be recorded from 2007)\n** [[Helga Schauerte-Maubouet]] : (Complete Organ Works), ''Syrius (SYR 141.347/348/359/366/371), 2000\u20132002'',\n**[[Ton Koopman]] (complete) \u2013 [[Dieterich Buxtehude \u2013 Opera Omnia]] series; Vol III, Organ works 1 (BuxWV 139, 141, 146, 156, 160, 162, 169, 178, 197, 210, 213, 220), Coci/Klapmeyer organ Altenbruch, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72242 \u2013 Vol IV, Organ works 2 (BuxWV 157, 161, 163, 164, 170, 173\u2013175, 177, 180\u2013182, 184, 188, 211, 217, 223), Wilde/Schnitger organ Ludingworth, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72243 \u2013 Vol VIII, Organ works 3 (BuxWV 149, 179, 225, 140, 185, 159, 148, 187, 176, 145, 183, 213\u20135, 137, 193, 200), Schnitger organ Hamburg, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72247 \u2013 Vol IX, Organ works 4 (BuxWV 138, 199, 172, 202, 224, 147, 196, 171, 219, 203, 144, 212, 201, 167, 186, 198, 190, 207, 189), Gerke/Herbst organ Basedow, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72248 \u2013 Vol X, Organ works 5 (BuxWV 142, 209, 218, 136, 222, 155, 221, 151, 152, 191, 158, 204, 205, 150, 153, 194, 192, 143, 206, 208 plus preludes in e (2) and G and a chorale prelude on \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" by Nicolaus Bruhns), Bielefeld organ Stade, Antoine Marchand Records, CC72249 (complete)\n**[[Bernard Foccroulle]] (complete) Ricercar RIC250.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions. By 1967, Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered neogtiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title=Samuel Gelfman letter to The New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)#Adaptations|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]] and eventually passing to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, Guillermo Del Toro was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. Time constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions. By 1967, Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered neogtiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title=Samuel Gelfman letter to The New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)#Adaptations|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]] and eventually passing to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).
