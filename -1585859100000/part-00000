Rieg\u00e9 informed Bl\u00e9fari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Rieg\u00e9, Rieg\u00e9 would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included\n{{ quote\n| text= drug traffickers, drug addicts, prostitutes, exploiters, pimps, nightclubs, discos, motels }}\nSince the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.\n<ref name=\"matar\">\n{{cite web\n| title= Matar para robar, luchar para vivir\n| url= http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/investig/frade04/frade04_04.htm\n| url-status= live\n| access-date= 2017-08-18\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170628153929/http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/investig/frade04/frade04_04.htm\n| archive-date= 2017-06-28\n}}</ref> \n\nAs part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.\n\nAnother complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried.<ref name=\"redes\"/> For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= Our colleagues, who are human beings and have feelings, fall in love with the police and pimps.<ref name=\"miedo\"/>\n| author= Elena Reynaga }}\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/>\n\nOn March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludue\u00f1a neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with \"a humiliating treatment\". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want \"male or female prostitutes\" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nAs leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= We are asking for security. We are fed up with being presented to the merchants of the neighborhoods as sources of insecurity, when many times the presence of prostitutes has avoided robberies.\n\nWe know that we are at fault and do not refuse to be delayed by the police in routine checks, but most of us have school-age children and we have already talked to government ministry personnel so we will not be detained in days during the school year, in order to send our children to school.\n\nThese things are repeated every time there are changes of leadership in the sections.

An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended,<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything.<ref name=\"olor\"/> Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.\n<ref name=\"marcha\">\n{{ cite news\n |title        = Masiva marcha pidi\u00f3 que se aclare el crimen de Sandra\n |url          = http://www.ellitoral.com/accesorios/imprimir.php?id=/diarios/2004/02/06/sucesos/SUCE-02.html\n |url-status     = live\n |date         = 2004-02-06\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170815161454/http://www.ellitoral.com/accesorios/imprimir.php?id=%2Fdiarios%2F2004%2F02%2F06%2Fsucesos%2FSUCE-02.html\n |archive-date = 2017-08-15\n}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/> \n\nOn October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said \"Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow.\" The girl was Cabrera's eight-year-old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nA few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that \"Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school.\" A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nOn October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nAt some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.<ref name=\"aUnAno\"/>\n\nThe last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/>\n\nDuring her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.<ref name=\"redes\"/>\n\n== Murder ==\n{{ quote \n| text= The testimony of the comrades and the prostitutes may not have had the weight that was expected.

Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/>\n\nThe forensic report concluded:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= The possibility is raised of a killer who has chosen circumstances of time and place, has killed at the right moment of least resistance of the victim, has held the corpse so that it does not strike with suddenness when falling and has left without leaving evidence of his presence. The hypothesis speaks of a professional profile of the victimizer with knowledge in the area, the habits of the victim and the task to be performed. Likewise the neatness of their movements must be considered. This consideration offers the probable alternative that the assailant knew the victim during a previous encounter provoked precisely to obtain data of habits and circumstances in which the victim moved.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/> }}\n\n=== Reaction ===\nHer murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.\n<ref name=\"disuelven\">\n{{cite news \n| title= Disuelven la divisi\u00f3n Moralidad de la Polic\u00eda\n| url= https://www.clarin.com/policiales/disuelven-division-moralidad-policia_0_BJizGHAyRKg.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2004-01-30\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170811233621/https://www.clarin.com/policiales/disuelven-division-moralidad-policia_0_BJizGHAyRKg.html\n| archive-date= 2017-08-11\n }}</ref>\n\nThe investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes.

Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers,<ref name=\"luchadora\"/> i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel.

At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted \"We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police.\"<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/>\n\nAmong political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> Carlos del Frade relates that during [[Jorge Obeid | Obeid]]'s first administration as governor of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]], he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nThe previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high-ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/>\n\nTo show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen-year-old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extrajudicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] and the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] association of prosecutors demanded his removal.<ref name=\"zorro\"/>\n\nAfter several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder.<ref name=\"redes\"/> In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.\n<ref name=\"estructural\">\n{{cite news \n| title= Una impunidad estructural\n| url= http://boletin.enredando.org.ar/imprimir.shtml?AA_SL_Session=24ef123c70339a022caa748293587a23&sh_itm=25da05375696bda66988dcb24694f439&add_disc=1\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2008-10-30\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170828170250/http://boletin.enredando.org.ar/imprimir.shtml?AA_SL_Session=24ef123c70339a022caa748293587a23&sh_itm=25da05375696bda66988dcb24694f439&add_disc=1\n| archive-date= 2017-08-28\n }}</ref> \nOn appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder.<ref name=\"redes\"/> The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as \"\"people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary\".<ref name=\"miedo\"/> One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who \"have an activity that can not be described as good morals,\" according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade.<ref name=\"estructural\"/> He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n\nAmong the members of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Argentina | Rosario]] chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. \"If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs,\" they told each other, and \"She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues.\"<ref name=\"explotadores\"/> But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, \"Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra.\"<ref name=\"miedo\"/> A lawyer who worked for [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]], the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left [[Santa Fe province]] out of fear.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/> Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= Fear is present.

To myself they say \"How do you keep going\"?<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero}}\n\nAs for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Influence ===\n==== Public Morality police unit ====\nIf the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= ... because it is an obsolete unit that allows a certain degree of corruption, without passing judgment on the officers that served in it.\n| author= Alberto Gianneschi, Minister of Government in Santa Fe province at the time of Sandra Cabrera's murder\n}}\n\nBut he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.\n<ref name=\"noticia\">\n{{cite press release\n |title        = Noticia del jueves 29 de enero de 2004\n |url          = http://gobierno.santafe.gov.ar/prensa/mitemplate.php?idnoticia=18447&mostrarmenu=si&include=noticias_prensa/2004/290104r3.htm&ptitulo=Noticia%20del%20jueves%2029%20de%20enero%20de%202004%20(290104r3.htm)&fechanoticia=&volverurl=&pDescDiaMax=Lunes&intvalDi\n |url-status     = live\n |date         = 2004-01-29\n |archive-url  = https://www.webcitation.org/6sfcJYF0T?url=http://gobierno.santafe.gov.ar/prensa/mitemplate.php?idnoticia=18447&mostrarmenu=si&include=noticias_prensa%2F2004%2F290104r3.htm&ptitulo=Noticia%20del%20jueves%2029%20de%20enero%20de%202004%20%28290104r3.htm%29&fechanoticia=&volverurl=&pDescDiaMax=Lunes&intvalDi\n |archive-date = 2017-08-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Misdemeanor Code ====\nOn the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church.<ref name=\"explotadores\"/> As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= We are looking for a balance between the claims of the defense of modesty and scandalous prostitution through a new bill.\n| author= Alberto Gianneschi<ref name=\"noticia\"/>\n}}\n\nAs the new secretary general of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= \"The contravention codes are not repealed. The situation is the same, the only thing that changed is that there is no more Public Morality, but there are the precincts, there is the command [police unit], the police are still chasing us. After Sandra's death, a month later, we had a partner in Baigorria who was threatened and beaten. The harassment continues, the mobile units stop us, some police come and say 'you have to go because the neighbor says' and that is a lie. They make it up so that the sex worker gives them money and they let her work. The commands are in the red zone and that's because the codes are not repealed and the police still have power.<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero }}\n\nFor AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= I said when Sandra passed, let's try to continue because otherwise everything is dying. And that is the commitment and at the same time persuades me that the death of Sandra was not in vain, beyond that we do not have justice.

The day that the codes are repealed will not be our achievement, that's the way Sandra prepared us, so the achievement will be hers.<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero }}\n\nFinally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.\n<ref name=\"despenalizo\">\n{{cite news \n| title= Santa Fe despenaliz\u00f3 la prostituci\u00f3n y el travestismo\n| url= http://www.diariojudicial.com/nota/25632\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2010-07-23\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170813002127/http://www.diariojudicial.com/nota/25632\n| archive-date= 2017-08-13\n }}</ref> \nWhile she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.\n\n==== Rosario ====\nWalter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]]. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that \"There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police.\" AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.\n<ref name=\"abusos\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Rosario: abusos, trata, droga y complicidades\n| url= http://www.plazademayo.com/2012/11/rosario-abusos-trata-droga-y-complicidades\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2012-11-01\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170823034011/http://www.plazademayo.com/2012/11/rosario-abusos-trata-droga-y-complicidades\n| archive-date= 2017-08-23\n }}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= \"I had to go and talk to the commissioner of the 7th precinct, after a worker was detained in the terminal area and extorted by the police.\n<ref name=\"proyecto\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Meretrices con nuevo proyecto\n| url= https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-27128-2011-01-24.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2011-01-24\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160414003514/http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-27128-2011-01-24.html\n| archive-date= 2016-04-14\n }}</ref>\n| author= Claudia Lucero\n}}\n\nShortly thereafter, sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.\n<ref name=\"prost\u00edbulo\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Un prost\u00edbulo, a todas luces\n| url= https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-37782-2013-02-23.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2013-02-23\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160413065957/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-37782-2013-02-23.html\n| archive-date= 2016-04-13\n }}</ref> \n\nSome of the women who had worked in the cabarets and ''whisker\u00edas'' that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.\n<ref name=\"sombra\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Prostituci\u00f3n en la sombra: c\u00f3mo se ejerce hoy la actividad en Rosario\n| url= http://www.rosarioplus.com/ensacoycorbata/Prostitucion-en-la-sombra-como-se-ejerce-hoy-la-actividad-en-Rosario--20170529-0043.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2017-05-30\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010221/http://www.rosarioplus.com/ensacoycorbata/Prostitucion-en-la-sombra-como-se-ejerce-hoy-la-actividad-en-Rosario--20170529-0043.html\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n }}</ref> \nThe motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized ''casitas'', where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that \"It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place.\"<ref name=\"sombra\"/>\n\nFor the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.\n\n{{ quote\n| text=  We suffer more searches, more humiliation, more payment of fines and the difficulty of making use of the street. Lately, there are reports that the police drive the girls away, beat them, do not let them work, ask them for sexual favors and ask for money.<ref name=\"sombra\"/>\n| author= Georgina Orellano\n}}\n\nOrellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.<ref name=\"sombra\"/>\n\nThe legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as \"scandalous\" and an \"offense to modesty\"<ref name=\"proyecto\"/> now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= A short while ago the Command [Radio Command, a police unit] wanted to take bribes from a member [of AMMAR], and it turns out that she is unionized. She told them to take her prisoner, but she would call her lawyer as soon as she got to the police station because she had that right. The cops wanted to arrange something, give them money, or go to jail. But when she told them that, they dropped her at a corner and left.<ref name=\"frente\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero\n}}\n\n=== Recognition ===\nNine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Salta province]], demanding justice and sex workers rights.

Rieg\u00e9 informed Bl\u00e9fari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Rieg\u00e9, Rieg\u00e9 would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included\n{{ quote\n| text= drug traffickers, drug addicts, prostitutes, exploiters, pimps, nightclubs, discos, motels }}\nSince the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.\n<ref name=\"matar\">\n{{cite web\n| title= Matar para robar, luchar para vivir\n| url= http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/investig/frade04/frade04_04.htm\n| url-status= live\n| access-date= 2017-08-18\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170628153929/http://www.desaparecidos.org/nuncamas/web/investig/frade04/frade04_04.htm\n| archive-date= 2017-06-28\n}}</ref> \n\nAs part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.\n\nAnother complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried.<ref name=\"redes\"/> For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= Our colleagues, who are human beings and have feelings, fall in love with the police and pimps.<ref name=\"miedo\"/>\n| author= Elena Reynaga }}\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/>\n\nOn March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludue\u00f1a neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with \"a humiliating treatment\". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want \"male or female prostitutes\" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nAs leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= We are asking for security. We are fed up with being presented to the merchants of the neighborhoods as sources of insecurity, when many times the presence of prostitutes has avoided robberies.\n\nWe know that we are at fault and do not refuse to be delayed by the police in routine checks, but most of us have school-age children and we have already talked to government ministry personnel so we will not be detained in days during the school year, in order to send our children to school.\n\nThese things are repeated every time there are changes of leadership in the sections.

An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended,<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything.<ref name=\"olor\"/> Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.\n<ref name=\"marcha\">\n{{ cite news\n |title        = Masiva marcha pidi\u00f3 que se aclare el crimen de Sandra\n |url          = http://www.ellitoral.com/accesorios/imprimir.php?id=/diarios/2004/02/06/sucesos/SUCE-02.html\n |url-status     = live\n |date         = 2004-02-06\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170815161454/http://www.ellitoral.com/accesorios/imprimir.php?id=%2Fdiarios%2F2004%2F02%2F06%2Fsucesos%2FSUCE-02.html\n |archive-date = 2017-08-15\n}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police.

From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nA few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that \"Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school.\" A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nOn October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nAt some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.<ref name=\"aUnAno\"/>\n\nThe last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media.

Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/>\n\nThe forensic report concluded:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= The possibility is raised of a killer who has chosen circumstances of time and place, has killed at the right moment of least resistance of the victim, has held the corpse so that it does not strike with suddenness when falling and has left without leaving evidence of his presence. The hypothesis speaks of a professional profile of the victimizer with knowledge in the area, the habits of the victim and the task to be performed. Likewise the neatness of their movements must be considered. This consideration offers the probable alternative that the assailant knew the victim during a previous encounter provoked precisely to obtain data of habits and circumstances in which the victim moved.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/> }}\n\n=== Reaction ===\nHer murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.\n<ref name=\"disuelven\">\n{{cite news \n| title= Disuelven la divisi\u00f3n Moralidad de la Polic\u00eda\n| url= https://www.clarin.com/policiales/disuelven-division-moralidad-policia_0_BJizGHAyRKg.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2004-01-30\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170811233621/https://www.clarin.com/policiales/disuelven-division-moralidad-policia_0_BJizGHAyRKg.html\n| archive-date= 2017-08-11\n }}</ref>\n\nThe investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers,<ref name=\"luchadora\"/> i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years.\n\nEveryone else assumed it was the police.

At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted \"We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police.\"<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/>\n\nAmong political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/> Carlos del Frade relates that during [[Jorge Obeid | Obeid]]'s first administration as governor of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]], he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.<ref name=\"matar\"/>\n\nThe previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.<ref name=\"niUnaMas\"/>\n\nTo show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen year old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] and the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] association of prosecutors demanded his removal.<ref name=\"zorro\"/>\n\nAfter several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder.<ref name=\"redes\"/> In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.\n<ref name=\"estructural\">\n{{cite news \n| title= Una impunidad estructural\n| url= http://boletin.enredando.org.ar/imprimir.shtml?AA_SL_Session=24ef123c70339a022caa748293587a23&sh_itm=25da05375696bda66988dcb24694f439&add_disc=1\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2008-10-30\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170828170250/http://boletin.enredando.org.ar/imprimir.shtml?AA_SL_Session=24ef123c70339a022caa748293587a23&sh_itm=25da05375696bda66988dcb24694f439&add_disc=1\n| archive-date= 2017-08-28\n }}</ref> \nOn appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder.<ref name=\"redes\"/> The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as \"\"people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary\".<ref name=\"miedo\"/> One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who \"have an activity that can not be described as good morals,\" according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade.<ref name=\"estructural\"/> He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n\nAmong the members of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Argentina | Rosario]] chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. \"If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs,\" they told each other, and \"She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues.\"<ref name=\"explotadores\"/> But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, \"Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra.\"<ref name=\"miedo\"/> A lawyer who worked for [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]], the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left [[Santa Fe province]] out of fear.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/> Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= Fear is present. When I tell you, let's get together, come, they're afraid. I can not tell them we are going to a march or when we are going to do some research work as well. To myself they say \"How do you keep going\"?<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero}}\n\nAs for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.<ref name=\"impunidad\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Influence ===\n==== Public Morality police unit ====\nIf the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= ... because it is an obsolete unit that allows a certain degree of corruption, without passing judgment on the officers that served in it.\n| author= Alberto Gianneschi, Minister of Government in Santa Fe province at the time of Sandra Cabrera's murder\n}}\n\nBut he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.\n<ref name=\"noticia\">\n{{cite press release\n |title        = Noticia del jueves 29 de enero de 2004\n |url          = http://gobierno.santafe.gov.ar/prensa/mitemplate.php?idnoticia=18447&mostrarmenu=si&include=noticias_prensa/2004/290104r3.htm&ptitulo=Noticia%20del%20jueves%2029%20de%20enero%20de%202004%20(290104r3.htm)&fechanoticia=&volverurl=&pDescDiaMax=Lunes&intvalDi\n |url-status     = live\n |date         = 2004-01-29\n |archive-url  = https://www.webcitation.org/6sfcJYF0T?url=http://gobierno.santafe.gov.ar/prensa/mitemplate.php?idnoticia=18447&mostrarmenu=si&include=noticias_prensa%2F2004%2F290104r3.htm&ptitulo=Noticia%20del%20jueves%2029%20de%20enero%20de%202004%20%28290104r3.htm%29&fechanoticia=&volverurl=&pDescDiaMax=Lunes&intvalDi\n |archive-date = 2017-08-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Misdemeanor Code ====\nOn the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church.<ref name=\"explotadores\"/> As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= We are looking for a balance between the claims of the defense of modesty and scandalous prostitution through a new bill.\n| author= Alberto Gianneschi<ref name=\"noticia\"/>\n}}\n\nAs the new secretary general of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= \"The contravention codes are not repealed. The situation is the same, the only thing that changed is that there is no more Public Morality, but there are the precincts, there is the command [police unit], the police are still chasing us. After Sandra's death, a month later, we had a partner in Baigorria who was threatened and beaten. The harassment continues, the mobile units stop us, some police come and say 'you have to go because the neighbor says' and that is a lie. They make it up so that the sex worker gives them money and they let her work. The commands are in the red zone and that's because the codes are not repealed and the police still have power.<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero }}\n\nFor AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= I said when Sandra passed, let's try to continue because otherwise everything is dying. And that is the commitment and at the same time persuades me that the death of Sandra was not in vain, beyond that we do not have justice.

The day that the codes are repealed will not be our achievement, that's the way Sandra prepared us, so the achievement will be hers.<ref name=\"estructural\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero }}\n\nFinally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.\n<ref name=\"despenalizo\">\n{{cite news \n| title= Santa Fe despenaliz\u00f3 la prostituci\u00f3n y el travestismo\n| url= http://www.diariojudicial.com/nota/25632\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2010-07-23\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170813002127/http://www.diariojudicial.com/nota/25632\n| archive-date= 2017-08-13\n }}</ref> \nWhile she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.\n\n==== Rosario ====\nWalter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]]. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that \"There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police.\" AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.\n<ref name=\"abusos\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Rosario: abusos, trata, droga y complicidades\n| url= http://www.plazademayo.com/2012/11/rosario-abusos-trata-droga-y-complicidades\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2012-11-01\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170823034011/http://www.plazademayo.com/2012/11/rosario-abusos-trata-droga-y-complicidades\n| archive-date= 2017-08-23\n }}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.\n\n{{ quote\n| text= \"I had to go and talk to the commissioner of the 7th precinct, after a worker was detained in the terminal area and extorted by the police.\n<ref name=\"proyecto\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Meretrices con nuevo proyecto\n| url= https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-27128-2011-01-24.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2011-01-24\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160414003514/http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-27128-2011-01-24.html\n| archive-date= 2016-04-14\n }}</ref>\n| author= Claudia Lucero\n}}\n\nShortly thereafter, sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.\n<ref name=\"prost\u00edbulo\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Un prost\u00edbulo, a todas luces\n| url= https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-37782-2013-02-23.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2013-02-23\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160413065957/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/rosario/9-37782-2013-02-23.html\n| archive-date= 2016-04-13\n }}</ref> \n\nSome of the women who had worked in the cabarets and ''whisker\u00edas'' that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.\n<ref name=\"sombra\">\n{{cite news\n| title= Prostituci\u00f3n en la sombra: c\u00f3mo se ejerce hoy la actividad en Rosario\n| url= http://www.rosarioplus.com/ensacoycorbata/Prostitucion-en-la-sombra-como-se-ejerce-hoy-la-actividad-en-Rosario--20170529-0043.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2017-05-30\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830010221/http://www.rosarioplus.com/ensacoycorbata/Prostitucion-en-la-sombra-como-se-ejerce-hoy-la-actividad-en-Rosario--20170529-0043.html\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n }}</ref> \nThe motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized ''casitas'', where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that \"It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place.\"<ref name=\"sombra\"/>\n\nFor the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.\n\n{{ quote\n| text=  We suffer more searches, more humiliation, more payment of fines and the difficulty of making use of the street. Lately, there are reports that the police drive the girls away, beat them, do not let them work, ask them for sexual favors and ask for money.<ref name=\"sombra\"/>\n| author= Georgina Orellano\n}}\n\nOrellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.<ref name=\"sombra\"/>\n\nThe legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as \"scandalous\" and an \"offense to modesty\"<ref name=\"proyecto\"/> now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:\n\n{{ quote\n| text= A short while ago the Command [Radio Command, a police unit] wanted to take bribes from a member [of AMMAR], and it turns out that she is unionized. She told them to take her prisoner, but she would call her lawyer as soon as she got to the police station because she had that right. The cops wanted to arrange something, give them money, or go to jail. But when she told them that, they dropped her at a corner and left.<ref name=\"frente\"/>\n| author= Claudia Lucero\n}}\n\n=== Recognition ===\nNine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Salta province]], demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] march was described as \"multitudinous\" and included a cross section of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups.\n<ref name=\"pedido\">\n{{ cite news\n| title= Pedido de justicia por el crimen de Sandra\n| url= https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-31182-2004-02-06.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2004-02-06\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830185454/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-31182-2004-02-06.html\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n}}</ref> \nAnother march in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] a month later was described in the same terms and included the same civic groups.\n<ref name=\"unMes\">\n{{ cite news\n| title= MULTITUDINARIA MARCHA A UN MES DEL ASESINATO DE SANDRA CABRERA\n| url= http://notife.com/14984-multitudinaria-marcha-a-un-mes-del-asesinato-de-sandra-cabrera\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2004-02-28\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830185311/http://notife.com/14984-multitudinaria-marcha-a-un-mes-del-asesinato-de-sandra-cabrera\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n}}</ref> \nThese marches have been repeated over the years on the anniversary of her murder, up to the present.\n<ref name=\"marcha2005\">\n{{ cite news\n| title= Marcha a un a\u00f1o del asesinato de Sandra Cabrera\n| url= http://argentina.indymedia.org/news/2005/01/260269_comment.php\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2005-01-29\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830190216/http://argentina.indymedia.org/news/2005/01/260269_comment.php\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"marcha2007\">\n{{ cite news\n| title= Recuerdan a Sandra Cabrera\n| url= http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/18950-\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2007-01-26\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830190711/http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/18950-\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"marcha2015\">\n{{ cite news\n| title= Una marcha para recordar a Sandra Cabrera\n| url= http://www.rosarioplus.com/noticias/Una-marcha-para-recordar-a-Sandra-Cabrera-20150126-0051.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2015-01-27\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170830190940/http://www.rosarioplus.com/noticias/Una-marcha-para-recordar-a-Sandra-Cabrera-20150126-0051.html\n| archive-date= 2017-08-30\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 the director Lucrecia Mastrangelo released a film titled, ''Sex, dignity and death: Sandra Cabrera, unpunished crime''.<ref name=ammar>[http://www.redtrasex.org/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=568 AMMAR remembered Sandra Cabrera], 6 June 2012, redtrasex.org, Retrieved 2 September 2016</ref>\n\nIn 2017, a small public square in the area around the bus terminal where she had worked was named in her honor.\n<ref name=\"plazoleta\">\n{{cite news\n| title= A 13 a\u00f1os de su crimen, inauguran la plazoleta Sandra Cabrera\n| url= http://www.rosario3.com/noticias/A-13-anos-de-su-crimen-inauguran-la-plazoleta-Sandra-Cabrera-20170126-0031.html\n| url-status= live\n| date= 2017-01-26\n| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170126153707/https://www.rosario3.com/noticias/A-13-anos-de-su-crimen-inauguran-la-plazoleta-Sandra-Cabrera-20170126-0031.html\n| archive-date= 2017-01-26\n }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cabrera, Sandra}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from San Juan, Argentina]]\n[[Category:Argentine trade unionists]]\n[[Category:Argentine women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Sex worker activists in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Sex workers' rights]]\n[[Category:Violence against women in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Police misconduct in Argentina]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: eight year old daughter \u2192 eight-year-old daughter (2), high ranking officers \u2192 high-ranking officers, extra-judicial \u2192 extrajudicial", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Cabrera"}

The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, which were created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, or NFFA for short, as an act desperation after an economic collapse and recession, however, in the installment [[The First Purge]], it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s intent with the holiday, is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge, depicts a trial run of the Purge in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released. The first Purge film, [[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] takes places after The Purge has gone nation-wide. The next Purge film in the timeline, and the second to be released, was [[The Purge: Anarchy]] which depicts the purge being turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves. The third installment, and final installment in regards the Purge timeline, is [[The Purge: Election Year]]. In Election Year, a presidential candidate, who is a senator during the beginning of the film, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on purge night. The Purge featured in Election Year, was the first one were politicians were not immune, which was an attempt by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going. The [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]], never reveals where it fits in the timeline of the films and was a complete [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] not in line with any of the films.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]] and Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier and James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''Untitled Purge Sequel''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}*\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller and Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n{{small|*Expected release date.

The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next twelve hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget.

This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21, 2017 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, 2017 wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Class 1-4\" weaponry are permitted for use while \"Class 5\" weaponry (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, bazookas, etc., weapons of mass destruction, and viral/biological and chemical agents) is prohibited.\n\nBelow is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28th Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The First Purge]]'', taking place in 2017 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]], which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, one year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event was ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n* A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n* A {{note label|Voice|V}} indicates the actor or actress lent only their voice for their character.\n* A dark gray cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!

The films present a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period.  \n\nThe franchise began in 2013 with ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]'', directed by the franchise creator DeMonaco, who also directed two of the sequels and wrote the screenplays for all, including the yet-unnamed Purge 5 which, he has hinted in interviews, could be the end of the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/05/13/purge-5-release-date/|title='The Purge 5' to be released next year|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> In addition to films, the franchise has spawned [[The Purge (TV series)|a television series]] which premiered on September 4, 2018; DeMonaco wrote its pilot episode.   \n\nThe franchise has received a generally mixed critical reception, mainly for the screenwriting and clich\u00e9d stories, but was praised for the concept, acting, style and action sequences. The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, which were created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, or NFFA for short, as an act desperation after an economic collapse and recession, however, in the installment [[The First Purge]], it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s intent with the holiday, is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge, depicts a trial run of the Purge in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released. The first Purge film, [[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] takes places after The Purge has gone nation-wide. The next Purge film in the timeline, and the second to be released, was [[The Purge: Anarchy]] which depicts the purge being turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves. The third installment, and final installment in regards the Purge timeline, is [[The Purge: Election Year]]. In Election Year, a presidential candidate, who is a senator during the beginning of the film, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on purge night. The Purge featured in Election Year, was the first one were politicians were not immune, which was an attempt by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going. The [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]], never reveals where it fits in the timeline of the films and was a complete [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] not in line with any of the films.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]] and Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier and James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''Untitled Purge Sequel''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}*\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller and Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n{{small|*Expected release date.

The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next twelve hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget.

In a bid to prevent this from happening, The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) takes the unprecedented step of abolishing the protection afforded to government officials of ranking 10, allowing the U.S. public to target all government officials for the first time since the purge's creation. After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. Meanwhile, NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and went on to gross over $118 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the series.\n\n===''The First Purge'' (2018)===\n{{main|The First Purge}}\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21, 2017 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, 2017 wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Class 1-4\" weaponry are permitted for use while \"Class 5\" weaponry (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, bazookas, etc., weapons of mass destruction, and viral/biological and chemical agents) is prohibited.\n* Public hanging is the penalty for violators of any rules.\n\nBelow is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28th Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The First Purge]]'', taking place in 2017 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]], which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, one year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event was ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n* A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n* A {{note label|Voice|V}} indicates the actor or actress lent only their voice for their character.\n* A dark gray cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!

This type of prostitution is organised by closed networks, and is subject to very few controls. In some cases, the sexual contact between these adolescents and their clients takes place at the client's house. Adolescents from all parts of the country prostitute themselves in local bars or pubs, mainly for middle-class clients.
