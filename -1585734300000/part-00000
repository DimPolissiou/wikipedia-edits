Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialisation of conventional units.\n\n==History==\n\nThe name \u201cJagdkommando\u201d has its origins in the time of [[World War I]], when small assault squads of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian K.u.K. Army]] were called what translates to \u201cmanhunt command.\u201d\n\nThe history of the Austrian Special Operations Forces began in 1961, when a group of Austrian officers participated in the [[US Army]]'s [[Ranger School]] as part of their training in order to set up a similar course for the eventual establishment of Jagdkommando. Since then, the officers and soldiers of Jagdkommando have continued to evolve by taking part in similar courses in the [[United States]] and all over [[Europe]] and by combining the lessons learned with \"homegrown\" tactics and knowledge. The unit has earned the respect of other nations' special forces very quickly. The headquarters of the Jagdkommando is located in [[Wiener Neustadt]].\n\nMost of the missions are classified, but the Jagdkommando usually operates in places where regular Austrian troops are also located - such as the [[Balkans]] ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], etc.), [[Afghanistan]] ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], until 2005) and [[Chad]] ([[EUFOR Tchad/RCA]], since 2008). In the east of Chad about 50 Jagdkommando soldiers are deployed to protect refugee camps near the border to [[Darfur]] from early 2008 on.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/tschad.htm 2007 - Jagdkommando prepares for Tchad Mission]</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Jagdkommando are equipped with the VT Hunter OTV as part of preparations to intervene in Mali.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160617142346/http://www.janes.com/article/61468/jagdkommando-readies-vt-hunter-otv-for-possible-west-african-operations</ref> They would be deployed with [[French Armed Forces|French troops]] under [[Operation Barkhane]].<ref>https://www.sofx.com/2016/06/25/austrian-special-forces-prepare-deployment-mali-defenceweb/</ref>\n\n===Current structure===\n*Headquarters\n**1st Special Operations Task Group\n**2nd Special Operations Task Group\n**3rd Special Operations Task Group (''Reserve'')\n\n==Selection and training==\n[[File:Jagdkommando Fallschirmspringer.jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando airborne operations]]\n\nSelection is usually held once a year and has a duration of 6 months. The program normally begins in January with 3 weeks of pre-selection. During this time the candidate will take the physical tests required, receive additional training and undergo a 72-hour Field Exercise, which is the core event of the selection process.\n\nMost candidates will fail during the 72-hour exercise which includes long road marches in squad size elements, psychological test batteries, and total sleep deprivation. The pre-selection course is conducted by active operators as well as by enablers of the unit.\n[[File:Jagdkommando trainiert (29638388276).jpg|thumb|Two soldiers of the Jagdkommando]]\nNormally 20-25% of all candidates will pass the pre selection course and continue with the so-called Jagdkommandogrundkurs, the basic course of selection. The first few weeks are held in the remote area of [[Allentsteig]], a giant military training area in close proximity to the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border. The first seven weeks of small unit tactics are overshadowed with plenty of snow, freezing weather, very small amounts of sleep and permanent physical performance. Candidates will get used to the heavy Lowe Rucksack and spend most of their day with it on their backs while conducting patrols, ambushes, and raids in the forests around Allentsteig.\n\nAfter the small unit tactics phase, which will eliminate the last few unfitting candidates, the basic course will continue with block course of two or three weeks each:\n*Basic Demolition Course\n*Airborne Course\n*Amphibious Insertion/Extraction Course\n*Field Survival Course\n*Basic CQB Course\n*Combat diver Course\n*Field training exercises[[File:Jagdkommando Kampfschwimmer.jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando frogmen]][[File:Luftlandung (19889238211).jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Jagdkommando rope down a [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]]]]\n*SERE\n\n===SERE===\nThe final and most infamous course is the SERE training. Over the last few years the SERE training took part in the [[Alps]] of [[Salzburg]]. The \u201crun phase\u201d will last up to ten days, while the candidate must check in at a given checkpoints every 24 hours. The checkpoints are set 20\u201330&nbsp;km apart, considering the mountains in between the points and the tactical need to stay off roads and trails, the candidates will be very busy meeting their time limits and rarely find sleep. Finally after days on the run and being hunted down by infantry units, helicopters and [[Police dog|K9]] units, the candidates will be ambushed and captured at one of their checkpoints. This marks the beginning of the \u201ccaptivity phase\u201d. Being the last phase of the selection course this phase will last 72 hours.\n\nAfter completing the SERE course the remaining soldiers (normally 10-15% of all applicants who started the pre selection course) are accepted into the Jagdkomamndo brotherhood and awarded the \u201cmudd-green\u201d beret with the Unit Crest on it. Most of the graduates will be given a slot as active operators in one of the two Task Groups of the unit, while some go back to their regular Army unit.\n\nJagdkommando soldiers take extreme pride in their long and unique selection course and the prestige that comes along with earning the olive beret inside the armed forces.\n[[File:Austria (\u00d6sterreich), Zeltweg (Flughafen Hinterstoisser), AirPower 2013, OH-58 Kiowa, 0190.JPG|thumb|A soldier of the Jagdkommando on a [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa]]]]\nIf a soldier is chosen to become an operator after selection he will attend the Einsatzausbildung 1, a course where he will refine his operator skills. The training will last up to one year.\n\nNormally it starts off with a five-week drivers course, followed by shooting classes. This will be the first time for operators to use the advanced weapon systems Steyr AUG A2 Kdo and the FN P90. After weeks at the shooting range the next courses will be very mountain orientated, like the mountain airborne course, winter warfare and mountaineering courses as well as ski training.\n\nAfter the mountain courses the individual job training will begin. Depending on the assignment the operator will attend the Weapon Sergeant Course, Medic Course, Communications Sergeant Course or Engineer Course.\n\nThe SOF [[Close combat|CQB]] course that follows teaches the latest techniques in HRO, CC, and DDO. Jagdkommando operators train together with several NATO SOF units worldwide and so the used SOPs and tactics are very similar to other SOF units.\n[[File:Jagdkommando-Soldaten springen aus einer \"Hercules\" (18629580342).jpg|thumb|Jagdkommando soldiers jump out of a C-130 Hercules]]\n[[File:Zugriff (21734716363).jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the Jagdkommando capture a ship on the Danube]]\nDifferent other courses will complete the Einsatzausbildung 1, such as the Urban SR course, advanced combatives training and Air Assault techniques.\n\nAfter more than 18 months of training the operator will be assigned a team in the 1st SOTG (Special Operations Task Group) or the 2nd SOTG. The 3rd SOTG belongs to the Army Reserve Component. A typical Jagdkommando team consists of six operators: the Team Leader, Team Sergeant, a Weapons Sergeant/Sniper, Engineer Sergeant, Medic Sergeant and Communication Sergeant. Each team is assigned to one insertion speciality, such as freefall, amphibious, mountain and mobility.\n\n==Equipment==\n\n* [[Barrett M95]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/jakdo.htm |title=Das Jagdkommando (Jakdo) |language=German |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>\n* [[Barrett M82]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\"/>\n* [[FN Herstal]] [[FN P90|P90]]<ref name=\"dasjakdo\"/><ref>S\u00fcnkler, S\u00f6ren. \"Elite und Spezialeinheiten Europas\" (in German).

Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to.<ref>{{cite web |title=See the history of changes made to a file |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843 |website=Docs editors Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref>\nAn editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats ([[OpenDocument|ODF]], [[HTML]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[Formatted text|Text]], [[Office Open XML]]). Files can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes.\n\n==== Explore ====\nIn March 2014, Google introduced add-ons; new tools from third-party developers that add more features for Google Docs.<ref>{{cite web |first=Saurabh |last=Gupta |title=Bring a little something extra to Docs and Sheets with add-ons |url=https://drive.googleblog.com/2014/03/add-ons.html |website=Google Drive Blog |publisher=Google |date=March 11, 2014 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}</ref>\nIn order to view and edit documents offline on a computer, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser.

Comparing Google's office suite with [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft]]'s and [[iWork|Apple]]'s, he stated that \"Docs exists ''only'' in your Web browser\", meaning that users have \"more limited feature set\" than \"the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app\". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as \"less convenient than a desktop app, and you have to remember to install it before you need it\". Mendelsohn praised the [[user interface]], describing it as \"elegant, highly usable\" with \"fast performance\", and that the revision history \"alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions\". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the \"niftiest new feature\" in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Word files as \"impressive fidelity\". He summarized by praised Docs and the Drive suite for having \"the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too\", while noting that \"it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Mendelsohn |title=Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides |url=https://www.pcmag.com/review/349586/google-docs-sheets-and-slides |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310115437/http://www.pcmag.com/review/349586/google-docs-sheets-and-slides |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 6, 2016 |archivedate=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n=== 2017 phishing incident ===\nIn May 2017, a phishing attack impersonating a Google Docs sharing email spread on the Internet.

Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users are able to see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted to.<ref>{{cite web |title=See the history of changes made to a file |url=https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843 |website=Docs editors Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref>\nAn editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats ([[OpenDocument|ODF]], [[HTML]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[Formatted text|Text]], [[Office Open XML]]).

Comparing Google's office suite with [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft]]'s and [[iWork|Apple]]'s, he stated that \"Docs exists ''only'' in your Web browser\", meaning that users have \"more limited feature set\" than \"the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app\". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as \"less convenient than a desktop app, and you have to remember to install it before you need it\". Mendelsohn praised the [[user interface]], describing it as \"elegant, highly usable\" with \"fast performance\", and that the revision history \"alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions\". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the \"niftiest new feature\" in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Word files as \"impressive fidelity\". He summarized by praised Docs and the Drive suite for having \"the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too\", while noting that \"it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Mendelsohn |title=Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides |url=https://www.pcmag.com/review/349586/google-docs-sheets-and-slides |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310115437/http://www.pcmag.com/review/349586/google-docs-sheets-and-slides |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 6, 2016 |archivedate=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n=== 2017 phishing incident ===\nIn May 2017, a phishing attack impersonating a Google Docs sharing email spread on the Internet.

Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \"angry young man\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including [[censorship]], [[racism]], and [[war]].\n\n==Early life==\nSerling was born on December 25, 1924, in [[Syracuse, New York]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family. He was the second of two sons born to Esther (n\u00e9e Cooper), a homemaker, and Samuel Lawrence Serling.<ref name=CAO>{{cite web | publisher = Contemporary Authors Online, Gale | date=2010| title=Document H1000089528 | url = http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC}}</ref> Serling's father had worked as a secretary and amateur inventor before his children were born, but took on his father-in-law's profession as a grocer to earn a steady income.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|15}} Sam Serling later became a butcher after the Great Depression forced the store to close. Rod had an older brother, novelist and aviation writer [[Robert J. Serling]].<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|23}}<ref name=Scribner>\"Serling, Rodman Edward ('Rod')\".

Sam Serling built a small stage in the basement, where Rod often put on plays (with or without neighborhood children).<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|17\u201318}} His older brother, writer Robert, recalled that, at the age of six or seven, Rod entertained himself for hours by acting out dialogue from pulp magazines or movies he had seen. Rod would often ask questions without waiting for their answers. On a two-hour trip from Binghamton to Syracuse, the rest of the family remained silent to see if Rod would notice their lack of participation. He did not, and talked nonstop through the entire car ride.<ref name=CAO/>\n\nIn elementary school, Serling was seen as the class clown and dismissed by many of his teachers as a lost cause.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|19\u201320}} However, his seventh-grade English teacher, Helen Foley, encouraged him to enter the school's public speaking extracurriculars.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|19}} He joined the debate team and was a speaker at his high school graduation. He began writing for the school newspaper, in which, according to the journalist Gordon Sander, he \"established a reputation as a social activist\".<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|19}}\n[[File:Rod-Serling-HS-yearbook.jpg|thumb|Serling as a senior in high school, 1943]] \nHe was also interested in sports and excelled at [[tennis]] and [[table tennis]].

He was an avid radio listener, especially interested in thrillers, fantasy, and horror shows. [[Arch Oboler]] and [[Norman Corwin]] were two of his favorite writers.<ref name=Grams/> He also \"did some staff work at a Binghamton radio station&nbsp;... tried to write&nbsp;... but never had anything published.\"<ref name=Grams/> He was accepted into college during his senior year of high school. However, the United States was involved in [[World War II]] at the time, and Serling decided to enlist rather than start college immediately after he was graduated from [[Binghamton High School|Binghamton Central High School]] in 1943.<ref name=Scribner/><ref name=Rosenbaum/>\n\n==Military service==\nAs editor of his high school newspaper, Serling encouraged his fellow students to support the war effort. He wanted to leave school before graduation to join the fight, but his civics teacher talked him into waiting for graduation. \"War is a temporary thing,\" Gus Youngstrom told him. \"It ends. Education doesn't. Without your degree, where will you be after the war?\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|36}} Serling enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] the morning after high school graduation, following his brother Robert.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|34, 37}}\n\nSerling began his military career in 1943 at [[Camp Toccoa]], Georgia, under General [[Joseph May Swing|Joseph May \"Joe\" Swing]] and Col. [[Orin D.

He competed as a flyweight and had 17 bouts, rising to the second round of the division finals before being knocked out.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|40}} He was remembered for [[Berserker]] style and for \"getting his nose broken in his first bout and again in the last bout.\"<ref name=Hudson/> He tried his hand at the [[Golden Gloves]], with little success.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nOn April 25, 1944, Serling received his orders and saw that he was being sent west to California. He knew that he would be fighting against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] rather than the [[Third Reich|Germans]]. This disappointed him because he had hoped to help fight [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|40\u201341}} In May, he was assigned to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwzIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22He+was+assigned+in+may+1944+to+the+Pacific%22#v=onepage&q=%22He%20was%20assigned%20in%20may%201944%20to%20the%20Pacific%22&f=false|url-access=subscription|isbn=978-1491720134|last=Reynolds|first=Kenneth|title=The Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Wondrous Land|year=2014|page=3|accessdate=2019-07-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:511th PIR at Manarawat, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Troops of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment evacuate a wounded soldier to an aid station at Manarawat on the island of Leyte, December 1944]]\nIn November 1944, his division first saw combat, landing in the Philippines. The 11th Airborne Division would not be used as paratroopers, however, but as light infantry during the [[Battle of Leyte]]. It helped mop up after the five divisions that had gone ashore earlier.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|43}}\n\nFor a variety of reasons, Serling was transferred to the 511th's demolition platoon, nicknamed \"The Death Squad\" for its high casualty rate. According to Sergeant Frank Lewis, leader of the demolitions squad, \"He screwed up somewhere along the line. Apparently he got on someone's nerves.\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}} Lewis also judged that Serling was not suited to be a field soldier: \"he didn't have the wits or aggressiveness required for combat.\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}} At one point, Lewis, Serling, and others were in a firefight, trapped in a foxhole. As they waited for darkness, Lewis noticed that Serling had not reloaded any of his extra magazines. Serling sometimes went exploring on his own, against orders, and got lost.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}}\n\nSerling's time in Leyte shaped his writing and political views for the rest of his life. He saw death every day while in the Philippines, at the hands of his enemies and his allies, and through freak accidents such as that which killed another Jewish private, Melvin Levy. Levy was delivering a comic monologue for the platoon as they rested under a palm tree when a food crate was dropped from a plane above, decapitating him. Serling led the funeral services for Levy and placed a [[Star of David]] over his grave.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}} Serling later set several of his scripts in the Philippines and used the unpredictability of death as a theme in much of his writing.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|46}}\n\nSerling returned from the successful mission in Leyte with two wounds, including one to his kneecap,<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|47}} but neither kept him from combat when General [[Douglas MacArthur]] deployed the paratroopers for their usual purpose on February 3, 1945. Colonel Haugen led the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment as it landed on [[Tagaytay|Tagaytay Ridge]], met the [[188th Infantry Regiment (United States)|188th Glider Infantry Regiment]] and marched into [[Manila]]. It met minimal resistance until it reached the city, where Vice Admiral [[Sanji Iwabuchi]] had arranged his 17,000 troops behind a maze of traps and guns and ordered them to fight to the death.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|47\u201349}} During the next month, Serling's unit battled block by block for control of [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Manila]].\n\nWhen portions of the city were taken from Japanese control, local civilians sometimes showed their gratitude by throwing parties and hosting banquets. During one of these parties, Serling and his comrades were fired upon, resulting in many soldier and civilian deaths. Serling, still a private after three years, caught the attention of Sergeant Lewis when he ran into the line of fire to rescue a performer who had been on stage when the artillery started firing.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|49}}\n\nAs it moved in on Iwabuchi's stronghold, Serling's regiment had a 50% casualty rate, with over 400 men killed. Serling was wounded and three comrades were killed by shrapnel from rounds fired at his roving demolition team by an antiaircraft gun.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|50}} He was sent to New Guinea to recover but soon returned to Manila to finish \"cleaning up\".\n\nSerling's final assignment was as part of the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation force in Japan]].<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|51}}  During his military service, Private Serling was awarded the [[Purple Heart]], the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]],<ref name=AAYA>''Rod Serling''.

Thousands of scripts were sent in annually, but very few could be produced.<ref name=Grams/> Serling won a trip to New York City and $500 for his radio script \"To Live a Dream\".<ref name=Warrick>{{cite news | last=Warrick| first=Pamela| title=Serling the Storyteller and Master Dreamer | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | date= October 3, 1999 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/03/news/cl-18030| archivedate= December 23, 2012| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121223142826/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/03/news/cl-18030 | url-status=live}}</ref> He and his new wife, Carol, attended the awards broadcast on May 18, 1949, where he and the other winners were interviewed by the star of ''Dr. Christian'', [[Jean Hersholt]]. One of the other winners that day was [[Earl Hamner, Jr.]], who had also earned prizes in previous years. Later, Hamner wrote scripts for Serling's ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nIn addition to earning $45 to $50 a week at the college radio station, Serling attempted to make a living selling freelance scripts of radio programs, but the industry at that time was involved in many lawsuits, which affected willingness to take on new writers (some whose scripts were rejected would often hear a similar plot produced, claim their work had been stolen, and sue for recompense).<ref name=Grams/> Serling was rejected for reasons such as \"heavy competition\", \"this script lacks professional quality\", and \"not what our audience prefers to listen to\".<ref name=Grams/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1949, Martin Horrell of ''[[Grand Central Station (radio)|Grand Central Station]]'' (a radio program known for romances and light dramas) rejected one of Serling's scripts about boxing, because his mostly female listeners \"have told us in no uncertain terms that prize fight stories aren't what they like most\". Horrell advised that \"the script would be far better for sight than for sound only, because in any radio presentation, the fights are not seen. Perhaps this is a baby you should try on some of the producers of television shows.\"<ref name=Grams/>\n\nRealizing the boxing story was not right for ''Grand Central Station'', Serling submitted a lighter piece called ''Hop Off the Express and Grab a Local'', which became his first nationally broadcast piece on September 10, 1949.<ref name=Grams/> His ''Dr. Christian'' script aired on November 30 of that year.\n\nSerling began his professional writing career in 1950, when he earned $75 a week as a network [[Continuity (broadcasting)|continuity writer]] for [[WLW]] radio in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=Grams/><ref name=Rosenbaum/> While at WLW, he continued to freelance. He sold several radio and television scripts to WLW's parent company, [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]]. After selling the scripts, Serling had no further involvement with them. They were sold by [[Powel Crosley|Crosley]] to local stations across the United States.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nSerling submitted an idea for a weekly radio show in which the ghosts of a young boy and girl killed in World War II would look through train windows and comment on day-to-day human life as it moved around the country. This idea was changed significantly, but was produced from October 1950 to February 1951 as ''Adventure Express'', a drama about a girl and boy who travel by train with their uncle. Each week they found adventure in a new town and got involved with the local residents.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nOther radio programs for which Serling wrote scripts include ''Leave It to Kathy'', ''Our America'', and ''Builders of Destiny''. During the production of these, he became acquainted with a voice actor, Jay Overholts, who later became a regular on ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nSerling said of his time as a staff writer for radio, \"From a writing point of view, radio ate up ideas that might have put food on the table for weeks at a future freelancing date. The minute you tie yourself down to a radio or TV station, you write around the clock. You rip out ideas, many of them irreplaceable. They go on and consequently can never go on again. And you've sold them for $50 a week. You can't afford to give away ideas\u2014they're too damn hard to come by. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't staff-write at all. I'd find some other way to support myself while getting a start as a writer.\"<ref name=Grams/>\n\nSerling believed radio was not living up to its potential, later saying, \"Radio, in terms of&nbsp;... drama, dug its own grave. It had aimed downward, had become cheap and unbelievable, and had willingly settled for second best.\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|69}} He opined that there were very few radio writers who would be remembered for their literary contributions.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|69}}\n\n===Television===\n{{Quote box\n| width  = 38em\n| align  = right\n| quote  = I think Rod would have been one of the first to say he hit the new industry, television, at exactly the right time.

At that point, he was really working on television scripts. [I]n 1951 and 1952, the new industry was grabbing up a lot of material and needed it.

His duties included writing [[testimonial]] advertisements for dubious medical remedies and scripts for a comedy duo.<ref name=CAO/> He continued at WKRC after graduation and, amidst the mostly dreary day-to-day work, also created a series of scripts for a live television program, ''The Storm'', as well as for other anthology dramas (a format which was in demand by networks based in New York).<ref name=Scribner/> Following a full day of classes (or, in later years, work), he spent evenings on his own, writing.

His radio scripts received more rejections, so he began rewriting them for television. Whenever a script was rejected by one program, he would resubmit it to another, eventually finding a home for many in either radio or television.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nAs Serling's college years ended, his scripts began to sell.

To Serling, it was just another script, and he missed the first live broadcast. He and his wife hired a babysitter for the night and told her, \"no one would call because we had just moved to town.

Serling was often forced to change his scripts after corporate sponsors read them and found something they felt was too controversial. They were wary of anything they thought might make them look bad to consumers, so references to many contemporary social issues were omitted, as were references to anything that might compete commercially with a sponsor. For instance, the line \"Got a match?\" was deleted because one of the sponsors of \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" was [[Ronson (company)|Ronson]] [[lighter]]s.<ref name=CAO/>\n[[File:Rod Serling relaxing at home 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Serling at home in 1959, with three of his Emmys on the cabinet behind him]]\n\nGould, ''The New York Times'' reviewer, added this [[editorial]] note at the end of a glowing review for ''A Town Has Turned to Dust'', a show about racism and bigotry in a small [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] town: \"'Playhouse 90' and Mr. Serling had to fight executive interference&nbsp;... before getting their play on the air last night.

In an interview with [[Mike Wallace]], he said, \"I don't want to fight anymore. I don't want to have to battle sponsors and agencies. I don't want to have to push for something that I want and have to settle for second best. I don't want to have to compromise all the time, which in essence is what a television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.\"<ref name=CAO/>\n\nSerling submitted \"The Time Element\" to CBS, intending it to be a pilot for his new weekly show, ''The Twilight Zone''. Instead, CBS used the science fiction script for a new show produced by [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Lucille Ball]], ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]],'' in 1958. The story concerns a man who has vivid nightmares of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The man goes to a psychiatrist and, after the session, the [[plot twist|twist ending]] (a device which Serling became known for) reveals the \"patient\" had died at Pearl Harbor, and the ''psychiatrist'' was the one actually having the vivid dreams.<ref name=CAO/> The episode received so much positive fan response that CBS agreed to let Serling go ahead with his pilot for ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name=CAO/>\n\n====''The Storm''====\nBefore ''The Twilight Zone'', Serling created a local television show in Cincinnati on WKRC-TV, ''The Storm'', in the early 1950s. Several of these scripts were rewritten for later use on national network TV.<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Kiesewetter|first1 = John|title = 'The Twilight Zone' Had Roots in Cincinnati|url = http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/history/2014/05/27/rod-serling-twilight-zone-wkrc-tv/9624063/|accessdate = January 22, 2016|work = [[Cincinnati Enquirer]] |publisher = USA Today Network|date = May 27, 2014| archivedate= October 7, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007161630/http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/history/2014/05/27/rod-serling-twilight-zone-wkrc-tv/9624063/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=| url-status=live}}</ref>  A copy of an episode is located in the Cincinnati Museum Center Historical Cincinnati Library on videotape.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/02/08/loc_wlwbar.html |title=Watch Early Shows |date=February 8, 1998 |work=Cincinnati Enquirer |access-date=January 22, 2016 |archivedate=November 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lgIONKcC?url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/02/08/loc_wlwbar.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====''The Twilight Zone''====\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone|The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)}}\n\n[[File:Rod Serling dictating script 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Serling working on a script with a dictating machine, 1959]]\nOn October 2, 1959, the classic ''Twilight Zone'' series, created by Serling, premiered on [[CBS]].<ref name=Scribner/>\n\nFor this series, Serling fought hard to get and maintain creative control. He hired scriptwriters he respected, such as [[Richard Matheson]] and [[Charles Beaumont]]. In an interview, Serling said the show's science fiction format would not be controversial<ref name=AmericanMasters>{{cite episode |title=Rod Serling: Submitted for Your Approval |series=American Masters |serieslink=American Masters |season=10 |number=1 |network=[[PBS]] |airdate=29 November 1995}}</ref> with sponsors, network executives, or the general public and would escape censorship, unlike the earlier script for ''Playhouse 90''.\n\nSerling drew on his own experience for many episodes, frequently about boxing, military life, and airplane pilots. ''The Twilight Zone'' incorporated his social views on racial relations, somewhat veiled in the science fiction and fantasy elements of the shows. Occasionally, the point was quite blunt, such as in the episode \"[[I Am the Night\u2014Color Me Black]]\", in which racism and hatred causes a dark cloud to form in the American South and spread across the world. Many ''Twilight Zone'' stories reflected his views on gender roles, featuring quick-thinking, resilient women as well as shrewish, nagging wives.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' aired for five seasons (the first three presented half-hour episodes, the fourth had hour-long episodes, and the fifth returned to the half-hour format). It won many television and drama awards and drew critical acclaim for Serling and his co-workers. Although it had loyal fans, ''The Twilight Zone'' had only moderate ratings and was twice canceled and revived. After five years and [[List of The Twilight Zone episodes|156 episodes]] (92 written by Serling), he grew weary of the series. In 1964, he decided not to oppose its third and final cancellation.\n\nSerling sold the rights to ''The Twilight Zone'' to CBS. His wife later claimed he did this partly because he believed that his own production company, Cayuga Productions, would never recoup the production costs of the programs, which frequently went over budget.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' eventually resurfaced in the form of a 1983 film by [[Warner Bros]]. Former ''Twilight Zone'' actor [[Burgess Meredith]] was cast as the film's narrator, but does not appear on screen. There have been three attempts to revive the television series with mostly new scripts. In 1985, CBS used [[Charles Aidman]] (and later [[Robin Ward (television personality)|Robin Ward]]) as the narrator. In 2002, [[UPN]] featured [[Forest Whitaker]] in the role of narrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/23/entertainment/et-susan23|title=UPN Hoping It Can Revive the Magic of 'Twilight Zone' Series | first= Susan |last= King| date=September 23, 2002|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | archivedate=August 18, 2016 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160818113710/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/23/entertainment/et-susan23| url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, CBS made a [[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|third attempt]] at a successful revival, with [[Jordan Peele]] taking on producing duties as well as being host and narrator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/jordan-peele-twilight-zone-cbs-all-access-rod-serling-1202468028/|title='The Twilight Zone': Jordan Peele To Host & Narrate CBS All Access Reboot|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|last2=Ramos|first2=Dino-Ray|date=2018-09-20|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n\n====''A Carol for Another Christmas''====\n''[[A Carol for Another Christmas]]'' was a 1964 American television movie, scripted by Rod Serling as a modernization of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' and a plea for global cooperation between nations.

The cast included [[Percy Rodriguez]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Ben Gazzara]], Barbara Ann Teer, [[James Shigeta]], and Britt Ekland.

Serling appeared more-or-less as a version of himself (but named \"Mr. Zone\") in a comedic bit on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''; he appears in a 1962 episode of the short-lived sitcom ''[[Ichabod and Me]]'' in the role of Eugene Hollinfield; and in a 1972 episode of the crime drama ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]'' entitled \"Bubble, Bubble, Toil, and Murder\" (which also featured a young [[Jodie Foster]]), in which he plays a small role as the proprietor of an occult magic shop.\n\n===Other radio===\n\n====''The Zero Hour''====\nSerling returned to radio late in his career with ''[[The Zero Hour (U.S. radio series)|The Zero Hour]]'' (also known as ''Hollywood Radio Theater'') in 1973. The drama anthology series featured tales of mystery, adventure, and suspense, airing in stereo for two seasons. Serling hosted the program and wrote some of the scripts.\n\nOriginally placed into syndication on September 3, 1973, the series was picked up by the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] in December of that year. The original format featured five-part dramas broadcast Monday through Friday, with the story coming to a conclusion on Friday. Including commercials, each part was approximately 30 minutes long. Mutual affiliates could broadcast the series in any time slot that they wished.\n\nIn 1974, still airing five days a week, the program changed to a full story in a single 30-minute installment with the same actor starring throughout the week in all five programs. That format was employed from late April 1974 to the end of the series on July 26, 1974.\n\n====''Fantasy Park''====\nSerling's final radio performance, which he recorded just a few weeks before his death, was even more unusual: ''Fantasy Park'' was a 48-hour-long rock concert aired by nearly 200 stations over [[Labor Day]] weekend in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelradio.com/bw/index.html |title=The Beau Weaver Collection |publisher=[[Reel Top 40 Radio Repository|ReelRadio]] |quote= Fantasy Park Demo, KNUS Dallas, 1975&nbsp;... a 48 hour radio special hosted by Rod Serling&nbsp;...|accessdate=September 6, 2013| archivedate=January 14, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114103033/http://www.reelradio.com/bw/index.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The program, produced by [[KNUS]] in [[Dallas]], featured performances by dozens of rock stars of the day, and even reunited the [[Beatles]]. It was also completely ''imaginary'', a \"theatre-of-the-mind for the 70s\", as producer [[Beau Weaver]] put it, using record albums recorded live in concert, plus crowd noise and other sound effects. (Stations who aired the special were reportedly inundated by callers demanding to know how to get to the nonexistent concert.) KNUS general manager Bart McLendon recruited Serling (his old teacher) to record the host segments, bumpers, custom promos, and television spots.\n\nSerling wrote the disclaimers, which aired each hour: \"Hello, this is Rod Serling and welcome back to ''Fantasy Park''\u2014the crowds here today are unreal.\" \"This is ''Fantasy Park''\u2014the greatest live concert\u2014''never'' held.\"\n\n===Teaching===\nSerling kept his schedule full. When he was not writing, promoting, or producing his work, he often spoke on college campuses around the country.<ref name=Rosenbaum/> He taught week-long seminars in which students would watch and critique films. In the political climate of the 1960s, he often felt a stronger connection to the older students in his evening classes.<ref name=Rosenbaum/> Serling's critique of high school student writing was a pivotal experience for writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]].<ref name=\"jms1995\">{{cite newsgroup\n | title = JMS compiled messages [9/27/95] (2/2) {{!}} Subj:  OTHERSYDE\n | author = J. Michael Straczynski\n | author-link = J.

Desiring to take a break and clear his mind, he took a one-year teaching job as writer in residence at Antioch College, Ohio. He taught classes in the 1962\u201363 school year on writing and drama and a survey course covering the \"social and historical implications of the media.\"<ref name=CAO/><ref name=Scribner/> He used this time to teach as well as work on a new screenplay, ''[[Seven Days in May]]''.<ref name=Scribner/>\n\nLater he taught at [[Ithaca College]], from the late 1960s until his death in 1975.<ref name=CAO/><ref name=Memorial>{{cite news | title = Serling Memorial Monday | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70D13FD3B58157493C3A9178CD85F418785F9 | agency = [[United Press International]] | work =[[The New York Times]] | date= July 1, 1975 | page= 32 | accessdate = September 16, 2013}} Abstract of pay-site article.</ref> He was one of the first guest teachers at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood, California.

Just drawing back and drawing in, becoming narcissistic.\"<ref name=Rosenbaum/> This philosophy can be seen in his writing. Some themes appear again and again in his writing, many of which are concerned with war and politics. Another common theme is equality among all people.\n\n===Antiwar activism===\nSerling's experiences as a soldier left him with strong opinions about the use of military force. He was an outspoken antiwar activist, especially during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=Scribner/> He supported antiwar politicians, notably [[Eugene McCarthy]] in his [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential campaign in 1968]].<ref name=Scribner/>\n\n\"The Rack\" is an example of Serling's use of television to speak his mind on political issues. This script for ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' tells the story of an army captain charged with collaborating with the North Koreans. ''The New York Times'' reviewer J. P. Shanley called it \"controversial and compelling\".<ref name=shanley /> Serling tackled a question that was much in the media at the time: should veterans be charged with a crime if they cooperated with the enemy while under duress? In this courtroom drama the accused is put on trial for helping the enemy by urging fellow [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to cooperate with their captors. Serling offers many valid arguments on behalf of both the defense and the prosecution. Each has a strong case, but in the end, the captain is found guilty. There is no Serling narration to conclude the drama, as he had become famous for in ''The Twilight Zone''\u2014instead, the audience is left to make their own conclusions after the verdict has been rendered.<ref name=shanley>{{Citation |last=Shanley |first= J.

It told of a place that no longer celebrated Christmas, although none of the residents know why it has been canceled. Meanwhile, at the North Pole, the audience sees Santa Claus dealing with striking elves. Rather than creating toys and candy, the North Pole manufactures a diversity of bombs and offensive gases. Santa has been shot at on his route, and an elf was hit by shrapnel.<ref name=Grams/>\n\n\"24 Men to a Plane\" recounts Serling's first combat jump into the area around Manila in 1945. The combat jump became a fiasco after the jumpmaster in the first plane dropped his men too early, causing every subsequent plane to drop in synchronization with the mistake.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|48}}\n\n===Racial equality===\n''A Town Has Turned to Dust'' received a positive review from the critic [[Jack Gould]], who was known for being straightforward to the point of being harsh in his reviews. He called ''A Town Has Turned to Dust,'' \"a raw, tough and at the same time deeply moving outcry against prejudice.\"<ref name=Gould1958/> Set in a Southwestern town in a deep [[drought]], it sees poverty and despair turn racial tensions deadly when the ineffectual sheriff is unable to stand against the town. A young Mexican boy is lynched, and the town as a whole is to blame. A second lynching is in the works after a series of events leads again to the town turning against the Mexicans. This time, the sheriff stands strong, and the first boy's brother is saved, even as the town is not. \"Mr. Serling incorporated his protest against prejudice in vivid dialogue and sound situations. He made his point that hate for a fellow being leads only to the ultimate destruction of the bigoted.\"<ref name=Gould1958/>\n\nSerling took his 1972 screenplay for the film, [[The Man (Wallace novel)|''The Man'']], from the [[Irving Wallace]] novel of the same title. The black senator from [[New Hampshire]] and president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate, played by [[James Earl Jones]], assumes the U.S. presidency by succession.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rod Serling Memorial-2.png|thumb|A memorial in honor of Serling in his home town of Binghamton, New York]]\nSerling was said to smoke three to four packs of cigarettes a day.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/29/archives/rod-serling-of-twilight-zone-and-night-gallery-on-tv-dies-won-six.html | title=Rod Serling of 'Twilight Zone' and 'Night Gallery' on TV Dies| newspaper=The New York Times| date=June 29, 1975| last1=Hudson| first1=Edward}}</ref> On May 3, 1975, he had a minor [[heart attack]] and was hospitalized.

The first public viewing of an all-electronic television was presented by inventor [[Philo Farnsworth]] at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934, when Serling was nine years old. Commercial television officially started on July 1, 1941. At the time, there were fewer than seven thousand television sets in the United States, and very few of those were in private homes.<ref name=McMahon2007/>{{rp|21}} Only five months later, the U.S. entered World War II, and the television business was put on hold until the war's end,<ref name=McMahon2007/>{{rp|22}} as many of the sets were confiscated by the government and repurposed to train air-raid wardens.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|57}} After World War II ended, money began flowing toward the new medium of television, coinciding with the beginning of Serling's writing career. Early programming consisted of newsreels, sporting events and what would be called [[public-access television]] today. It was not until 1948 that filmed dramas were first shown, beginning with a show called ''[[Public Prosecutor (TV series)|Public Prosecutor]]''.<ref name=McMahon2007/>{{rp|25}} Serling began having serious dramas produced in 1950 and is given credit as one of the first to write scripts specifically for television. As such, he is said to have helped legitimize television drama.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|28}}\n\nSerling worried that television was on the verge of suffering the same decline as radio. He encouraged sponsors to see television as a platform for the kind of dramatic entertainment that could address important social matters through subtle meanings, instead of being \"an animated billboard.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Brian|date=Winter 2016|title=The Enduring Legacy of \"The Twilight Zone\"|journal=The New Atlantis|volume=48|issue=48|pages=90\u2013112|jstor=43766985}}</ref>\n\nThe format of writing for television was changing rapidly in the early years, but eventually, it settled into a pattern of commercial breaks on each quarter-hour. Writers were forced to work these breaks into their scripts. Serling's response to this convention was, \"How can you put out a meaningful drama when every fifteen minutes proceedings are interrupted by twelve dancing rabbits with toilet paper? No dramatic art form should be dictated and controlled by men whose training and instincts are cut of an entirely different cloth. The fact remains that these gentlemen sell consumer goods, not an art form.\"<ref name=\"AmericanMasters\" /> Throughout his career Serling helped to mold the future of television.\n\n====Writing for multiple media====\nAs early as 1955, Jack Gould, of the ''New York Times'', commented on the close ties that were then being created between television and movies. Serling was among the first to use both forms, turning his early television successes, \"Patterns\" and \"The Rack\", into full-length movies.<ref name=gould>Gould, Jack. \"Some Reason for Optimism\". ''New York Times'', April 24, 1955. p. X11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: ''New York Times'' (1851\u20132006).</ref> Up to that time, many established writers were unwilling to write for television because the programs were viewed only once and then stored in a vault, never to be seen again.<ref name=Twice>Gould, Jack. \"TV: Twice-Told Tale\". ''New York Times'', February 11, 1955. p. 31. ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''New York Times'' (1851\u20132006)</ref>\n\n====Beginning of the rerun====\nAfter the first showing of \"Patterns\", the studio received such positive feedback that it produced a repeat performance, the first time a television program had been replayed at the request of the audience. Although successful shows had sometimes been recreated after two years or more, this was the first time a show was recreated exactly&nbsp;\u2014 with the same cast and crew&nbsp;\u2014 as it had been originally broadcast.<ref>Adams, Val. \"Kraft to Repeat 'Patterns' on TV\". ''New York Times'', January 20, 1955. p. 38. ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''New York Times'' (1851\u20132006).</ref> The second live performance, only a month later, was equally successful and inspired ''New York Times'' critic Jack Gould to write an essay on the use of replays on television. He stated that \"Patterns\" was a prime example of a drama that should be seen more than once, whereas a single broadcast was the norm for television shows of the day. Sponsors believed that creating new shows every week would assure them the largest possible audience, so they purchased a new script for each night. Gould suggested that as new networks were opened and the viewers were given more choices, the percentage of viewers would spread among the offerings. \"Patterns\" was proof that a second showing could gain more viewers because those who missed the first showing could see the second, thus increasing the audience for sponsors.<ref name=Twice/>\n\n==Effects on popular culture==\n\n===During his lifetime===\nIn December 1966, the made-for-television movie ''The Doomsday Flight'' aired. The fictional plot concerned an airplane with a bomb aboard. If the plane landed without the ransom money being paid, the aircraft would explode. The bomb was set with an altitude trigger that would detonate it if the plane dropped below four thousand feet. The show was one of the highest-rated of the television season, but both Serling and his brother Robert, a technical advisor on the project (a specialist in aviation), regretted making the film. After the film was aired, a rash of copycats telephoned in ransom demands to most of the largest airlines. Serling was truly devastated by what his script had encouraged. He told reporters who flocked to interview him, \"I wish to Christ that I had written a stagecoach drama starring John Wayne instead.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=John |authorlink1=John E.

It has been released in comic book form, as a magazine, a [[Twilight Zone: The Movie|film]], and three additional television series from [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|1985 to 1989]], from [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002 to 2003]], and again in [[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|2019]]. In 1988, [[J. Michael Straczynski]] scripted Serling's outline \"Our Selena Is Dying\" for the 1980s ''Twilight Zone'' revival.\n\nSome of Serling's works are now available in [[graphic novel]]s. ''Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone'' is a series of adaptations by Mark Kneece and Rich Ellis based on original scripts written by Serling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kneece |first=Mark |year=2009 |title=Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone: The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Walker & Company]] |isbn=978-0-8027-9713-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802797131/page/1 1] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802797131/page/1 }}</ref> Several episodes were adapted into novel form for pulp fiction books by Serling himself.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' is not the only Serling work to reappear. In 1994, ''[[Rod Serling's Lost Classics]]'' released two never-before-seen works that Carol Serling found in her garage. The first was an outline called, \"The Theatre\", that Richard Matheson expanded. The second was a complete script written by Serling, \"Where the Dead Are\".\n\nIn 1975, the Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] dedicated its third studio album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]'', to Serling. Its fourth album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', includes a song entitled \"[[The Twilight Zone (Rush song)|The Twilight Zone]]\", in which the two verses are each based on an episode of the series.<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/rush/the-twilight-zone</ref>\n\nSerling and his work on ''The Twilight Zone'' inspired the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme park]] attraction, [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]], which debuted at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in Florida in 1994.

This was accomplished using footage from ''The Twilight Zone'' episode \"[[The Midnight Sun]]\" and digitally manipulating Serling's mouth to match new dialogue spoken by voice actor Mark Silverman. The plot involved paintings coming to life, a nod to both ''The Twilight Zone'' and ''Night Gallery''.\n\nOn August 11, 2009, the [[United States Postal Service]] released its ''Early TV Memories'' commemorative stamp collection honoring notable television programs. One of the 20 stamps honored ''The Twilight Zone'' and featured a portrait of Serling.<ref>{{cite press release| url = http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2008/pr08_136.htm | title= Postal Service Previews 2009 Commemorative Stamp Program: Early TV Memories | date= December 29, 1008 | publisher = [[United States Postal Service]] | archivedate= July 17, 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717182854/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2008/pr08_136.htm}}</ref>\n\nSerling's work, particularly the ''Twilight Zone'' episode \"[[Walking Distance]]\", underpins the romantic comedy ''[[The Rewrite]]'' (2014), which is largely set in Binghamton.<ref name=\"bing_12Re\">{{Cite web |title=12 Reasons Why \"The Rewrite\" is the Ultimate Binghamton Movie - Binghamton University Blog |author= |work=binghamton.edu |date= |access-date=27 February 2019 |url= https://www.binghamton.edu/blog/index.php/blog/story/12551/reasons-why-the-rewrite-is-the-ultimate-bing-movie/ |language= |quote=Bin }}</ref>\n\nThrough a mix of computer animation, a simulated version of Serling appeared at the end of the \"Blurryman\" episode of the 2019 revival of ''[[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \"angry young man\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including [[censorship]], [[racism]], and [[war]].\n\n==Early life==\nSerling was born on December 25, 1924, in [[Syracuse, New York]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family. He was the second of two sons born to Esther (n\u00e9e Cooper), a homemaker, and Samuel Lawrence Serling.<ref name=CAO>{{cite web | publisher = Contemporary Authors Online, Gale | date=2010| title=Document H1000089528 | url = http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC}}</ref> Serling's father had worked as a secretary and amateur inventor before his children were born, but took on his father-in-law's profession as a grocer to earn a steady income.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|15}} Sam Serling later became a butcher after the Great Depression forced the store to close.

Sam Serling built a small stage in the basement, where Rod often put on plays (with or without neighborhood children).<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|17\u201318}} His older brother, writer Robert, recalled that, at the age of six or seven, Rod entertained himself for hours by acting out dialogue from pulp magazines or movies he had seen. Rod would often ask questions without waiting for their answers. On a two-hour trip from Binghamton to Syracuse, the rest of the family remained silent to see if Rod would notice their lack of participation. He did not, and talked nonstop through the entire car ride.<ref name=CAO/>\n\nIn elementary school, Serling was seen as the class clown and dismissed by many of his teachers as a lost cause.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|19\u201320}} However, his seventh-grade English teacher, Helen Foley, encouraged him to enter the school's public speaking extracurriculars.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|19}} He joined the debate team and was a speaker at his high school graduation. He began writing for the school newspaper, in which, according to the journalist Gordon Sander, he \"established a reputation as a social activist\".<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|19}}\n[[File:Rod-Serling-HS-yearbook.jpg|thumb|Serling as a senior in high school, 1943]] \nHe was also interested in sports and excelled at [[tennis]] and [[table tennis]].

He was an avid radio listener, especially interested in thrillers, fantasy, and horror shows. [[Arch Oboler]] and [[Norman Corwin]] were two of his favorite writers.<ref name=Grams/> He also \"did some staff work at a Binghamton radio station&nbsp;... tried to write&nbsp;... but never had anything published.\"<ref name=Grams/> He was accepted into college during his senior year of high school. However, the United States was involved in [[World War II]] at the time, and Serling decided to enlist rather than start college immediately after he was graduated from [[Binghamton High School|Binghamton Central High School]] in 1943.<ref name=Scribner/><ref name=Rosenbaum/>\n\n==Military service==\nAs editor of his high school newspaper, Serling encouraged his fellow students to support the war effort. He wanted to leave school before graduation to join the fight, but his civics teacher talked him into waiting for graduation. \"War is a temporary thing,\" Gus Youngstrom told him. \"It ends. Education doesn't. Without your degree, where will you be after the war?\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|36}} Serling enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] the morning after high school graduation, following his brother Robert.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|34, 37}}\n\nSerling began his military career in 1943 at [[Camp Toccoa]], Georgia, under General [[Joseph May Swing|Joseph May \"Joe\" Swing]] and Col. [[Orin D.

He competed as a flyweight and had 17 bouts, rising to the second round of the division finals before being knocked out.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|40}} He was remembered for [[Berserker]] style and for \"getting his nose broken in his first bout and again in the last bout.\"<ref name=Hudson/> He tried his hand at the [[Golden Gloves]], with little success.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nOn April 25, 1944, Serling received his orders and saw that he was being sent west to California. He knew that he would be fighting against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] rather than the [[Third Reich|Germans]]. This disappointed him because he had hoped to help fight [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|40\u201341}} In May, he was assigned to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwzIDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22He+was+assigned+in+may+1944+to+the+Pacific%22#v=onepage&q=%22He%20was%20assigned%20in%20may%201944%20to%20the%20Pacific%22&f=false|url-access=subscription|isbn=978-1491720134|last=Reynolds|first=Kenneth|title=The Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Wondrous Land|year=2014|page=3|accessdate=2019-07-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:511th PIR at Manarawat, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Troops of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment evacuate a wounded soldier to an aid station at Manarawat on the island of Leyte, December 1944]]\nIn November 1944, his division first saw combat, landing in the Philippines. The 11th Airborne Division would not be used as paratroopers, however, but as light infantry during the [[Battle of Leyte]]. It helped mop up after the five divisions that had gone ashore earlier.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|43}}\n\nFor a variety of reasons, Serling was transferred to the 511th's demolition platoon, nicknamed \"The Death Squad\" for its high casualty rate. According to Sergeant Frank Lewis, leader of the demolitions squad, \"He screwed up somewhere along the line. Apparently he got on someone's nerves.\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}} Lewis also judged that Serling was not suited to be a field soldier: \"he didn't have the wits or aggressiveness required for combat.\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}} At one point, Lewis, Serling, and others were in a firefight, trapped in a foxhole. As they waited for darkness, Lewis noticed that Serling had not reloaded any of his extra magazines. Serling sometimes went exploring on his own, against orders, and got lost.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|45}}\n\nSerling's time in Leyte shaped his writing and political views for the rest of his life. He saw death every day while in the Philippines, at the hands of his enemies and his allies, and through freak accidents such as that which killed another Jewish private, Melvin Levy. Levy was delivering a comic monologue for the platoon as they rested under a palm tree when a food crate was dropped from a plane above, decapitating him.

Colonel Haugen led the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment as it landed on [[Tagaytay|Tagaytay Ridge]], met the [[188th Infantry Regiment (United States)|188th Glider Infantry Regiment]] and marched into [[Manila]]. It met minimal resistance until it reached the city, where Vice Admiral [[Sanji Iwabuchi]] had arranged his 17,000 troops behind a maze of traps and guns and ordered them to fight to the death.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|47\u201349}} During the next month, Serling's unit battled block by block for control of [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Manila]].\n\nWhen portions of the city were taken from Japanese control, local civilians sometimes showed their gratitude by throwing parties and hosting banquets. During one of these parties, Serling and his comrades were fired upon, resulting in many soldier and civilian deaths. Serling, still a private after three years, caught the attention of Sergeant Lewis when he ran into the line of fire to rescue a performer who had been on stage when the artillery started firing.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|49}}\n\nAs it moved in on Iwabuchi's stronghold, Serling's regiment had a 50% casualty rate, with over 400 men killed.

He then took charge of full-scale radio productions at Antioch which were broadcast on WJEM, in Springfield. He wrote and directed the programs and acted in them when needed. He created the entire output for the 1948\u20131949 school year. With one exception (an adaptation), all the writing that year was his original work.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nWhile in college, Serling won his first accolade as a writer. The radio program, ''[[Dr. Christian]]'', had started an annual scriptwriting contest eight years earlier. Thousands of scripts were sent in annually, but very few could be produced.<ref name=Grams/> Serling won a trip to New York City and $500 for his radio script \"To Live a Dream\".<ref name=Warrick>{{cite news | last=Warrick| first=Pamela| title=Serling the Storyteller and Master Dreamer | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | date= October 3, 1999 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/03/news/cl-18030| archivedate= December 23, 2012| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121223142826/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/03/news/cl-18030 | url-status=live}}</ref> He and his new wife, Carol, attended the awards broadcast on May 18, 1949, where he and the other winners were interviewed by the star of ''Dr. Christian'', [[Jean Hersholt]]. One of the other winners that day was [[Earl Hamner, Jr.]], who had also earned prizes in previous years. Later, Hamner wrote scripts for Serling's ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nIn addition to earning $45 to $50 a week at the college radio station, Serling attempted to make a living selling freelance scripts of radio programs, but the industry at that time was involved in many lawsuits, which affected willingness to take on new writers (some whose scripts were rejected would often hear a similar plot produced, claim their work had been stolen, and sue for recompense).<ref name=Grams/> Serling was rejected for reasons such as \"heavy competition\", \"this script lacks professional quality\", and \"not what our audience prefers to listen to\".<ref name=Grams/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1949, Martin Horrell of ''[[Grand Central Station (radio)|Grand Central Station]]'' (a radio program known for romances and light dramas) rejected one of Serling's scripts about boxing, because his mostly female listeners \"have told us in no uncertain terms that prize fight stories aren't what they like most\". Horrell advised that \"the script would be far better for sight than for sound only, because in any radio presentation, the fights are not seen. Perhaps this is a baby you should try on some of the producers of television shows.\"<ref name=Grams/>\n\nRealizing the boxing story was not right for ''Grand Central Station'', Serling submitted a lighter piece called ''Hop Off the Express and Grab a Local'', which became his first nationally broadcast piece on September 10, 1949.<ref name=Grams/> His ''Dr. Christian'' script aired on November 30 of that year.\n\nSerling began his professional writing career in 1950, when he earned $75 a week as a network [[Continuity (broadcasting)|continuity writer]] for [[WLW]] radio in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=Grams/><ref name=Rosenbaum/> While at WLW, he continued to freelance. He sold several radio and television scripts to WLW's parent company, [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]]. After selling the scripts, Serling had no further involvement with them. They were sold by [[Powel Crosley|Crosley]] to local stations across the United States.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nSerling submitted an idea for a weekly radio show in which the ghosts of a young boy and girl killed in World War II would look through train windows and comment on day-to-day human life as it moved around the country. This idea was changed significantly, but was produced from October 1950 to February 1951 as ''Adventure Express'', a drama about a girl and boy who travel by train with their uncle. Each week they found adventure in a new town and got involved with the local residents.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nOther radio programs for which Serling wrote scripts include ''Leave It to Kathy'', ''Our America'', and ''Builders of Destiny''. During the production of these, he became acquainted with a voice actor, Jay Overholts, who later became a regular on ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nSerling said of his time as a staff writer for radio, \"From a writing point of view, radio ate up ideas that might have put food on the table for weeks at a future freelancing date. The minute you tie yourself down to a radio or TV station, you write around the clock. You rip out ideas, many of them irreplaceable. They go on and consequently can never go on again. And you've sold them for $50 a week. You can't afford to give away ideas\u2014they're too damn hard to come by. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't staff-write at all. I'd find some other way to support myself while getting a start as a writer.\"<ref name=Grams/>\n\nSerling believed radio was not living up to its potential, later saying, \"Radio, in terms of&nbsp;... drama, dug its own grave. It had aimed downward, had become cheap and unbelievable, and had willingly settled for second best.\"<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|69}} He opined that there were very few radio writers who would be remembered for their literary contributions.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|69}}\n\n===Television===\n{{Quote box\n| width  = 38em\n| align  = right\n| quote  = I think Rod would have been one of the first to say he hit the new industry, television, at exactly the right time.

At that point, he was really working on television scripts. [I]n 1951 and 1952, the new industry was grabbing up a lot of material and needed it.

His duties included writing [[testimonial]] advertisements for dubious medical remedies and scripts for a comedy duo.<ref name=CAO/> He continued at WKRC after graduation and, amidst the mostly dreary day-to-day work, also created a series of scripts for a live television program, ''The Storm'', as well as for other anthology dramas (a format which was in demand by networks based in New York).<ref name=Scribner/> Following a full day of classes (or, in later years, work), he spent evenings on his own, writing. He sent manuscripts to publishers and received forty rejection slips during these early years.<ref name=CAO/>\n\nIn 1950, Serling hired Blanche Gaines as an agent. His radio scripts received more rejections, so he began rewriting them for television. Whenever a script was rejected by one program, he would resubmit it to another, eventually finding a home for many in either radio or television.<ref name=Grams/>\n\nAs Serling's college years ended, his scripts began to sell.

He recalled, \"Writing is a demanding profession and a selfish one. And because it is selfish and demanding, because it is compulsive and exacting, I didn't embrace it. I succumbed to it.\"<ref name=CAO/>\n\nAccording to his wife, Serling \"just up and quit one day, during the winter of 1952, about six months before our first daughter Jody was born\u2014though he was also doing some freelancing and working on a weekly dramatic show for another Cincinnati station.\"<ref name=Rosenbaum/> He and his family moved to [[Connecticut]] in early 1953.

To Serling, it was just another script, and he missed the first live broadcast. He and his wife hired a babysitter for the night and told her, \"no one would call because we had just moved to town.

Serling was often forced to change his scripts after corporate sponsors read them and found something they felt was too controversial. They were wary of anything they thought might make them look bad to consumers, so references to many contemporary social issues were omitted, as were references to anything that might compete commercially with a sponsor. For instance, the line \"Got a match?\" was deleted because one of the sponsors of \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" was [[Ronson (company)|Ronson]] [[lighter]]s.<ref name=CAO/>\n[[File:Rod Serling relaxing at home 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Serling at home in 1959, with three of his Emmys on the cabinet behind him]]\n\nGould, ''The New York Times'' reviewer, added this [[editorial]] note at the end of a glowing review for ''A Town Has Turned to Dust'', a show about racism and bigotry in a small [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] town: \"'Playhouse 90' and Mr. Serling had to fight executive interference&nbsp;... before getting their play on the air last night.

In an interview with [[Mike Wallace]], he said, \"I don't want to fight anymore. I don't want to have to battle sponsors and agencies. I don't want to have to push for something that I want and have to settle for second best. I don't want to have to compromise all the time, which in essence is what a television writer does if he wants to put on controversial themes.\"<ref name=CAO/>\n\nSerling submitted \"The Time Element\" to CBS, intending it to be a pilot for his new weekly show, ''The Twilight Zone''. Instead, CBS used the science fiction script for a new show produced by [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Lucille Ball]], ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]],'' in 1958. The story concerns a man who has vivid nightmares of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The man goes to a psychiatrist and, after the session, the [[plot twist|twist ending]] (a device which Serling became known for) reveals the \"patient\" had died at Pearl Harbor, and the ''psychiatrist'' was the one actually having the vivid dreams.<ref name=CAO/> The episode received so much positive fan response that CBS agreed to let Serling go ahead with his pilot for ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name=CAO/>\n\n====''The Storm''====\nBefore ''The Twilight Zone'', Serling created a local television show in Cincinnati on WKRC-TV, ''The Storm'', in the early 1950s. Several of these scripts were rewritten for later use on national network TV.<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Kiesewetter|first1 = John|title = 'The Twilight Zone' Had Roots in Cincinnati|url = http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/history/2014/05/27/rod-serling-twilight-zone-wkrc-tv/9624063/|accessdate = January 22, 2016|work = [[Cincinnati Enquirer]] |publisher = USA Today Network|date = May 27, 2014| archivedate= October 7, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007161630/http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/history/2014/05/27/rod-serling-twilight-zone-wkrc-tv/9624063/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=| url-status=live}}</ref>  A copy of an episode is located in the Cincinnati Museum Center Historical Cincinnati Library on videotape.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/02/08/loc_wlwbar.html |title=Watch Early Shows |date=February 8, 1998 |work=Cincinnati Enquirer |access-date=January 22, 2016 |archivedate=November 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lgIONKcC?url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1998/02/08/loc_wlwbar.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====''The Twilight Zone''====\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone|The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)}}\n\n[[File:Rod Serling dictating script 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Serling working on a script with a dictating machine, 1959]]\nOn October 2, 1959, the classic ''Twilight Zone'' series, created by Serling, premiered on [[CBS]].<ref name=Scribner/>\n\nFor this series, Serling fought hard to get and maintain creative control. He hired scriptwriters he respected, such as [[Richard Matheson]] and [[Charles Beaumont]]. In an interview, Serling said the show's science fiction format would not be controversial<ref name=AmericanMasters>{{cite episode |title=Rod Serling: Submitted for Your Approval |series=American Masters |serieslink=American Masters |season=10 |number=1 |network=[[PBS]] |airdate=29 November 1995}}</ref> with sponsors, network executives, or the general public and would escape censorship, unlike the earlier script for ''Playhouse 90''.\n\nSerling drew on his own experience for many episodes, frequently about boxing, military life, and airplane pilots. ''The Twilight Zone'' incorporated his social views on racial relations, somewhat veiled in the science fiction and fantasy elements of the shows. Occasionally, the point was quite blunt, such as in the episode \"[[I Am the Night\u2014Color Me Black]]\", in which racism and hatred causes a dark cloud to form in the American South and spread across the world. Many ''Twilight Zone'' stories reflected his views on gender roles, featuring quick-thinking, resilient women as well as shrewish, nagging wives.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' aired for five seasons (the first three presented half-hour episodes, the fourth had hour-long episodes, and the fifth returned to the half-hour format). It won many television and drama awards and drew critical acclaim for Serling and his co-workers. Although it had loyal fans, ''The Twilight Zone'' had only moderate ratings and was twice canceled and revived. After five years and [[List of The Twilight Zone episodes|156 episodes]] (92 written by Serling), he grew weary of the series. In 1964, he decided not to oppose its third and final cancellation.\n\nSerling sold the rights to ''The Twilight Zone'' to CBS. His wife later claimed he did this partly because he believed that his own production company, Cayuga Productions, would never recoup the production costs of the programs, which frequently went over budget.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' eventually resurfaced in the form of a 1983 film by [[Warner Bros]]. Former ''Twilight Zone'' actor [[Burgess Meredith]] was cast as the film's narrator, but does not appear on screen. There have been three attempts to revive the television series with mostly new scripts. In 1985, CBS used [[Charles Aidman]] (and later [[Robin Ward (television personality)|Robin Ward]]) as the narrator. In 2002, [[UPN]] featured [[Forest Whitaker]] in the role of narrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/23/entertainment/et-susan23|title=UPN Hoping It Can Revive the Magic of 'Twilight Zone' Series | first= Susan |last= King| date=September 23, 2002|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | archivedate=August 18, 2016 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160818113710/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/23/entertainment/et-susan23| url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, CBS made a [[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|third attempt]] at a successful revival, with [[Jordan Peele]] taking on producing duties as well as being host and narrator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/jordan-peele-twilight-zone-cbs-all-access-rod-serling-1202468028/|title='The Twilight Zone': Jordan Peele To Host & Narrate CBS All Access Reboot|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|last2=Ramos|first2=Dino-Ray|date=2018-09-20|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n\n====''A Carol for Another Christmas''====\n''[[A Carol for Another Christmas]]'' was a 1964 American television movie, scripted by Rod Serling as a modernization of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' and a plea for global cooperation between nations.

Mankiewicz]], this was the film in which [[Peter Sellers]] gave his first performance after a series of near-fatal heart attacks in the wake of his marriage to [[Britt Ekland]]. Sellers portrayed a demagogue in an apocalyptic Christmas. [[Sterling Hayden]], who costarred with Sellers in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' earlier that year, also was featured. The cast included [[Percy Rodriguez]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Ben Gazzara]], Barbara Ann Teer, [[James Shigeta]], and Britt Ekland. [[Henry Mancini]] wrote the theme music, which was recorded for his 1966 holiday LP, ''A Merry Mancini Christmas''. The film is not commercially available, but it can be seen at the [[Paley Center for Media]] in New York and Los Angeles and the Film and Television Archive at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].\n\n[[Turner Classic Movies]] telecast ''A Carol for Another Christmas'' for the first time in 48 years, on December 16 and 22, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/963811/Carol-for-Another-Christmas-A/ |title=''A Carol for Another Christmas'' (1964) |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] |archivedate=December 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222015355/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/963811/Carol-for-Another-Christmas-A/ }}</ref> TCM aired it again on December 19 and 20, 2013.\n\n====''Night Gallery''====\n{{Main|Night Gallery}}\n\nIn 1969, [[NBC]] aired a [[Night Gallery (film)|television film pilot]] for a new series, ''Night Gallery'', written by Serling. Set in a dimly lit museum after hours, the pilot film featured Serling (as on-camera host) playing the curator, who introduced three tales of the [[macabre]], unveiling canvases that would appear in the subsequent story segments. Its brief first season (consisting of only six episodes) was rotated with three other shows airing in the same time slot; this [[wheel show]] was entitled ''[[Four in One]]''. The series generally focused more on [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]] than ''The Twilight Zone'' did. On the insistence of the producer [[Jack Laird]], ''Night Gallery'' also began including brief comedic [[blackout sketch|\"blackout\" sketches]] during its [[List of Night Gallery episodes#Season 2 .281971.E2.80.9372.29|second season]], which Serling greatly disdained.<ref name=\"tour\">{{cite book|last1=Skelton|first1=Scott|last2=Benson|first2=Jim|title=Rod Serling's Night Gallery: An After-Hours Tour|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8156-2782-1}}</ref> He stated \"I thought they [the blackout sketches] distorted the thread of what we were trying to do on ''Night Gallery''.

By season three, however, many of his contributions were being rejected or heavily altered.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''Night Gallery'' was cancelled in 1973. NBC later combined episodes of the short-lived [[paranormal]] series ''[[The Sixth Sense (TV series)|The Sixth Sense]]'' with ''Night Gallery'', in order to increase the number of episodes available in syndication.

CBS asked Serling to have more action and less character interaction. He refused to comply, even though the show had received poor reviews and low ratings.<ref name=Scribner/>\n\nIn a stylistic departure from his earlier work, Serling briefly hosted the first version of the game show ''[[Liar's Club]]'' in 1969.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010. 2nd ed.|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC|publisher = McFarland|date = 2008-11-06|isbn = 9780786486410|language = en|first = Vincent|last = Terrace|page = 598}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Serling appeared in television commercials for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Ziebart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ziebart.com/about/corporate-info/about-us|title=About Us |website=Ziebart}}</ref> and the Japanese automaker [[Mazda]], during the time they were promoting vehicles for the U.S. market powered with a [[Wankel engine|rotary engine]]. He also made very occasional minor acting appearances, all in material he didn't write. Serling appeared more-or-less as a version of himself (but named \"Mr. Zone\") in a comedic bit on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''; he appears in a 1962 episode of the short-lived sitcom ''[[Ichabod and Me]]'' in the role of Eugene Hollinfield; and in a 1972 episode of the crime drama ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]'' entitled \"Bubble, Bubble, Toil, and Murder\" (which also featured a young [[Jodie Foster]]), in which he plays a small role as the proprietor of an occult magic shop.\n\n===Other radio===\n\n====''The Zero Hour''====\nSerling returned to radio late in his career with ''[[The Zero Hour (U.S. radio series)|The Zero Hour]]'' (also known as ''Hollywood Radio Theater'') in 1973. The drama anthology series featured tales of mystery, adventure, and suspense, airing in stereo for two seasons. Serling hosted the program and wrote some of the scripts.\n\nOriginally placed into syndication on September 3, 1973, the series was picked up by the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] in December of that year. The original format featured five-part dramas broadcast Monday through Friday, with the story coming to a conclusion on Friday. Including commercials, each part was approximately 30 minutes long. Mutual affiliates could broadcast the series in any time slot that they wished.\n\nIn 1974, still airing five days a week, the program changed to a full story in a single 30-minute installment with the same actor starring throughout the week in all five programs. That format was employed from late April 1974 to the end of the series on July 26, 1974.\n\n====''Fantasy Park''====\nSerling's final radio performance, which he recorded just a few weeks before his death, was even more unusual: ''Fantasy Park'' was a 48-hour-long rock concert aired by nearly 200 stations over [[Labor Day]] weekend in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelradio.com/bw/index.html |title=The Beau Weaver Collection |publisher=[[Reel Top 40 Radio Repository|ReelRadio]] |quote= Fantasy Park Demo, KNUS Dallas, 1975&nbsp;... a 48 hour radio special hosted by Rod Serling&nbsp;...|accessdate=September 6, 2013| archivedate=January 14, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114103033/http://www.reelradio.com/bw/index.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The program, produced by [[KNUS]] in [[Dallas]], featured performances by dozens of rock stars of the day, and even reunited the [[Beatles]]. It was also completely ''imaginary'', a \"theatre-of-the-mind for the 70s\", as producer [[Beau Weaver]] put it, using record albums recorded live in concert, plus crowd noise and other sound effects. (Stations who aired the special were reportedly inundated by callers demanding to know how to get to the nonexistent concert.) KNUS general manager Bart McLendon recruited Serling (his old teacher) to record the host segments, bumpers, custom promos, and television spots.\n\nSerling wrote the disclaimers, which aired each hour: \"Hello, this is Rod Serling and welcome back to ''Fantasy Park''\u2014the crowds here today are unreal.\" \"This is ''Fantasy Park''\u2014the greatest live concert\u2014''never'' held.\"\n\n===Teaching===\nSerling kept his schedule full. When he was not writing, promoting, or producing his work, he often spoke on college campuses around the country.<ref name=Rosenbaum/> He taught week-long seminars in which students would watch and critique films. In the political climate of the 1960s, he often felt a stronger connection to the older students in his evening classes.<ref name=Rosenbaum/> Serling's critique of high school student writing was a pivotal experience for writer [[J.

Desiring to take a break and clear his mind, he took a one-year teaching job as writer in residence at Antioch College, Ohio. He taught classes in the 1962\u201363 school year on writing and drama and a survey course covering the \"social and historical implications of the media.\"<ref name=CAO/><ref name=Scribner/> He used this time to teach as well as work on a new screenplay, ''[[Seven Days in May]]''.<ref name=Scribner/>\n\nLater he taught at [[Ithaca College]], from the late 1960s until his death in 1975.<ref name=CAO/><ref name=Memorial>{{cite news | title = Serling Memorial Monday | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70D13FD3B58157493C3A9178CD85F418785F9 | agency = [[United Press International]] | work =[[The New York Times]] | date= July 1, 1975 | page= 32 | accessdate = September 16, 2013}} Abstract of pay-site article.</ref> He was one of the first guest teachers at the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College in Hollywood, California.

Just drawing back and drawing in, becoming narcissistic.\"<ref name=Rosenbaum/> This philosophy can be seen in his writing. Some themes appear again and again in his writing, many of which are concerned with war and politics. Another common theme is equality among all people.\n\n===Antiwar activism===\nSerling's experiences as a soldier left him with strong opinions about the use of military force. He was an outspoken antiwar activist, especially during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=Scribner/> He supported antiwar politicians, notably [[Eugene McCarthy]] in his [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential campaign in 1968]].<ref name=Scribner/>\n\n\"The Rack\" is an example of Serling's use of television to speak his mind on political issues. This script for ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' tells the story of an army captain charged with collaborating with the North Koreans. ''The New York Times'' reviewer J. P. Shanley called it \"controversial and compelling\".<ref name=shanley /> Serling tackled a question that was much in the media at the time: should veterans be charged with a crime if they cooperated with the enemy while under duress? In this courtroom drama the accused is put on trial for helping the enemy by urging fellow [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to cooperate with their captors. Serling offers many valid arguments on behalf of both the defense and the prosecution. Each has a strong case, but in the end, the captain is found guilty. There is no Serling narration to conclude the drama, as he had become famous for in ''The Twilight Zone''\u2014instead, the audience is left to make their own conclusions after the verdict has been rendered.<ref name=shanley>{{Citation |last=Shanley |first= J.

It told of a place that no longer celebrated Christmas, although none of the residents know why it has been canceled. Meanwhile, at the North Pole, the audience sees Santa Claus dealing with striking elves. Rather than creating toys and candy, the North Pole manufactures a diversity of bombs and offensive gases. Santa has been shot at on his route, and an elf was hit by shrapnel.<ref name=Grams/>\n\n\"24 Men to a Plane\" recounts Serling's first combat jump into the area around Manila in 1945. The combat jump became a fiasco after the jumpmaster in the first plane dropped his men too early, causing every subsequent plane to drop in synchronization with the mistake.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|48}}\n\n===Racial equality===\n''A Town Has Turned to Dust'' received a positive review from the critic [[Jack Gould]], who was known for being straightforward to the point of being harsh in his reviews. He called ''A Town Has Turned to Dust,'' \"a raw, tough and at the same time deeply moving outcry against prejudice.\"<ref name=Gould1958/> Set in a Southwestern town in a deep [[drought]], it sees poverty and despair turn racial tensions deadly when the ineffectual sheriff is unable to stand against the town. A young Mexican boy is lynched, and the town as a whole is to blame. A second lynching is in the works after a series of events leads again to the town turning against the Mexicans. This time, the sheriff stands strong, and the first boy's brother is saved, even as the town is not. \"Mr. Serling incorporated his protest against prejudice in vivid dialogue and sound situations. He made his point that hate for a fellow being leads only to the ultimate destruction of the bigoted.\"<ref name=Gould1958/>\n\nSerling took his 1972 screenplay for the film, [[The Man (Wallace novel)|''The Man'']], from the [[Irving Wallace]] novel of the same title. The black senator from [[New Hampshire]] and president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate, played by [[James Earl Jones]], assumes the U.S. presidency by succession.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Rod Serling Memorial-2.png|thumb|A memorial in honor of Serling in his home town of Binghamton, New York]]\nSerling was said to smoke three to four packs of cigarettes a day.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/29/archives/rod-serling-of-twilight-zone-and-night-gallery-on-tv-dies-won-six.html | title=Rod Serling of 'Twilight Zone' and 'Night Gallery' on TV Dies| newspaper=The New York Times| date=June 29, 1975| last1=Hudson| first1=Edward}}</ref> On May 3, 1975, he had a minor [[heart attack]] and was hospitalized.

The first public viewing of an all-electronic television was presented by inventor [[Philo Farnsworth]] at the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934, when Serling was nine years old. Commercial television officially started on July 1, 1941. At the time, there were fewer than seven thousand television sets in the United States, and very few of those were in private homes.<ref name=McMahon2007/>{{rp|21}} Only five months later, the U.S. entered World War II, and the television business was put on hold until the war's end,<ref name=McMahon2007/>{{rp|22}} as many of the sets were confiscated by the government and repurposed to train air-raid wardens.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|57}} After World War II ended, money began flowing toward the new medium of television, coinciding with the beginning of Serling's writing career. Early programming consisted of newsreels, sporting events and what would be called [[public-access television]] today. It was not until 1948 that filmed dramas were first shown, beginning with a show called ''[[Public Prosecutor (TV series)|Public Prosecutor]]''.<ref name=McMahon2007/>{{rp|25}} Serling began having serious dramas produced in 1950 and is given credit as one of the first to write scripts specifically for television. As such, he is said to have helped legitimize television drama.<ref name=Sander1992/>{{rp|28}}\n\nSerling worried that television was on the verge of suffering the same decline as radio. He encouraged sponsors to see television as a platform for the kind of dramatic entertainment that could address important social matters through subtle meanings, instead of being \"an animated billboard.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Brian|date=Winter 2016|title=The Enduring Legacy of \"The Twilight Zone\"|journal=The New Atlantis|volume=48|issue=48|pages=90\u2013112|jstor=43766985}}</ref>\n\nThe format of writing for television was changing rapidly in the early years, but eventually, it settled into a pattern of commercial breaks on each quarter-hour. Writers were forced to work these breaks into their scripts. Serling's response to this convention was, \"How can you put out a meaningful drama when every fifteen minutes proceedings are interrupted by twelve dancing rabbits with toilet paper? No dramatic art form should be dictated and controlled by men whose training and instincts are cut of an entirely different cloth. The fact remains that these gentlemen sell consumer goods, not an art form.\"<ref name=\"AmericanMasters\" /> Throughout his career Serling helped to mold the future of television.\n\n====Writing for multiple media====\nAs early as 1955, Jack Gould, of the ''New York Times'', commented on the close ties that were then being created between television and movies. Serling was among the first to use both forms, turning his early television successes, \"Patterns\" and \"The Rack\", into full-length movies.<ref name=gould>Gould, Jack. \"Some Reason for Optimism\". ''New York Times'', April 24, 1955. p. X11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: ''New York Times'' (1851\u20132006).</ref> Up to that time, many established writers were unwilling to write for television because the programs were viewed only once and then stored in a vault, never to be seen again.<ref name=Twice>Gould, Jack. \"TV: Twice-Told Tale\". ''New York Times'', February 11, 1955. p. 31. ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''New York Times'' (1851\u20132006)</ref>\n\n====Beginning of the rerun====\nAfter the first showing of \"Patterns\", the studio received such positive feedback that it produced a repeat performance, the first time a television program had been replayed at the request of the audience. Although successful shows had sometimes been recreated after two years or more, this was the first time a show was recreated exactly&nbsp;\u2014 with the same cast and crew&nbsp;\u2014 as it had been originally broadcast.<ref>Adams, Val. \"Kraft to Repeat 'Patterns' on TV\". ''New York Times'', January 20, 1955. p. 38. ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''New York Times'' (1851\u20132006).</ref> The second live performance, only a month later, was equally successful and inspired ''New York Times'' critic Jack Gould to write an essay on the use of replays on television. He stated that \"Patterns\" was a prime example of a drama that should be seen more than once, whereas a single broadcast was the norm for television shows of the day. Sponsors believed that creating new shows every week would assure them the largest possible audience, so they purchased a new script for each night. Gould suggested that as new networks were opened and the viewers were given more choices, the percentage of viewers would spread among the offerings. \"Patterns\" was proof that a second showing could gain more viewers because those who missed the first showing could see the second, thus increasing the audience for sponsors.<ref name=Twice/>\n\n==Effects on popular culture==\n\n===During his lifetime===\nIn December 1966, the made-for-television movie ''The Doomsday Flight'' aired. The fictional plot concerned an airplane with a bomb aboard. If the plane landed without the ransom money being paid, the aircraft would explode. The bomb was set with an altitude trigger that would detonate it if the plane dropped below four thousand feet. The show was one of the highest-rated of the television season, but both Serling and his brother Robert, a technical advisor on the project (a specialist in aviation), regretted making the film. After the film was aired, a rash of copycats telephoned in ransom demands to most of the largest airlines. Serling was truly devastated by what his script had encouraged. He told reporters who flocked to interview him, \"I wish to Christ that I had written a stagecoach drama starring John Wayne instead.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=John |authorlink1=John E.

It has been released in comic book form, as a magazine, a [[Twilight Zone: The Movie|film]], and three additional television series from [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|1985 to 1989]], from [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002 to 2003]], and again in [[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|2019]]. In 1988, [[J. Michael Straczynski]] scripted Serling's outline \"Our Selena Is Dying\" for the 1980s ''Twilight Zone'' revival.\n\nSome of Serling's works are now available in [[graphic novel]]s. ''Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone'' is a series of adaptations by Mark Kneece and Rich Ellis based on original scripts written by Serling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kneece |first=Mark |year=2009 |title=Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone: The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Walker & Company]] |isbn=978-0-8027-9713-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802797131/page/1 1] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802797131/page/1 }}</ref> Several episodes were adapted into novel form for pulp fiction books by Serling himself.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' is not the only Serling work to reappear. In 1994, ''[[Rod Serling's Lost Classics]]'' released two never-before-seen works that Carol Serling found in her garage. The first was an outline called, \"The Theatre\", that Richard Matheson expanded. The second was a complete script written by Serling, \"Where the Dead Are\".\n\nIn 1975, the Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] dedicated its third studio album, ''[[Caress of Steel]]'', to Serling. Its fourth album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', includes a song entitled \"[[The Twilight Zone (Rush song)|The Twilight Zone]]\", in which the two verses are each based on an episode of the series.<ref>https://www.songfacts.com/facts/rush/the-twilight-zone</ref>\n\nSerling and his work on ''The Twilight Zone'' inspired the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme park]] attraction, [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]], which debuted at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in Florida in 1994. Voice actor Mark Silverman provides the dubbing of Serling's dialogue for the attraction at both Hollywood Studios and [[Disney California Adventure]] in [[Anaheim]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocresort.ocregister.com/2011/01/17/tower-of-terrors-rod-serling-voice-speaks/67160/ |title=Tower of Terror's Rod Serling voice speaks |work=[[Orange County Register]] |last=Eades |first=Mark |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=September 6, 2013|archivedate= July 21, 2013| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130721142819/http://ocresort.ocregister.com/2011/01/17/tower-of-terrors-rod-serling-voice-speaks/67160/}}</ref> The ride takes place in the once-elegant Hollywood Tower Hotel that was struck by lightning, which caused the mysterious disappearance of five guests.

Filmed partially in [[3D film|3-D]], it opened with Serling's introducing the episode and instructing viewers when to put on their 3-D glasses. This was accomplished using footage from ''The Twilight Zone'' episode \"[[The Midnight Sun]]\" and digitally manipulating Serling's mouth to match new dialogue spoken by voice actor Mark Silverman. The plot involved paintings coming to life, a nod to both ''The Twilight Zone'' and ''Night Gallery''.\n\nOn August 11, 2009, the [[United States Postal Service]] released its ''Early TV Memories'' commemorative stamp collection honoring notable television programs.

Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\n\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine.

Europe became the third consumer market, where it launched in March 2009. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases is due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centers where the car is serviced.\n\nThe engines are hand built by only four specially trained mechanics called \"Takumi Craftsmens\" on a special line at Nissan's Yokohama plant and their names are badged on every GT-R engine.

Directed by [[Boris Sagal]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Barry Shear]], the film consists of three [[supernatural]] tales that served as the [[television pilot|pilot]] for the [[Night Gallery|anthology television series of the same name]], written and hosted by [[Rod Serling]]. The film originally premiered on [[NBC]] on November 8, 1969.<ref>[http://nightgallery.net/night-gallery-episode-guide-the-pilot ''Night Gallery: The Pilot''], nightgallery.net; accessed February 10, 2017.</ref>\n\nSerling appeared in an [[art gallery]] setting as the curator and introduced a trilogy of supernatural tales by unveiling paintings (by artist Jaroslav \"Jerry\" Gebr) that depicted the stories. The original theme was composed by [[Billy Goldenberg|William Goldenberg]] (who also did the pilot's background music).<ref>[http://nightgallery.net/the-paintings-pilot-and-season-1/ ''Night Gallery: The Paintings''] at nightgallery.net.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n===\"The Cemetery\"===\nThe first segment is directed by [[Boris Sagal]] with the opening narration by Serling:\n\n{{quote|''Good evening, and welcome to a private showing of three paintings, displayed here for the first time. Each is a collector's item in its own way\u2014not because of any special artistic quality, but because each captures on a canvas, suspends in time and space, a frozen moment of a nightmare. Our initial offering: a small gothic item in blacks and grays, a piece of the past known as the family crypt. This one we call, simply, \"The Cemetery.\" Offered to you now, six feet of earth and all that it contains. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Night Gallery...''}}\n\nJeremy Evans is a despicable selfish young man who murders his wealthy uncle in order to inherit his estate, both much to the detriment of his uncle's loyal butler, Osmond Portifoy. Shortly afterwards, Jeremy notices that a painting of the family graveyard has changed \u2013 a fresh, empty grave appears in it and soon after a coffin standing upright appears in the grave. Little by little, the painting depicts the return of his uncle from his burial site, moving closer and closer \u2013 or so it seems to Jeremy. Eventually, as someone pounds on the door, he goes mad, grabs the painting of his uncle as he protests that \"You're dead!\" and tumbles down the stairs to his death. The door opens to reveal Osmond, who - as is later revealed - orchestrated the whole thing. An artist friend of his created all the paintings, although it's never explained how he was able to switch out the final ones with Jeremy there watching! Osmond also reveals that a clause in his employer's will states that if there are no living heirs, he gets everything. Finally, as he looks at the painting of his boss and tells him to \"rest in peace\" he notices the same painting of the family cemetery. Just as before, a fresh grave appears, then a coffin, then Jeremy is seen in it, and finally comes the same pounding to the door. As he collapses in fear on the floor, the door swings open, and the screen fades to black.\n\n;Cast\n*[[Roddy McDowall]] as Jeremy Evans\n*[[Ossie Davis]] as Osmond Portifoy\n*[[George Macready]] as William Hendricks\n*[[Barry Atwater]] as Mr. Carson\n\n===\"Eyes\"===\nThe second segment is directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] with the opening narration:\n\n{{quote|''Objet d'art number two: a portrait. Its subject, Miss Claudia Menlo, a blind queen who reigns in a carpeted penthouse on Fifth Avenue\u2014an imperious, predatory dowager who will soon find a darkness blacker than blindness. This is her story...''}}\n\nClaudia Menlo is a heartless wealthy blind woman who desperately wants to be able to see. A hapless gambler owing money to loan sharks agrees to donate his eyes to her for the grand sum of $9,000 (approximately $63,700 in 2019 dollars). Her doctor, whom she blackmails into performing the illegal surgery, warns her that her vision will only last for about eleven hours. After the surgery, Claudia sits in her penthouse apartment with all her art and special possessions gathered around her so she can see them the moment her sight is restored. She removes the bandages from her eyes, and by a quirk of fate, there is a blackout seconds later. Thinking Dr. Heatherton has betrayed her, she stumbles down the long flights of stairs to the ground floor, cursing him with every step, and then collapses in an alley. The camera swings above a fence to show people on a nearby street, and a cop explains about the power failure. She awakens the next day, somehow back in her apartment, and sees the sunrise, but panics when her sight quickly begins to fade. Beating on the window, the glass cracks, and the scene cuts to black.\n\n;Cast\n*[[Joan Crawford]] as Claudia Menlo\n*[[Barry Sullivan (American actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Dr. Frank Heatherton\n*[[Tom Bosley]] as Sidney Resnick\n*[[Byron Morrow]] as George Packer\n\n===\"The Escape Route\"===\nThe third and final segment is directed by [[Barry Shear]] with the opening narration:\n\n{{quote|''And now, the final painting. The last of our exhibit has to do with one Joseph Strobe, a Nazi war criminal hiding in South America\u2014a monster who wanted to be a fisherman. This is his story...''}}\n\nJoseph Strobe is a Nazi fugitive constantly on the run from the authorities and his nightmares about the past. One day, while fleeing from imaginary pursuers, he finds himself in a museum where he meets Bleum, a survivor of the same concentration camp where Strobe made the decisions about who would live or die. Bleum does not initially recognize him, but points out a painting that depicts a man being crucified in a concentration camp and states that a friend of his died that way. Strobe turns away; he is drawn to a painting of a fisherman, and imagines himself in the painting. He finds happiness and peace there, fishing and gently drifting along the river. When Strobe returns to the art gallery the next day, Bleum recognizes him as a Nazi, and later, Strobe kills him to ensure his own anonymity. Once again, Strobe must hide from authorities. When caught, he tries to bargain for his freedom by offering knowledge on other war criminals. He manages to break free of the police, and in a state of desperation he returns to the museum and prays to be allowed into the painting. The corner where the painting hangs is dark, he hears chanting and cries out in fear, and disappears. The police arrive and search, but can't find him. One steps up to the corner with a man from the museum and asks about the fisherman painting. The man explains that it was taken down that day and replaced with the one they're looking at: the crucified man! They move away, yet hear moans of pain, but can't figure out where they're coming from.

Each is a collector's item in its own way\u2014not because of any special artistic quality, but because each captures on a canvas, suspends in time and space, a frozen moment of a nightmare. Our initial offering: a small gothic item in blacks and grays, a piece of the past known as the family crypt. This one we call, simply, \"The Cemetery.\" Offered to you now, six feet of earth and all that it contains. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Night Gallery...''}}\n\nJeremy Evans is a despicable selfish young man who murders his wealthy uncle in order to inherit his estate, both much to the detriment of his uncle's loyal butler, Osmond Portifoy. Shortly afterwards, Jeremy notices that a painting of the family graveyard has changed \u2013 a fresh, empty grave appears in it and soon after a coffin standing upright appears in the grave. Little by little, the painting depicts the return of his uncle from his burial site, moving closer and closer \u2013 or so it seems to Jeremy. Eventually, as someone pounds on the door, he goes mad, grabs the painting of his uncle as he protests that \"You're dead!\" and tumbles down the stairs to his death. The door opens to reveal Osmond, who - as is later revealed - orchestrated the whole thing. An artist friend of his created all the paintings, although it's never explained how he was able to switch out the final ones with Jeremy there watching! Osmond also reveals that a clause in his employer's will states that if there are no living heirs, he gets everything. Finally, as he looks at the painting of his boss and tells him to \"rest in peace\" he notices the same painting of the family cemetery. Just as before, a fresh grave appears, then a coffin, then Jeremy is seen in it, and finally comes the same pounding to the door. As he collapses in fear on the floor, the door swings open, and the screen fades to black.\n\n;Cast\n*[[Roddy McDowall]] as Jeremy Evans\n*[[Ossie Davis]] as Osmond Portifoy\n*[[George Macready]] as William Hendricks\n*[[Barry Atwater]] as Mr. Carson\n\n===\"Eyes\"===\nThe second segment is directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] with the opening narration:\n\n{{quote|''Objet d'art number two: a portrait.

A hapless gambler owing money to loan sharks agrees to donate his eyes to her for the grand sum of $9,000 (approximately $63,700 in 2019 dollars). Her doctor, whom she blackmails into performing the illegal surgery, warns her that her vision will only last for about eleven hours. After the surgery, Claudia sits in her penthouse apartment with all her art and special possessions gathered around her so she can see them the moment her sight is restored. She removes the bandages from her eyes, and by a quirk of fate, there is a blackout seconds later. Thinking Dr. Heatherton has betrayed her, she stumbles down the long flights of stairs to the ground floor, cursing him with every step, and then collapses in an alley. The camera swings above a fence to show people on a nearby street, and a cop explains about the power failure. She awakens the next day, somehow back in her apartment, and sees the sunrise, but panics when her sight quickly begins to fade. Beating on the window, the glass cracks, and the scene cuts to black.\n\n;Cast\n*[[Joan Crawford]] as Claudia Menlo\n*[[Barry Sullivan (American actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Dr. Frank Heatherton\n*[[Tom Bosley]] as Sidney Resnick\n*[[Byron Morrow]] as George Packer\n\n===\"The Escape Route\"===\nThe third and final segment is directed by [[Barry Shear]] with the opening narration:\n\n{{quote|''And now, the final painting. The last of our exhibit has to do with one Joseph Strobe, a Nazi war criminal hiding in South America\u2014a monster who wanted to be a fisherman. This is his story...''}}\n\nJoseph Strobe is a Nazi fugitive constantly on the run from the authorities and his nightmares about the past. One day, while fleeing from imaginary pursuers, he finds himself in a museum where he meets Bleum, a survivor of the same concentration camp where Strobe made the decisions about who would live or die. Bleum does not initially recognize him, but points out a painting that depicts a man being crucified in a concentration camp and states that a friend of his died that way. Strobe turns away; he is drawn to a painting of a fisherman, and imagines himself in the painting. He finds happiness and peace there, fishing and gently drifting along the river. When Strobe returns to the art gallery the next day, Bleum recognizes him as a Nazi, and later, Strobe kills him to ensure his own anonymity. Once again, Strobe must hide from authorities. When caught, he tries to bargain for his freedom by offering knowledge on other war criminals. He manages to break free of the police, and in a state of desperation he returns to the museum and prays to be allowed into the painting.
