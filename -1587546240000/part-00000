Opened 19 July 1975, the resort includes Gardaland Park, Gardaland Sea-Life, and the Gardaland Hotel. It is adjacent to [[Lake Garda]], but does not actually face the water. The entire complex covers an area of {{convert|445000|m\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}, while the theme park alone measures {{convert|200000|m\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. Sporting both traditional attractions and entertainment shows, it attracts nearly 3 million visitors every year.\n\nIn June 2005, Gardaland was ranked fifth in the top ten amusement parks in the world with the best turnover by Forbes Magazine, and according to 2011 data is the eighth in Europe by number of park visitors{{citation needed|reason=What data?|date=July 2015}}.\n\nSince October 2006, the park has been owned by the British company [[Merlin Entertainments]].

There are at least 39 different installations across the world. The minimum rider height requirement is {{convert|130|cm|ftin}}. In 2020 Vekoma will open their new [[Suspended Thrill Coaster]] which is the successor to the Suspended Looping Coaster.\n\n==History==\nThe first Suspended Looping Coaster installation was [[El Condor (roller coaster)|El Condor]] at [[Walibi Holland]] in the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"El Condor\"/> It was initially designed to run with ten cars in each train. Trouble with this configuration lead to the trains being shortened to eight cars to a train.<ref name=\"662m Prototype\">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=SLC|location=662m Prototype|rcdb_number=8409|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> [[T2 (roller coaster)|T3]] at [[Kentucky Kingdom]] was the second prototype model Suspended Looping Coaster and the first in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"T3\">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=T3|location=Kentucky Kingdom|rcdb_number=175|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> Like El Condor, it was designed to run with ten cars in a train, though T3's trains were shortened to seven cars for similar reasons.<ref name=\"662m Prototype\" />\n\nThe roller coaster is considered to still be in production as the latest new installation (i.e. not relocated) was Queen Cobra at Sun World Danang Wonders in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, Vietnam which opened in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rcdb.com/r.htm?order=8&ot=2&ml=8106|title=Roller Coaster Search Results|website=rcdb.com|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Ride==\n\n===Layouts===\nThere are several different layouts of Suspended Looping Coasters although most feature a similar pattern.<ref name=\"662m Prototype\" /> The ride starts by taking riders up a {{Convert|33.3|m|ft|adj=on}} [[lift hill|chain hill]].<ref name=\"Lethal Weapon\"/> Once at the top, the train goes down a steep, banked turn to the right where it enters the first inversion element - a roll over. A roll over (also known as a [[Roller coaster elements#Sea serpent roll|Sea serpent roll]]) first features a Sidewinder quickly followed by a reverse sidewinder.<ref>{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Roll Over|rcdb_number=8889|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> Upon exit from this element, the train goes up a hill which features some banking at the top before descending and approaching the ride's next inversion - a sidewinder.<ref name=\"Lethal Weapon\"/> A sidewinder is similar to an [[Immelmann loop]] however it features a half loop followed by a half corkscrew (rather than an inline twist).<ref>{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Sidewinder|rcdb_number=8890|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> From the exit of this sidewinder, the train goes into a sharp helix before entering the ride's final two inversions - [[Roller coaster elements#Inline twist|inline twists]]. These two twists are followed one after the other. A banked curve to the right turns the train back around to face towards the station. At this point some models feature an additional helix to the left while others simply continue straight into the [[brake run]].<ref name=\"Lethal Weapon\"/> The standard model also has a relatively compact layout, providing for \"[[Roller coaster elements#Headchopper|footchoppers]]\".\n\nVekoma have also manufactured two custom Suspended Looping Coasters: [[Fly - The Great Nor'easter]] at [[Morey's Piers]] (which is really just a standard SLC with custom station and supports) and [[Jubilee Odyssey]] at [[Fantasy Island UK|Fantasy Island]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Marden|first=Duane|title=Roller Coaster Search Results - Model = SLC (Custom)|url=http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&mo=8294|publisher=Roller Coaster Database|work=Database Entry|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vekoma SLC 765m helix.svg|The 765m Extended w/Helix layout\nFile:Vekoma SLC 689m standard.svg|The 689m Standard, the layout of most Suspended Looping Coasters\nFile:Mind Eraser (Under Drop).JPG|Mind Eraser directly before the roll over\nFile:Mind Eraser (Sidewinder).JPG|Mind Eraser's signature roll over\nFile:Mind Eraser (Overbank).JPG|Mind Eraser directly before the sidewinder\nFile:Mind Eraser (Under Brake Run).JPG|Mind Eraser preparing to enter its brake run\nFile:Mind Eraser.jpg|[[Darien Lake]]'s Mind Eraser\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Poorly maintained, poor track layout or most likely non-exact track manufacturing can cause SLCs riders to experience notoriously painful \"head banging\", whereby the head hits the Over the Shoulder Restraints. They also use very small plastic seats with little or no room for a person to move. Contrary to popular belief, the wheel spacing on the [[train (roller coaster)|trains]] (the 'gaps' between the side friction wheels, up-stop wheels and the track) adds little to the roughness of these rides. Vekoma is currently manufacturing new trains with convenient hip harnesses. Unlike the first generation of trains, this modification will make the overall ride experience more comfortable. Vekoma also makes vest-like harnesses that allow to rider to sit more comfortably while riding.

One of them is Shenzhou Coaster, an inverted roller coaster at [[Beijing Shijingshan Amusement Park]] in [[Beijing, China]]. The train and track are similar to the Suspended Looping Coaster design by Vekoma, but the ride was instead designed and manufactured by Beijing Shibaolai Amusement Equipment. There have been several problems with other models with the same layout, most notably bad pacing in parts of the ride. For example, the \"Hanging Roller Coaster\" at Crab Island stalled before its sidewinder element, stranding 12 people for over 3 hours. Other SLC's in China are sometimes manufactured by Hebei Zhongye Metallurgical Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which are known for being more poor than the Beijing Shibaolai models. HZM have tried to smooth out the transitions but the rides experience has not improved.

There are at least 39 different installations across the world. The minimum rider height requirement is {{convert|130|cm|ftin}}. In 2020 Vekoma will open their new [[Suspended Thrill Coaster]] which is the successor to the Suspended Looping Coaster.\n\n==History==\nThe first Suspended Looping Coaster installation was [[El Condor (roller coaster)|El Condor]] at [[Walibi Holland]] in the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"El Condor\"/> It was initially designed to run with ten cars in each train. Trouble with this configuration lead to the trains being shortened to eight cars to a train.<ref name=\"662m Prototype\">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=SLC|location=662m Prototype|rcdb_number=8409|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> [[T2 (roller coaster)|T3]] at [[Kentucky Kingdom]] was the second prototype model Suspended Looping Coaster and the first in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"T3\">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=T3|location=Kentucky Kingdom|rcdb_number=175|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> Like El Condor, it was designed to run with ten cars in a train, though T3's trains were shortened to seven cars for similar reasons.<ref name=\"662m Prototype\" />\n\nThe roller coaster is considered to still be in production as the latest new installation (i.e. not relocated) was Queen Cobra at Sun World Danang Wonders in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, Vietnam which opened in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rcdb.com/r.htm?order=8&ot=2&ml=8106|title=Roller Coaster Search Results|website=rcdb.com|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Ride==\n\n===Layouts===\nThere are several different layouts of Suspended Looping Coasters although most feature a similar pattern.<ref name=\"662m Prototype\" /> The ride starts by taking riders up a {{Convert|33.3|m|ft|adj=on}} [[lift hill|chain hill]].<ref name=\"Lethal Weapon\"/> Once at the top, the train goes down a steep, banked turn to the right where it enters the first inversion element - a roll over. A roll over (also known as a [[Roller coaster elements#Sea serpent roll|Sea serpent roll]]) first features a Sidewinder quickly followed by a reverse sidewinder.<ref>{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Roll Over|rcdb_number=8889|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> Upon exit from this element, the train goes up a hill which features some banking at the top before descending and approaching the ride's next inversion - a sidewinder.<ref name=\"Lethal Weapon\"/> A sidewinder is similar to an [[Immelmann loop]] however it features a half loop followed by a half corkscrew (rather than an inline twist).<ref>{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Sidewinder|rcdb_number=8890|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref> From the exit of this sidewinder, the train goes into a sharp helix before entering the ride's final two inversions - [[Roller coaster elements#Inline twist|inline twists]]. These two twists are followed one after the other. A banked curve to the right turns the train back around to face towards the station. At this point some models feature an additional helix to the left while others simply continue straight into the [[brake run]].<ref name=\"Lethal Weapon\"/> The standard model also has a relatively compact layout, providing for \"[[Roller coaster elements#Headchopper|footchoppers]]\".\n\nVekoma have also manufactured two custom Suspended Looping Coasters: [[Fly - The Great Nor'easter]] at [[Morey's Piers]] (which is really just a standard SLC with custom station and supports) and [[Jubilee Odyssey]] at [[Fantasy Island UK|Fantasy Island]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Marden|first=Duane|title=Roller Coaster Search Results - Model = SLC (Custom)|url=http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&mo=8294|publisher=Roller Coaster Database|work=Database Entry|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vekoma SLC 765m helix.svg|The 765m Extended w/Helix layout\nFile:Vekoma SLC 689m standard.svg|The 689m Standard, the layout of most Suspended Looping Coasters\nFile:Mind Eraser (Under Drop).JPG|Mind Eraser directly before the roll over\nFile:Mind Eraser (Sidewinder).JPG|Mind Eraser's signature roll over\nFile:Mind Eraser (Overbank).JPG|Mind Eraser directly before the sidewinder\nFile:Mind Eraser (Under Brake Run).JPG|Mind Eraser preparing to enter its brake run\nFile:Mind Eraser.jpg|[[Darien Lake]]'s Mind Eraser\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Poorly maintained, poor track layout or most likely non-exact track manufacturing can cause SLCs riders to experience notoriously painful \"head banging\", whereby the head hits the Over the Shoulder Restraints. They also use very small plastic seats with little or no room for a person to move. Contrary to popular belief, the wheel spacing on the [[train (roller coaster)|trains]] (the 'gaps' between the side friction wheels, up-stop wheels and the track) adds little to the roughness of these rides. Vekoma is currently manufacturing new trains with convenient hip harnesses. Unlike the first generation of trains, this modification will make the overall ride experience more comfortable. Vekoma also makes vest-like harnesses that allow to rider to sit more comfortably while riding. The only three known places to have these trains are [[Morey's Piers]],<ref>http://viewer.zmags.co.uk/showmag.php?mid=gfsrf#/page22/</ref>, [[Isla Magica]] in Spain and Six Flags New England in Agawam, MA. In 2012, Lethal Weapon - The Ride at [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] reopened as [[Arkham Asylum - Shock Therapy]]. The newly opened ride runs with trains manufactured by [[Kumbak]] and uses less restrictive harnesses which are similar, but not identical to, the vest-like restraints found on the SLCs at Morey's Piers and Isla Magica.<ref>http://rcdb.com/1122.htm</ref>\n\nThe Suspended Looping Coaster is similar in design to other inverted roller coasters, however unlike the four-across seating found on [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] (B&M) inverted roller coasters, Vekoma SLC's use two-across seating.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kumalitrain.jpg|A Vekoma Suspended Looping Coaster train seats riders 2 across.\nFile:NemesisAlton.JPG|A [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] Inverted Roller Coaster train seats riders 4 across.\n</gallery>\n\n==Installations==\nThere are at least 42 different installations across the world which have been located at 48 different theme parks.<ref name=\"SLC\">{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=SLC|rcdb_number=8106|accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n<!--LIST IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

One of them is Shenzhou Coaster, an inverted roller coaster at [[Beijing Shijingshan Amusement Park]] in [[Beijing, China]]. The train and track are similar to the Suspended Looping Coaster design by Vekoma, but the ride was instead designed and manufactured by Beijing Shibaolai Amusement Equipment. There have been several problems with other models with the same layout, most notably bad pacing in parts of the ride. For example, the \"Hanging Roller Coaster\" at Crab Island stalled before its sidewinder element, stranding 12 people for over 3 hours. Other SLC's in China are sometimes manufactured by Hebei Zhongye Metallurgical Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which are known for being more poor than the Beijing Shibaolai models. HZM have tried to smooth out the transitions but the rides experience has not improved. None of these models can operate during winds in excess of 15&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Shenzhou Coaster|location=Beijing Shijingshan Amusement Park|rcdb_number=2906|accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.vekoma.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24&Itemid=16 Official website]\n*[http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&ml=8106 Listing of all Suspended Looping Coasters] on the [[Roller Coaster Database]]\n\n{{Vekoma}}\n\n[[Category:Steel roller coasters]]\n[[Category:Mass-produced roller coasters]]\n[[Category:Vekoma]]\n", "name_user": "Inwind", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_Looping_Coaster"}

Puligandla states it as \"the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world\",{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=222}} while Sinar states Brahman is a concept that \"cannot be exactly defined\".{{sfn|Sinari|2000|p=384}}\n\nIn [[Vedic Sanskrit]]:\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e) (nominative singular), ''br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>n'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d) (stem) (neuter<ref name=\"neuter\">Not Masculine or Feminine  (see [[Grammatical gender]]).</ref> [[gender]]) from root ''b\u1e5bh-'', means \"to be or make firm, strong, solid, expand, promote\".<ref name=jangondaetymo>[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 268\u2013269</ref>\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>n<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928) (nominative singular, never plural), from stems ''brh<u>a</u>'' (to make firm, strong, expand) + Sanskrit ''-man-'' from Indo-European root ''-men-'' which denotes some manifest form of \"definite power, inherent firmness, supporting or fundamental principle\".<ref name=jangondaetymo/>\n\nIn later Sanskrit usage:\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e) (nominative singular), ''brahman'' (stem) (neuter<ref name=\"neuter\" /> [[gender]]) means the concept of the transcendent and immanent ultimate reality, Supreme Cosmic Spirit in Hinduism. The concept is central to Hindu philosophy, especially Vedanta; this is discussed below. ''Brahm'' is another variant of ''Brahman''.\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm\u0101'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e) (nominative singlular), ''Brahman'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d) (stem) ([[masculine]] [[gender]]), means the deity or [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Brahma (god)|Praj\u0101pati Brahm\u0101]]. He is one of the members of the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]] and associated with creation, but does not have a cult in present-day India. This is because Brahm\u0101, the creator-god, is long-lived but not eternal i.e. Brahm\u0101 gets absorbed back into [[Purusha]] at the end of an aeon, and is born again at the beginning of a new [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]].\n\nThese are distinct from:\n* A ''br\u0101hm<u>a</u>\u1e47<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923) (masculine, pronounced {{IPA-sa|\u02c8b\u027da\u02d0\u0266m\u0250\u0273\u0250|}}), (which literally means \"pertaining to prayer\") is a prose commentary on the [[Veda|Vedic mantras]]\u2014an integral part of the Vedic literature.\n* A ''br\u0101hm<u>a</u>\u1e47<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923) (masculine, same pronunciation as above), means priest; in this usage the word is usually rendered in English as \"[[Brahmin]]\". This usage is also found in the [[Atharva Veda]]. In neuter plural form, Brahm\u0101\u1e47i. See [[Vedic priest]].\n* ''[[Ishvara]]'', (lit., Supreme Lord), in Advaita, is identified as a partial worldly manifestation (with limited attributes) of the ultimate reality, the attributeless Brahman. In [[Visishtadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]], however, Ishvara (the Supreme Controller) has infinite attributes and the source of the impersonal Brahman.\n* ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]'', the expansions of Brahman/God into various forms, each with a certain quality. In the Vedic religion, there were 33 devas, which later became exaggerated to 330 million devas. In fact, devas are themselves regarded as more mundane manifestations of the One and the Supreme Brahman (See [[Para Brahman]]). The Sanskrit word for \"ten million\" also means group, and 330 million devas originally meant 33 types of divine manifestations.\n\n==History and literature==\n\n===Vedic===\n''Brahman'' is a concept present in Vedic [[Samhita]]s, the oldest layer of the [[Vedas]] dated to the 2nd millennium BCE.

[[Teleology]] deals with the apparent purpose, principle or goal of something. In the first chapter of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], these questions are dealt with. It says :\n{{Quote|\n<poem>\n\"People who make inquiries about brahman say:\n\nWhat is the cause of Brahman? Why were we born? By what do we live? On what are we established? Governed by whom, O you who know Brahman, do we live in pleasure and in pain, each in our respective situation?\n</poem>\n|Svetashvatara Upanishad|Hymns 1.1<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hinduwebsite.com/sveta.asp|title=The Svetasvatara Upanishad, An Introduction|website=Hinduwebsite.com|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://estudantedavedanta.net/Svetasvatara_Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Tyagisananda%20%281949%29%20]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nThe main purpose of the Brahman and why it exists is a subjective question according to the [[Upanishads]]. One can only find out its true purpose when one becomes the Brahman as the 'Brahman' is all the knowledge one can know itself. Hence, complete answers for anything in life can only be determined or obtained when the Brahman is realized as the Brahman is all the complete knowledge itself. This is said in the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] 3.3 and [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4.4.17 and many other [[Upanishads]].\n\n{{Quote|\n<poem>\nKnowledge is the eye of all that, and on knowledge it is founded. Knowledge is the eye of the world, and knowledge, the foundation. Brahman is knowing.\n</poem>\n|Aitereya Upanishad|Hymns 3.3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-aitareya_upanishad.pdf|title=English translation of Aitareya Upanishad|website=Consciouslivingfoundation.org|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://esamskriti.com/essays/Aitareya-Upanishad.pdf|title=Aitareya Upanishad : Transliterated Sanskrit Text Free Translation & Brief Explanation|author=T.N. Sethumadhavan|website=Esamskriti.com|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nOne of the reasons to why the Brahman should be realized according to the Upanishads is because it removes suffering from a person's life. This is because the person has the ability and knowledge to discriminate between the unchanging (Atman and Brahman) and the ever-changing ([[Prakrit]]) and so the person is not attached to the transient. Hence, the person is only content with the self and not his body or anything other than the self.\n\nIn [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.9.26 it mentions that the atman 'neither trembles in fear nor suffers injury' and in the [[Isha Upanishad]] 6-7 it too talks about suffering as non existent when one becomes the Brahman as they see the self in all beings and all beings in the self. Therefore, the apparent purpose of Brahman is in discussion in the [[Upanishads]] but the Brahman itself is the only self-contained purpose and true goal according to the [[Upanishads]], so posing the question is redundant. The [[Upanishads]] consider the Brahman the only actual worthwhile goal in life and ultimately one should aim to become it as it is the means and an end in and of itself to ultimate knowledge, immortality, etc. So the question of what is the ultimate purpose of everything including the Brahman is answered by realizing or attaining the Brahman as the Brahman itself is ultimate knowledge. Hence, the Brahman is a teleological concept as it is the ultimate purpose and goal of everything possible and permeates everything and is in everything.\n\n===Brahman as a soteriological concept: Moksha===\n{{Main|Moksha}}\n\nThe orthodox schools of Hinduism, particularly Vedanta, Samkhya and Yoga schools, focus on the concept of Brahman and Atman in their discussion of [[moksha]]. The Advaita Vedanta holds there is no being/non-being distinction between Atman and Brahman. The knowledge of Atman (Self-knowledge) is synonymous to the knowledge of Brahman inside the person and outside the person. Furthermore, the knowledge of Brahman leads to a sense of oneness with all existence, self-realization, indescribable joy, and moksha (freedom, bliss),<ref>Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas'', University of Hawaii Press, pages 124\u2013125</ref> because Brahman-Atman is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone.<ref>Karl Potter (2008), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Ved\u0101nta Up to \u015aa\u1e43kara and His Pupils'', Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 210\u2013215</ref>\n\nThe theistic sub-school such as Dvaita Vedanta of Hinduism, starts with the same premises, but adds the premise that individual souls and Brahman are distinct, and thereby reaches entirely different conclusions where Brahman is conceptualized in a manner similar to God in other major world religions.<ref name=mmyers/> The theistic schools assert that moksha is the loving, eternal union or nearness of one's soul with the distinct and separate Brahman ([[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or equivalent henotheism). Brahman, in these sub-schools of Hinduism is considered the highest perfection of existence, which every soul journeys towards in its own way for moksha.<ref>Betty Stafford (2010) \"Dvaita, Advaita, And Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6dadvaita: Contrasting Views Of Mok\u1e63a\", ''Asian Philosophy'', pages 215\u2013224</ref>\n\n==Schools of thought==\n\n===Vedanta===\nThe concept of Brahman, its nature and its relationship with Atman and the observed universe, is a major point of difference between the various sub-schools of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.\n\n====Advaita Vedanta====\n{{Main|Advaita Vedanta}}\n{{Advaita}}\n[[Advaita Vedanta]] espouses [[nondualism]].

He states that Brahman can neither be taught nor perceived (as an object of intellectual knowledge), but it can be learned and realized by all human beings.<ref name=\"Arvind Sharma 2007 pages 19-40\"/> The goal of Advaita Vedanta is to realize that one's Self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') gets obscured by ignorance and false-identification (\"[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]\"). When Avidya is removed, the Atman (Soul, Self inside a person) is realized as identical with Brahman.<ref name=\"dx.doi.org\"/> The Brahman is not an outside, separate, dual entity, the Brahman is within each person, states Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. ''Brahman'' is all that is eternal, unchanging and that which truly exists.<ref name=acdas/> This view is stated in this school in many different forms, such as \"''Ekam sat''\" (\"Truth is one\"), and all is ''Brahman''.\n\nThe universe does not simply come from Brahman, it ''is'' Brahman. According to [[Adi Shankara]], a proponent of [[Advaita Vedanta]], the knowledge of Brahman that [[shruti]] provides cannot be obtained by any other means besides self inquiry.<ref>Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas.''

Puligandla states it as \"the unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world\",{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=222}} while Sinar states Brahman is a concept that \"cannot be exactly defined\".{{sfn|Sinari|2000|p=384}}\n\nIn [[Vedic Sanskrit]]:\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e) (nominative singular), ''br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>n'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d) (stem) (neuter<ref name=\"neuter\">Not Masculine or Feminine  (see [[Grammatical gender]]).</ref> [[gender]]) from root ''b\u1e5bh-'', means \"to be or make firm, strong, solid, expand, promote\".<ref name=jangondaetymo>[[Jan Gonda]] (1962), Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology, ''History of Religions'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 268\u2013269</ref>\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>n<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928) (nominative singular, never plural), from stems ''brh<u>a</u>'' (to make firm, strong, expand) + Sanskrit ''-man-'' from Indo-European root ''-men-'' which denotes some manifest form of \"definite power, inherent firmness, supporting or fundamental principle\".<ref name=jangondaetymo/>\n\nIn later Sanskrit usage:\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e) (nominative singular), ''brahman'' (stem) (neuter<ref name=\"neuter\" /> [[gender]]) means the concept of the transcendent and immanent ultimate reality, Supreme Cosmic Spirit in Hinduism. The concept is central to Hindu philosophy, especially Vedanta; this is discussed below. ''Brahm'' is another variant of ''Brahman''.\n* ''Br<u>a</u>hm\u0101'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e) (nominative singlular), ''Brahman'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d) (stem) ([[masculine]] [[gender]]), means the deity or [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Brahma (god)|Praj\u0101pati Brahm\u0101]]. He is one of the members of the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]] and associated with creation, but does not have a cult in present-day India. This is because Brahm\u0101, the creator-god, is long-lived but not eternal i.e. Brahm\u0101 gets absorbed back into [[Purusha]] at the end of an aeon, and is born again at the beginning of a new [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]].\n\nThese are distinct from:\n* A ''br\u0101hm<u>a</u>\u1e47<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923) (masculine, pronounced {{IPA-sa|\u02c8b\u027da\u02d0\u0266m\u0250\u0273\u0250|}}), (which literally means \"pertaining to prayer\") is a prose commentary on the [[Veda|Vedic mantras]]\u2014an integral part of the Vedic literature.\n* A ''br\u0101hm<u>a</u>\u1e47<u>a</u>'' (\u092c\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0923) (masculine, same pronunciation as above), means priest; in this usage the word is usually rendered in English as \"[[Brahmin]]\". This usage is also found in the [[Atharva Veda]]. In neuter plural form, Brahm\u0101\u1e47i. See [[Vedic priest]].\n* ''[[Ishvara]]'', (lit., Supreme Lord), in Advaita, is identified as a partial worldly manifestation (with limited attributes) of the ultimate reality, the attributeless Brahman. In [[Visishtadvaita]] and [[Dvaita]], however, Ishvara (the Supreme Controller) has infinite attributes and the source of the impersonal Brahman.\n* ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]'', the expansions of Brahman/God into various forms, each with a certain quality. In the Vedic religion, there were 33 devas, which later became exaggerated to 330 million devas. In fact, devas are themselves regarded as more mundane manifestations of the One and the Supreme Brahman (See [[Para Brahman]]). The Sanskrit word for \"ten million\" also means group, and 330 million devas originally meant 33 types of divine manifestations.\n\n==History and literature==\n\n===Vedic===\n''Brahman'' is a concept present in Vedic [[Samhita]]s, the oldest layer of the [[Vedas]] dated to the 2nd millennium BCE.

[[Teleology]] deals with the apparent purpose, principle or goal of something. In the first chapter of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], these questions are dealt with. It says :\n{{Quote|\n<poem>\n\"People who make inquiries about brahman say:\n\nWhat is the cause of Brahman? Why were we born? By what do we live? On what are we established? Governed by whom, O you who know Brahman, do we live in pleasure and in pain, each in our respective situation?\n</poem>\n|Svetashvatara Upanishad|Hymns 1.1<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hinduwebsite.com/sveta.asp|title=The Svetasvatara Upanishad, An Introduction|website=Hinduwebsite.com|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://estudantedavedanta.net/Svetasvatara_Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Tyagisananda%20%281949%29%20]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nThe main purpose of the Brahman and why it exists is a subjective question according to the [[Upanishads]]. One can only find out its true purpose when one becomes the Brahman as the 'Brahman' is all the knowledge one can know itself. Hence, complete answers for anything in life can only be determined or obtained when the Brahman is realized as the Brahman is all the complete knowledge itself. This is said in the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] 3.3 and [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4.4.17 and many other [[Upanishads]].\n\n{{Quote|\n<poem>\nKnowledge is the eye of all that, and on knowledge it is founded. Knowledge is the eye of the world, and knowledge, the foundation. Brahman is knowing.\n</poem>\n|Aitereya Upanishad|Hymns 3.3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-aitareya_upanishad.pdf|title=English translation of Aitareya Upanishad|website=Consciouslivingfoundation.org|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://esamskriti.com/essays/Aitareya-Upanishad.pdf|title=Aitareya Upanishad : Transliterated Sanskrit Text Free Translation & Brief Explanation|author=T.N. Sethumadhavan|website=Esamskriti.com|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nOne of the reasons to why the Brahman should be realized according to the Upanishads is because it removes suffering from a person's life. This is because the person has the ability and knowledge to discriminate between the unchanging (Atman and Brahman) and the ever-changing ([[Prakrit]]) and so the person is not attached to the transient. Hence, the person is only content with the self and not his body or anything other than the self.\n\nIn [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.9.26 it mentions that the atman 'neither trembles in fear nor suffers injury' and in the [[Isha Upanishad]] 6-7 it too talks about suffering as non existent when one becomes the Brahman as they see the self in all beings and all beings in the self. Therefore, the apparent purpose of Brahman is in discussion in the [[Upanishads]] but the Brahman itself is the only self-contained purpose and true goal according to the [[Upanishads]], so posing the question is redundant. The [[Upanishads]] consider the Brahman the only actual worthwhile goal in life and ultimately one should aim to become it as it is the means and an end in and of itself to ultimate knowledge, immortality, etc. So the question of what is the ultimate purpose of everything including the Brahman is answered by realizing or attaining the Brahman as the Brahman itself is ultimate knowledge. Hence, the Brahman is a teleological concept as it is the ultimate purpose and goal of everything possible and permeates everything and is in everything.\n\n===Brahman as a soteriological concept: Moksha===\n{{Main|Moksha}}\n\nThe orthodox schools of Hinduism, particularly Vedanta, Samkhya and Yoga schools, focus on the concept of Brahman and Atman in their discussion of [[moksha]]. The Advaita Vedanta holds there is no being/non-being distinction between Atman and Brahman. The knowledge of Atman (Self-knowledge) is synonymous to the knowledge of Brahman inside the person and outside the person. Furthermore, the knowledge of Brahman leads to a sense of oneness with all existence, self-realization, indescribable joy, and moksha (freedom, bliss),<ref>Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas'', University of Hawaii Press, pages 124\u2013125</ref> because Brahman-Atman is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone.<ref>Karl Potter (2008), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Ved\u0101nta Up to \u015aa\u1e43kara and His Pupils'', Volume 3, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp. 210\u2013215</ref>\n\nThe theistic sub-school such as Dvaita Vedanta of Hinduism, starts with the same premises, but adds the premise that individual souls and Brahman are distinct, and thereby reaches entirely different conclusions where Brahman is conceptualized in a manner similar to God in other major world religions.<ref name=mmyers/> The theistic schools assert that moksha is the loving, eternal union or nearness of one's soul with the distinct and separate Brahman ([[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] or equivalent henotheism). Brahman, in these sub-schools of Hinduism is considered the highest perfection of existence, which every soul journeys towards in its own way for moksha.<ref>Betty Stafford (2010) \"Dvaita, Advaita, And Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6dadvaita: Contrasting Views Of Mok\u1e63a\", ''Asian Philosophy'', pages 215\u2013224</ref>\n\n==Schools of thought==\n\n===Vedanta===\nThe concept of Brahman, its nature and its relationship with Atman and the observed universe, is a major point of difference between the various sub-schools of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism.\n\n====Advaita Vedanta====\n{{Main|Advaita Vedanta}}\n{{Advaita}}\n[[Advaita Vedanta]] espouses [[nondualism]].

He states that Brahman can neither be taught nor perceived (as an object of intellectual knowledge), but it can be learned and realized by all human beings.<ref name=\"Arvind Sharma 2007 pages 19-40\"/> The goal of Advaita Vedanta is to realize that one's Self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') gets obscured by ignorance and false-identification (\"[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]\"). When Avidya is removed, the Atman (Soul, Self inside a person) is realized as identical with Brahman.<ref name=\"dx.doi.org\"/> The Brahman is not an outside, separate, dual entity, the Brahman is within each person, states Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. ''Brahman'' is all that is eternal, unchanging and that which truly exists.<ref name=acdas/> This view is stated in this school in many different forms, such as \"''Ekam sat''\" (\"Truth is one\"), and all is ''Brahman''.\n\nThe universe does not simply come from Brahman, it ''is'' Brahman. According to [[Adi Shankara]], a proponent of [[Advaita Vedanta]], the knowledge of Brahman that [[shruti]] provides cannot be obtained by any other means besides self inquiry.<ref>Anantanand Rambachan (1994), ''The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas.''

He graduated with honors from gymnasium in December 1857, but only by autumn 1858 managed to enroll to the [[Saint Petersburg State University]], as he was still under the prescribed age of 16. He studied at the faculty of physics and mathematics and was nearly expelled in the autumn of 1861 due to some political disturbances. Nevertheless, by the spring of 1862 he attained the master's degree. During the last years he became interested in chemistry, which he studied under [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. While he acquired a sufficient knowledge of theory he was lacking practice, as at that time the entire laboratory of the university consisted of only two small rooms. Therefore, he went abroad, and in the following three years spent two semesters with [[Adolph Strecker]] at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], a year (1864\u20135) with [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]] at the [[University of Paris]], and a semester with [[Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe]] at the [[University of Marburg]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn the meantime, many changes were introduced into the constitution of the Russian universities. In 1863 the universities obtained academic freedom, they chose for themselves the professors,\ndeans, and rectors, at the same time the means of teaching improved, and, owing to Mendeleev\u2019s efforts, the laboratory at St. Petersburg University was enlarged. In 1865 Menshutkin returned to St. Petersburg, just after his PhD thesis was published in the ''Comptes Rendus'' of the French Academy under the title \u201cAction du chlorure d\u2019acetyle sur l\u2019acide phosphoreux\u201d. He defended it in March 1866 against [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] and Dmitri Mendeleev and in autumn began teaching a course on organic nitrogen compounds. On 6 April 1869, he defended his [[habilitation]] on \u201cThe Synthesis and Properties of the Ureides\u201d and shortly was appointed as professor of analytical chemistry. In connection with his teaching he proceeded to rearrange the course of instructions and in 1871 brought out his well-known textbook, which survived 16 editions up to 1931 and had been translated into German and English. In 1871, Menshutkin became secretary of the faculty of physics and mathematics and in 1879 was appointed as dean, an office which he held until 1887.<ref name=r1/>\n\nThe assassination of the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881 was followed by the adoption of severe measures, from the effects of which the universities suffered in many ways. The autonomy granted in 1863 was revoked and all officials could only be appointed by the Minister of Public Instruction; the admission of students was hindered by accepting them only from certain schools, the fees were raised and the number of professorships reduced. The discontent by professors and students resulted in disturbances in 1887-8, which were followed by the resignation of the rector and several key officials. As a result, Menshutkin had to add teaching of organic chemistry to his duties. About this time he prepared his large handbook of organic chemistry, which appeared in three successive editions, and in 1888 he published a history of the development of chemical theory. Both books were written in Russian and not translated. One of Menshutkin\u2019s most serious undertakings of the time was the building of the new chemical laboratories of the University. Only by 1890 money could be found for this purpose and in this year Mendeleev resigned his chair, leaving Menshutkin in the position of senior professor of the university. Menshutkin managed to build the laboratories by October 1894 and worked there for eight years.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1902 Menshutkin was transferred to the new Polytechnic Institute, about 6&nbsp;km north of St. Petersburg, while retaining the professorship in the university. There he acted as professor of analytical and organic chemistry and dean of the mining division. From the establishment of the Russian Chemical Society in 1868, and until 1891, Menshutkin served as its secretary and became its president in 1906. As deputy of a province he was able to improve popular education and help establishing several new schools. At the end of 1905 he took an active part in the elections for the first [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|Duma]], and was one of the founders of the [[Party of Democratic Reform (Russia)|Party of Democratic Reform]]. Menshutkin had suffered for many years from disorder of the kidneys. He survived an attack at the end of 1906, but then suddenly died in February 1907.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Research==\nFor his PhD thesis, Menshutkin studied the reactions of [[phosphonic acid]] and was able to prove that not all three [[hydrogen]] atoms in the molecule are equivalent and therefore the formula HP(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub> is more likely than P(OH)<sub>3</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18651330307|title = Ueber die Einwirkung des Chloracetyls auf phosphorige S\u00e4ure|year = 1865|last1 = Menschutkin|first1 = N.|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 133|pages = 317\u2013320|issue = 3|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1427243}}</ref> In 1890 Menshutkin discovered that a [[tertiary amine]] can be converted into a [[quaternary ammonium salt]] by reaction with an [[alkyl halide]].<ref name=\"Mens1890\">{{cite journal|first = N.|last = Menschutkin|title = Beitr\u00e4gen zur Kenntnis der Affinit\u00e4tskoeffizienten der Alkylhaloide und der organischen Amine|journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume = 5|year = 1890|pages = 589|doi=10.1515/zpch-1890-0546}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first = N.|last = Menschutkin|title = \u00dcber die Affinit\u00e4tskoeffizienten der Alkylhaloide und der Amine|journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume = 6|year = 1890|pages = 41|doi=10.1515/zpch-1890-0607}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mensutkin.png|center|400px|Menshutkin-reaction]]\n\nMenshutkin further studied the influence of isomerism among [[alcohol]]s and acids on [[esterification]] and showed that, both in respect of rate and limit, the [[Primary alcohol|primary]], secondary, and tertiary alcohols differ from one another, and that [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] differ from saturated alcohols.

Subsequently, the rate of chemical change was studied in the case of the formation of [[amide]]s and [[anilide]]s by the action of [[ammonia]] and [[aniline]] on acids by means of the same method as was employed in the esterification experiments. Here again the influence of [[isomer]]ic differences was equally manifest. These researches led on to others, such as the study of the mutual displacement of [[base (chemistry)|bases]] in [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] systems, and the influence of temperature on the rate of several reactions.\n\nMenshutkin further studied the effect of different solvents on the [[reaction rate]]s. Although the [[solvent]] is unaltered after the reaction, its influence on the reaction rate was significant.<ref name=\"Mens1890\"/> The stabilization of the reactants, products and intermediate phases or transition states depended strongly on the polarity of the solvent, and therefore this polarity had a large influence on the reaction rate. Because of the formation of ionic products, the effect was especially strong in the [[Menshutkin reaction]] making it an ideal tool to study the effect of solvent on the reaction rate. The Menshutkin reaction is still used for this purpose.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ja00859a008|title = Quantitative study of solvent effects on Menshutkin reaction between 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and (2-chloroethyl)benzene, (2-bromoethyl)benzene, and (2-iodoethyl)benzene|first1 = M.|last1 = Auriel|first2 = E.|last2 = De Hoffmann|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|year = 1975|volume = 97|issue = 26|pages = 7433\u20137437}}</ref> <!--10.1021/ja00538a031 10.1021/ja00859a008 10.1021/ja983736t 10.1021/ar950140r -->\n\nBetween 1889 and 1895 Menshutkin focused on amines, on the kinetics of their interaction\nwith [[alkyl]] [[halogen]] compounds and its dependence on the isomerism.

He graduated with honors from gymnasium in December 1857, but only by autumn 1858 managed to enroll to the [[Saint Petersburg State University]], as he was still under the prescribed age of 16. He studied at the faculty of physics and mathematics and was nearly expelled in the autumn of 1861 due to some political disturbances. Nevertheless, by the spring of 1862 he attained the master's degree. During the last years he became interested in chemistry, which he studied under [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. While he acquired a sufficient knowledge of theory he was lacking practice, as at that time the entire laboratory of the university consisted of only two small rooms. Therefore, he went abroad, and in the following three years spent two semesters with [[Adolph Strecker]] at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], a year (1864\u20135) with [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]] at the [[University of Paris]], and a semester with [[Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe]] at the [[University of Marburg]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn the meantime, many changes were introduced into the constitution of the Russian universities. In 1863 the universities obtained academic freedom, they chose for themselves the professors,\ndeans, and rectors, at the same time the means of teaching improved, and, owing to Mendeleev\u2019s efforts, the laboratory at St. Petersburg University was enlarged. In 1865 Menshutkin returned to St. Petersburg, just after his PhD thesis was published in the ''Comptes Rendus'' of the French Academy under the title \u201cAction du chlorure d\u2019acetyle sur l\u2019acide phosphoreux\u201d. He defended it in March 1866 against [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] and Dmitri Mendeleev and in autumn began teaching a course on organic nitrogen compounds. On 6 April 1869, he defended his [[habilitation]] on \u201cThe Synthesis and Properties of the Ureides\u201d and shortly was appointed as professor of analytical chemistry. In connection with his teaching he proceeded to rearrange the course of instructions and in 1871 brought out his well-known textbook, which survived 16 editions up to 1931 and had been translated into German and English. In 1871, Menshutkin became secretary of the faculty of physics and mathematics and in 1879 was appointed as dean, an office which he held until 1887.<ref name=r1/>\n\nThe assassination of the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881 was followed by the adoption of severe measures, from the effects of which the universities suffered in many ways. The autonomy granted in 1863 was revoked and all officials could only be appointed by the Minister of Public Instruction; the admission of students was hindered by accepting them only from certain schools, the fees were raised and the number of professorships reduced. The discontent by professors and students resulted in disturbances in 1887-8, which were followed by the resignation of the rector and several key officials. As a result, Menshutkin had to add teaching of organic chemistry to his duties. About this time he prepared his large handbook of organic chemistry, which appeared in three successive editions, and in 1888 he published a history of the development of chemical theory. Both books were written in Russian and not translated. One of Menshutkin\u2019s most serious undertakings of the time was the building of the new chemical laboratories of the University. Only by 1890 money could be found for this purpose and in this year Mendeleev resigned his chair, leaving Menshutkin in the position of senior professor of the university. Menshutkin managed to build the laboratories by October 1894 and worked there for eight years.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1902 Menshutkin was transferred to the new Polytechnic Institute, about 6&nbsp;km north of St. Petersburg, while retaining the professorship in the university. There he acted as professor of analytical and organic chemistry and dean of the mining division. From the establishment of the Russian Chemical Society in 1868, and until 1891, Menshutkin served as its secretary and became its president in 1906. As deputy of a province he was able to improve popular education and help establishing several new schools. At the end of 1905 he took an active part in the elections for the first [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|Duma]], and was one of the founders of the [[Party of Democratic Reform (Russia)|Party of Democratic Reform]]. Menshutkin had suffered for many years from disorder of the kidneys. He survived an attack at the end of 1906, but then suddenly died in February 1907.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Research==\nFor his PhD thesis, Menshutkin studied the reactions of [[phosphonic acid]] and was able to prove that not all three [[hydrogen]] atoms in the molecule are equivalent and therefore the formula HP(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub> is more likely than P(OH)<sub>3</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18651330307|title = Ueber die Einwirkung des Chloracetyls auf phosphorige S\u00e4ure|year = 1865|last1 = Menschutkin|first1 = N.|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 133|pages = 317\u2013320|issue = 3|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1427243}}</ref> In 1890 Menshutkin discovered that a [[tertiary amine]] can be converted into a [[quaternary ammonium salt]] by reaction with an [[alkyl halide]].<ref name=\"Mens1890\">{{cite journal|first = N.|last = Menschutkin|title = Beitr\u00e4gen zur Kenntnis der Affinit\u00e4tskoeffizienten der Alkylhaloide und der organischen Amine|journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume = 5|year = 1890|pages = 589|doi=10.1515/zpch-1890-0546}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first = N.|last = Menschutkin|title = \u00dcber die Affinit\u00e4tskoeffizienten der Alkylhaloide und der Amine|journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume = 6|year = 1890|pages = 41|doi=10.1515/zpch-1890-0607}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mensutkin.png|center|400px|Menshutkin-reaction]]\n\nMenshutkin further studied the influence of isomerism among [[alcohol]]s and acids on [[esterification]] and showed that, both in respect of rate and limit, the [[Primary alcohol|primary]], secondary, and tertiary alcohols differ from one another, and that [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] differ from saturated alcohols.
