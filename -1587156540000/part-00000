After years of diplomatic negotiation, Britain and France agreed to abrogate the convention in 1887 and the French formally annexed all the Leeward Islands without official treaties of cession from the islands' sovereign governments.

Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''d\u00e9partements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters. Foccart supported in particular the [[Nigerian Civil War]] during the late 1960s.<ref>Dorothy Shipley White, ''Black Africa and de Gaulle: From the French Empire to Independence'' (1979).</ref>\n\nRobert Aldrich argues that with Algerian independence in 1962, it appeared that the Empire practically had come to an end, as the remaining colonies were quite small and lacked active nationalist movements. However, there was trouble in French Somaliland ([[Djibouti]]), which became independent in 1977. There also were complications and delays in the New Hebrides [[Vanuatu]], which was the last to gain independence in 1980.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of [[New France]].

A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire,\" that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|11500000|km2|sqmi|-5|abbr=on}} in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939.\n\nThe main competition included [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], the Dutch [[Dutch Empire|United Provinces]] and [[English overseas possessions|England]] and later [[British Empire|Great Britain]]. France began to establish colonies in [[New France|North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[French India|India]] in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The North American holdings were ceded to Britain and Spain but the later retroceded [[Louisiana (New France)]] back to France in 1800 . The territory was then sold to the United States in 1803 ([[Louisiana Purchase]]). France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, concentrating chiefly [[French African colonies|in Africa]] as well as [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany after 1880 started to build [[German colonial empire|its own colonial empire]]. As it developed, the new French empire took on roles of trade with the motherland, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire rebuilt French prestige, especially regarding international power and spreading the [[French language]] and the Catholic religion. It also provided manpower in the World Wars.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tony Chafer |title=The End of Empire in French West Africa: France's Successful Decolonization? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GseKljgaW0C&pg=PA84 |year=2002 |publisher=Berg |pages=84\u201385 |isbn=9781859735572 }}</ref>\n\nA major goal was the {{lang|fr|Mission civilisatrice}} or \"The Civilizing Mission\".

Major revolts in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] and  [[Algerian War|Algeria]] proved very expensive and France lost both colonies.  Then followed a relatively peaceful [[decolonization of Africa|decolonization]] elsewhere after 1960.  The [[French constitution]] of 27 October 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the [[French Union]] which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as [[overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394&nbsp;km\u00b2 (46,098 sq. miles),  with 2.7 million people in 2013.

A few years later, in 1608, [[Samuel De Champlain]] founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]], which was to become the capital of the enormous, but sparsely settled, fur-trading colony of [[New France]] (also called Canada).<ref>Marcel Trudel, ''The Beginnings of New France, 1524\u20131663'' (McClelland & Stewart, 1973).</ref>\n\nNew France had a rather small population, which resulted from more emphasis being placed on the fur trade rather than agricultural settlements. Due to this emphasis, the French relied heavily on creating friendly contacts with the local First Nations community. Without the appetite of New England for land, and by relying solely on Aboriginals to supply them with fur at the trading posts, the French composed a complex series of military, commercial, and diplomatic connections. These became the most enduring alliances between the French and the First Nation community. The French were, however, under pressure from religious orders to convert them to Catholicism.<ref>James R. Miller, ''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: A history of Indian-white relations in Canada'' (University of Toronto Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThrough alliances with various Native American tribes, the French were able to exert a loose control over much of the North American continent. Areas of French settlement were generally limited to the [[St. Lawrence River]] Valley. Prior to the establishment of the 1663 [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]], the territories of New France were developed as [[mercantilism|mercantile colonies]]. It is only after the arrival of intendant [[Jean Talon]] in 1665 that France gave its American colonies the proper means to develop population colonies comparable to that of the British. Acadia itself was lost to the British in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713. Back in France there was relatively little interest in colonialism, which concentrated rather on dominance within Europe, and for most of its history, New France was far behind the [[British North America]]n colonies in both population and economic development.<ref>Edward Robert Adair,  \"France and the Beginnings of New France.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 25.3 (1944): 246\u2013278.</ref><ref>Helen Dewar, \"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760\u20131763.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 91.4 (2010): 637\u2013660.</ref>\n\nIn 1699, French territorial claims in North America expanded still further, with the foundation of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]].

Settlement along the South American coast in what is today [[French Guiana]] began in 1624, and a colony was founded on [[Saint Kitts]] in 1625 (the island had to be shared with the English until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, when it was ceded outright). The ''[[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]]'' founded colonies in [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] in 1635, and a colony was later founded on [[Saint Lucia]] by (1650).

These wars were the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u20131783), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1793\u20131802) and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). It may even be seen further back in time to the first of the [[French and Indian Wars]]. This cyclic conflict is sometimes known as the [[Second Hundred Years' War]].\n\nAlthough the War of the Austrian Succession was indecisive \u2013 despite French successes in India under the French Governor-General [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]] and Europe under [[Marshal Saxe]] \u2013 the Seven Years' War, after early French successes in [[Menorca]] and North America, saw a French defeat, with the numerically superior British (over one million to about 50 thousand French settlers) conquering not only [[New France]] (excluding the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]), but also most of France's West Indian (Caribbean) colonies, and all of the [[French India|French Indian outposts]].\n\nWhile the peace treaty saw France's Indian outposts, and the Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe restored to France, the competition for influence in India had been won by the British, and North America was entirely lost \u2013 most of [[New France]] was taken by Britain (also referred to as [[British North America]]), except [[Louisiana]], which France ceded to Spain as payment for Spain's late entrance into the war (and as compensation for Britain's annexation of Spanish Florida). Also ceded to the British were [[Grenada]] and [[Saint Lucia]] in the West Indies. Although the loss of Canada would cause much regret in future generations, it excited little unhappiness at the time; colonialism was widely regarded as both unimportant to France, and immoral.<ref>Colin Gordon Calloway,  ''The scratch of a pen: 1763 and the transformation of North America'' (2006). pp 165\u201369</ref>\n\nSome recovery of the French colonial empire was made during the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolution]], with Saint Lucia being returned to France by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, but not nearly as much as had been hoped for at the time of French intervention. True disaster came to what remained of France's colonial empire in 1791 when Saint Domingue (the Western third of the Caribbean island of [[Hispaniola]]), France's richest and most important colony, was riven by a massive slave revolt, caused partly by the divisions among the island's elite, which had resulted from the [[French Revolution]] of 1789.\n\nThe slaves, led eventually by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and then, following his capture by the French in 1801, by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], held their own against French and British opponents, and ultimately achieved independence as [[First Empire of Haiti|Empire of Haiti]] in 1804 (Haiti became the first black republic in the world, followed by Liberia in 1847).<ref>Mimi Sheller,  \"The 'Haytian Fear': Racial Projects and Competing Reactions to the First Black Republic.\" ''Research in Politics and Society'' 6 (1999): 285\u2013304.</ref> The black and mulatto population of the island (including the Spanish east) had declined from 700,000 in 1789 to 351,819 in 1804.

These were restored at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, but when war resumed in 1803, the British soon recaptured them. France's repurchase of Louisiana in 1800 came to nothing, as the success of the [[Haitian Revolution]] convinced Napoleon that holding Louisiana would not be worth the cost, leading to [[Louisiana Purchase|its sale]] to the United States in 1803. The French attempt to establish a colony in Egypt in 1798\u20131801 was not successful.

The British remained officially neutral during the war but diplomatic tensions existed between the French and British. The French succeeded in subduing the guerilla forces on Tahiti but failed to hold the other islands. In February 1847, Queen P\u014dmare IV returned from her self-imposed exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency [[Moorea]] continued to be ruled under the protectorate. A clause to the war settlement, known as the [[Jarnac Convention]] or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847, was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen P\u014dmare's allies in Leeward Islands.

He joined Britain in sending an army to China during [[Second Opium War]] and the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1860), but French ventures to establish influence in [[Japan]] (1867) and [[Korea]] (1866) were less successful. His attempt to impose a European monarch, [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on the Mexicans ended in a spectacular failure in 1867. To restore the Mexican Republic, 31,962 Mexicans died violently, including over 11,000 executed by firing squads, 8,304 were seriously wounded and 33,281 endured captivity in prisoner of war camps. Those Mexicans who fought for the monarchy sacrificed 5,671 of their number killed in combat, 2,159 badly wounded, and 4,379 taken prisoner.

A key part of the enterprise was the modernization of the French Navy; he began the construction of fifteen powerful new battle cruisers powered by steam and driven by propellers; and a fleet of steam powered troop transports. The French Navy became the second most powerful in the world, after Britain's. He also created a new force of colonial troops, including elite units of naval infantry, [[Zouaves]], the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and Algerian sharpshooters, and he expanded the Foreign Legion, which had been founded in 1831 and won fame in the Crimea, Italy and Mexico.

The economy had largely been based on the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]], carried out by the rulers of the small kingdoms of the interior, until France [[abolition of slavery|abolished slavery]] in its colonies in 1848. In 1854, Napoleon III named an enterprising [[French Army|French]] officer, [[Louis Faidherbe]], to govern and expand the colony, and to give it the beginning of a modern economy. Faidherbe built a series of forts along the Senegal River, formed alliances with leaders in the interior, and sent expeditions against those who resisted French rule. He built a new port at [[Dakar]], established and protected telegraph lines and roads, followed these with a [[Dakar-Saint-Louis railway|rail line between Dakar and Saint-Louis]] and [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|another into the interior]]. He built schools, bridges, and systems to supply fresh water to the towns. He also introduced the large-scale cultivation of [[Bambara groundnuts]] and peanuts as a commercial crop. Reaching into the [[Niger River|Niger]] valley, Senegal became the primary French base in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] and a model colony. Dakar became one of the most important cities of the French Empire and of Africa.<ref>G.

The object of his policy was not to take territory, but to assure that the vast and lucrative Chinese market was open to French commerce, and not the exclusive trading partner of Britain. In January 1858 a combined British and French fleet bombarded and occupied [[Guangzhou|Canton]], and landed troops at the mouth of the [[Hai River]] in northern China. In June 1858 the Chinese government in Peking was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] with Britain, France, Russia and the United States. This treaty opened six additional Chinese ports to European merchant ships, allowed Christian missionary activity, and legalized the import of opium into China.\n\n[[File:Looting of the Yuan Ming Yuan by Anglo French forces in 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Anglo-French forces pillage China's [[Summer Palace]], October 1860]]\nThe Chinese government was reluctant to observe the treaty, so Napoleon III and the British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] decided to take more forceful action, in what became known in history as the second phase of the [[Second Opium War]]. A joint French-British expeditionary force of 8,000 men was created under a French general, [[Charles Cousin-Montauban]], who had commanded French forces in Algeria. At the beginning of 1860 the French-British fleet sailed from Europe, and in the spring of 1860 landed the army in China. The Anglo-French army force, led by Cousin-Montauban, captured Tientsin, and then marched on the capital. On 21 September 1860 it defeated the army of the Chinese emperor at the [[Battle of Palikao]] and seized the capital Beijing. At the orders of the British commander [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], the British and French forces burned and pillaged the [[Old Summer Palace]] of the Chinese Emperor. On 25 October 1860, the Chinese Emperor was obliged to accept a second treaty of Tientsin, opening an additional eleven new ports to European trade, making westerners immune to prosecution by Chinese courts, and establishing western diplomatic missions in Beijing. Some of the art objects taken from the looted Summer Palace were carried to France, where the Empress used them to decorate a Chinese-themed salon at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where they can be seen today.<ref>H.

Twelve Catholic priests at the time were living in Korea, with an estimated 23,000 Korean converts, belonging to churches founded by French missionaries in the 18th century. In January 1866, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] and his father, regent [[Heungseon Daewongun|Daewongun]], ordered the execution of most of the French priests, and ten thousand converts. A squadron of French ships, carrying eight hundred naval infantry, attempted retaliation but made little headway.<ref>Daniel C. Kane, \"Bellonet and Roze: Overzealous Servants of Empire and the 1866 French Attack on Korea,\" ''Korean Studies'' (1999) Vol. 23, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn Japan the Meiji Emperor, and his enemies, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], both sought French military training and technology in their battle for power, known as the [[Boshin War]].\nIn 1867, a [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|military mission to Japan]] played a key role in modernizing the troops of the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], and even participated on his side against Imperial troops during the [[Boshin war]]. The European representative of the Shogunate, [[Shibata Takenaka]], approached both Britain and France, asking assistance to build a modern shipyard and to train the Shogunate army in modern western warfare. The shipyard, which became the naval base of [[Yokosuka]], was designed by the French engineer [[Leonce Verny]]. The British, who supported the imperial faction, declined to provide trainers, but Napoleon III agreed, and in 1867 dispatched a delegation of nineteen French military experts in the fields of infantry, cavalry and artillery to Japan. They trained an elite corps, called the [[Denshutai]], to fight on the side of the ''sh\u014dgun''.\n\nOn the other side, the Emperor purchased from the United States a French-built ironclad warship, renamed the [[Japanese ironclad K\u014dtetsu|Kotetsu]] (literally \"ironclad\"). It played an important role in the first modern naval battle fought in Japan. By 1868, the Imperial forces had won a decisive victory. French influence in the Japanese navy remained strong.<ref>Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba, ''The last shogun: the life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu'' (1998) pp. 169\u2013172</ref>\n\n===France in Indochina and the Pacific (1858\u20131870)===\nNapoleon III also acted to increase the French presence in Indochina. An important factor in his decision was the belief that France risked becoming a second-rate power by not expanding its influence in East Asia. Deeper down was the sense that France owed the world a civilizing mission.<ref>Arthur J. Dommen, ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'' (2001) p. 4</ref>\n\nFrench missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, when the Jesuit priest [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] opened a mission there. In 1858 the Vietnamese emperor of the [[Nguyen Dynasty]] felt threatened by the French influence and tried to expel the missionaries. Napoleon III sent a naval force of fourteen gunships, carrying three thousand French and three thousand Filipino troops provided by Spain, under [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], to compel the government to accept the missionaries and to stop the persecution of Catholics. In September 1858 the expeditionary force captured and occupied the port of [[Da Nang]], and then in February 1859 moved south and captured [[Saigon]]. The Vietnamese ruler was compelled to cede three provinces to France, and to offer protection to the Catholics. The French troops departed for a time to take part in the expedition to China, but in 1862, when the agreements were not fully followed by the Vietnamese emperor, they returned. The Emperor was forced to open treaty ports in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]], and all of [[Cochinchina]] became a French territory in 1864.\n\nIn 1863, the ruler of [[Cambodia]], King [[Norodom]], who had been placed in power by the government of [[Thailand]], rebelled against his sponsors and sought the protection of France. The Thai Emperor granted authority over Cambodia to France, in exchange for two provinces of [[Laos]], which were ceded by Cambodia to Thailand. In 1867, Cambodia formally became a protectorate of France.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859, painted by [[Antoine Morel-Fatio]]\nFile:Jean-Leon Gerome 001.JPG|Napoleon III receiving the [[France-Thailand relations|Siamese embassy]] at the palace of Fontainebleau in 1864\n</gallery>\n\n===Intervention in Syria and Lebanon (1860\u20131861)===\n[[File:French expeditionary corps landing in Beyrouth 16 August 1860.jpg|thumb|The [[R\u00e8glement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] led by General [[Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], landing in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860]]\nIn the spring of 1860, a war broke out in [[Lebanon]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], between the quasi-Muslim [[Druze]] population and the [[Maronite Christians]]. The Ottoman authorities in Lebanon could not stop the violence, and it spread into neighboring [[Syria]], with the massacre of many Christians. In [[Damascus]], the Emir Abd-el-Kadr protected the Christians there against the Muslim rioters. Napoleon III felt obliged to intervene on behalf of the Christians, despite the opposition of London, which feared it would lead to a wider French presence in the Middle East. After long and difficult negotiations to obtain the approval of the British government, Napoleon III sent a French contingent of seven thousand men for a period of six months. The troops arrived in Beirut in August 1860, and took positions in the mountains between the Christian and Muslim communities. Napoleon III organized an international conference in Paris, where the country was placed under the rule of a Christian governor named by the Ottoman Sultan, which restored a fragile peace. The French troops departed in June 1861, after just under one year. The French intervention alarmed the British, but was highly popular with the powerful Catholic political faction in France, which had been alarmed by Napoleon's dispute with the Pope over his territories in Italy.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 313</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n[[File:Vernet-Combat de Somah.jpg|thumb|The [[French North Africa|French conquest of Algeria]]]]\nAlgeria had been formally under French rule since 1830, but only in 1852 was the country entirely conquered. There were about 100,000 European settlers in the country, at that time, about half of them French. Under the Second Republic the country was ruled by a civilian government, but Louis Napoleon re-established a military government, much to the annoyance of the colonists. By 1857 the army had conquered Kabyle Province, and pacified the country.

In September 1860, however, he and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited Algeria, and the trip made a deep impression upon them. Eug\u00e9nie was invited to attend a traditional Arab wedding, and the Emperor met many of the local leaders. The Emperor gradually conceived the idea that Algeria should be governed differently from other colonies. in February 1863, he wrote a public letter to Pelissier, the Military Governor, saying: \"Algeria is not a colony in the traditional sense, but an Arab kingdom; the local people have, like the colonists, a legal right to my protection. I am just as much the Emperor of the Arabs of Algeria as I am of the French.\" He intended to rule Algeria through a government of Arab aristocrats. Toward this end he invited the chiefs of main Algerian tribal groups to his chateau at Compiegne for hunting and festivities.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 321-322</ref>\n\nCompared to previous administrations, Napoleon III was far more sympathetic to the native Algerians.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic period |last=Abun-Nasr |first=Jamil M. |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33767-0 |page=264 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=10 November 2010 }}</ref> He halted European migration inland, restricting them to the coastal zone. He also freed the Algerian rebel leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al Qadir]] (who had been promised freedom on surrender but was imprisoned by the previous administration) and gave him a stipend of 150,000 francs. He allowed Muslims to serve in the military and civil service on theoretically equal terms and allowed them to migrate to France. In addition, he gave the option of citizenship; however, for Muslims to take this option they had to accept all of the French civil code, including parts governing inheritance and marriage which conflicted with Muslim laws, and they had to reject the competence of religious [[Sharia]] courts. This was interpreted by some Muslims as requiring them to give up parts of their religion to obtain citizenship and was resented.\n\nMore importantly, Napoleon III changed the system of land tenure. While ostensibly well-intentioned, in effect this move destroyed the traditional system of land management and deprived many Algerians of land. While Napoleon did renounce state claims to tribal lands, he also began a process of dismantling tribal land ownership in favour of individual land ownership. This process was corrupted by French officials sympathetic to the French in Algeria who took much of the land they surveyed into public domain. In addition, many tribal leaders, chosen for loyalty to the French rather than influence in their tribe, immediately sold communal land for cash.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jamil M. Abun-Nasr|title=A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA264|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=264|isbn=9780521337670}}</ref>\n\nHis attempted reforms were interrupted in 1864 by an Arab insurrection, which required more than a year and an army of 85,000 soldiers to suppress. Nonetheless, he did not give up his idea of making Algeria a model where French colonists and Arabs could live and work together as equals. He traveled to Algiers for a second time on 3 May 1865, and this time he remained for a month, meeting with tribal leaders and local officials. He offered a wide amnesty to participants of the insurrection, and promised to name Arabs to high positions in his government. He also promised a large public works program of new ports, railroads, and roads. However, once again his plans met a major natural obstacle' in 1866 and 1867, Algeria was struck by an epidemic of cholera, clouds of locusts, draught and famine, and his reforms were hindered by the French colonists, who voted massively against him in the plebiscites of his late reign.<ref>Girard, 1986, p. 322-23</ref>\n\n===French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867)===\n{{Main|French intervention in Mexico|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|thumb|Napoleon III tried unsuccessfully to place [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, on the throne of Mexico. Portrait by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]] in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico]]\nIn December 1862, the conservative Mexican government was overthrown by [[Benito Juarez]], who established a secular state and refused to pay the internal and external debts of the old government. France was the largest owner of the debt, owed 135 million gold francs of the 260 million francs total. The rest of the debt was owed to Britain (85 million francs) and Spain (40 million). Under an 1861 agreement, France, Britain and Spain organized a joint military force to compel the Mexican government to pay. A British-French flotilla of ships arrived at [[Veracruz, Veracruz|VeraCruz]] in December 1861 and landed 7500 French soldiers and 700 British soldiers, joined later by 6000 Spanish soldiers from [[Cuba]].\n\nJuarez opened negotiations with the international force, but it soon became evident that the French expedition had a more ambitious objective than debt repayment. Napoleon III and the Empress had been intensively lobbied by Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Europe, who proposed that France establish a new conservative and Catholic government in Mexico, under a European monarch. Napoleon III was told that the new monarch would be welcomed by the entire Mexican population. He consented to launch the operation if the new monarch would be approved by a national plebiscite, as he had been. The monarch selected for this task was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|the Archduke Maximilian]], the brother of the Austrian Emperor Franz-Joseph II, and husband of [[Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of the King of Belgium.\n\nWhen the British and Spanish realized the French goals, they withdrew from the expedition, but the French marched on Mexico City. The first attempt by General Lorencez was repulsed by the forces of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] at [[Puebla]] on 5 May 1862, the first defeat of a French Army since Waterloo. Napoleon III appointed a new commander, General Forey, one of the victors of Solferino, and sent 23,000 fresh soldiers. Napoleon III believed that the Mexican people would embrace the new government. He also knew that the government of the United States would be unable to prevent it, even though it was in contravention of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], because of the [[American Civil War]] then underway, and the implicit support provided by the neighboring Confederate States of America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles M.

After bitter resistance, the defenders of Mexico City surrendered on 7 June 1863. Forey, disregarding Napoleon III's instructions not to install a monarch without a popular plebiscite, organized an assembly of Mexican notables who proclaimed the Mexican Empire and invited [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] to rule. Ruling President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and his Republican forces retreated to the countryside and fought against the French troops and the Mexican monarchists.\n\n[[File:San Pablo del Monte.jpg|thumb|French [[chasseurs d'Afrique]] taking the standard of the Durango lancers at the [[Battle of San Pablo del Monte]]]]\nMaximilian was a reluctant Emperor, not arriving in Mexico until June 1864. One of his first acts was to sign an agreement that Mexico would repay France the entire cost of the war. The combined Mexican monarchist and French forces won victories up until 1865, but then the tide began to turn against them, in part because the American Civil War had ended. The U.S. government demanded that France withdraw its soldiers from Mexico. Facing a guerilla war and a financial catastrophe, the Emperor Maximilian became more and more depressed, leaving the capital for long periods and allowing the [[Carlota of Mexico|Empress Carlota]] to reign. Not willing to have a war with the United States, Napoleon III decided at the beginning of 1866 to withdraw French troops from Mexico. In 1863 Maximilian had sent Carlota to Europe to appeal for funds and support. She appealed to Napoleon III, but he refused to provide more troops or money. During her tour of European courts, she lost and never regained her sanity. Maximilian refused pleas that he depart, and fought against the growing partisan army of Juarez. He was captured, judged, and shot on 19 June 1867.\n\nThe misadventure in Mexico cost the lives of six thousand French soldiers and 336 million francs, in a campaign originally designed to collect 60 million francs. It also aroused the hostility of both the United States and Austria, which had lost a member of its royal family. It was also a distraction to Napoleon III, on the eve of his coming confrontation with Prussia.<ref>Jasper Ridley, ''Maximilian and Ju\u00e1rez'' (1992).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Si\u00e8ge de Puebla - 29 mars 1863.PNG|The [[Siege of Puebla (1863)|Siege of Puebla]] by the French Army\nFile:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|The execution of Maximilian I on 19 June 1867, as painted by [[\u00c9douard Manet]].

[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], the British foreign minister from 1846 to 1851 and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1855 to 1865, sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe; this rarely involved an alignment with France.

Washington repeatedly warned that this meant war but the emperor kept this option open, hoping to get Britain as an ally. The Union blockade of southern ports stopped the supply of cotton to textile mills in France, and caused unemployment. The Confederacy had put their faith in [[Cotton diplomacy|\"King Cotton\" diplomacy]], expecting that the cutoff of cotton supplies would cause Britain and France to declare war to reopen the trade. Through 1862, Napoleon III met unofficially with Confederate diplomats, raising their hopes that he would unilaterally recognize the Confederacy. France was reluctant to act without collaboration with the British, who after much wavering finally rejected intervention as not worth the heavy risk of losing American food exports. Napoleon realized that a war with the U.S. without allies \"would spell disaster\" for France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVvZb5oeVtwC&pg=PA183|year=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=183|isbn=0803225822}}</ref> In 1863 the Confederacy realized there was no longer any chance of intervention, and expelled the French and British consuls, who were advising their citizens not to enlist in the Confederate Army.

Only [[Guinea]] refused by referendum to take part in the new colonial organisation. However, the French Community dissolved itself in the midst of the Algerian War; almost all of the other African colonies were granted independence in 1960, following local referendums. Some few colonies chose instead to remain part of France, under the status of [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas ''d\u00e9partements'' (territories)]]. Critics of [[neocolonialism]] claimed that the ''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'' had replaced formal direct rule. They argued that while de Gaulle was granting independence on one hand, he was creating new ties with the help of [[Jacques Foccart]], his counsellor for African matters.

France generally had close to the slowest natural population growth in Europe, and emigration pressures were therefore quite small. A small but significant emigration, numbering only in the tens of thousands, of mainly [[Roman Catholic]] French populations led to the settlement of the provinces of [[Acadia]], Canada and [[Louisiana]], both (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the [[West Indies]], [[Mascarene]] islands and Africa. In New France, Huguenots were banned from settling in the territory, and Quebec was one of the most staunchly Catholic areas in the world until the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The current [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] population, which numbers in the millions, is descended almost entirely from New France's small settler population.\n\nOn 31 December 1687 a community of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenots]] settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the [[Cape Colony]], but have since been quickly absorbed into the [[Afrikaner]] population.

The enclave currently occupies the area in and around [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]]. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, [[Chinese bakery|bakeries]], supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in [[Limehouse]] in the [[East End of London|East End]].\n\n==History==\nThe first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the [[Limehouse]] area of the [[East End of London]].<ref>Sales, Rosemary; d'Angelo, Alessio; Liang, Xiujing; Montagna, Nicola. \"London's Chinatown\" in Donald, Stephanie; Kohman, Eleonore; Kevin, Catherine. (eds) (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wVJkryx7cJAC&pg=PA45 ''Branding Cities: Cosmopolitanism, Parochialism, and Social Change'']. [[Routledge]]. pp. 45\u201358.</ref> At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in [[London Docklands|Docklands]]. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of [[slum housing]] and (the then-legal) [[opium]] dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during [[the Blitz]] in the [[Second World War]], although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of [[Chinese cuisine]] and an influx of immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere.\n\nThe present Chinatown, which is off [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]] the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor & Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario's Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker's, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, [[Harrison Marks]]' Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street,<ref>In the 1950s, followed by SeeWoo, a Chinese supermarket, still serving the community today. Lisle Street was the Mecca of electronic junk, attracting hifi and television enthusiasts from all over southern England</ref> parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor & Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/restaurants/article2861.ece \"Giles Coren reviews Empress of Sichuan\"]. [[The Times]]. 20 February 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the property developer [[Rosewheel]] proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in [[protest]] of violent tactics by immigration officers from the [[Home Office]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/chinatown-protest-immigration-fishing-raids/|title=Chinatown in London is shutting down to protest \u2018violent fishing raids\u2019 by immigration officials|date=2018-07-24|work=i|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/22/chinatown-protest-immigration-border-agency-raids|title=Chinatown workers walk out in protest at immigration raids|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|date=2013-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>. \n\nThe London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation.

The enclave currently occupies the area in and around [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]]. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, [[Chinese bakery|bakeries]], supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in [[Limehouse]] in the [[East End of London|East End]].\n\n==History==\nThe first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the [[Limehouse]] area of the [[East End of London]].<ref>Sales, Rosemary; d'Angelo, Alessio; Liang, Xiujing; Montagna, Nicola. \"London's Chinatown\" in Donald, Stephanie; Kohman, Eleonore; Kevin, Catherine. (eds) (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wVJkryx7cJAC&pg=PA45 ''Branding Cities: Cosmopolitanism, Parochialism, and Social Change'']. [[Routledge]]. pp. 45\u201358.</ref> At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in [[London Docklands|Docklands]]. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of [[slum housing]] and (the then-legal) [[opium]] dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during [[the Blitz]] in the [[Second World War]], although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of [[Chinese cuisine]] and an influx of immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere.\n\nThe present Chinatown, which is off [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]] the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor & Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario's Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker's, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, [[Harrison Marks]]' Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street,<ref>In the 1950s, followed by SeeWoo, a Chinese supermarket, still serving the community today. Lisle Street was the Mecca of electronic junk, attracting hifi and television enthusiasts from all over southern England</ref> parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor & Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/restaurants/article2861.ece \"Giles Coren reviews Empress of Sichuan\"]. [[The Times]]. 20 February 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the property developer [[Rosewheel]] proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in [[protest]] of violent tactics by immigration officers from the [[Home Office]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/chinatown-protest-immigration-fishing-raids/|title=Chinatown in London is shutting down to protest \u2018violent fishing raids\u2019 by immigration officials|date=2018-07-24|work=i|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/22/chinatown-protest-immigration-border-agency-raids|title=Chinatown workers walk out in protest at immigration raids|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|date=2013-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>. \n\nThe London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation. Located since 1998 on the second floor of 28-29 Gerrard Street, the Centre relocated to 2 Leicester Court in 2012, above the [[Hippodrome, London#The Hippodrome Casino|Hippodrome Casino]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.ccc.org.uk/about-us/our-history-%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2/|work=London Chinatown Community Centre|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 July 2016, a new Chinatown gate on [[Wardour Street]] was opened by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew, the Duke of York]].
