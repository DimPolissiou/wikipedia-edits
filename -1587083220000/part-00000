Benga had been purchased from [[African slave trade]]rs by the missionary and anthropologist [[Samuel Phillips Verner]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=John R.|title=Pioneer African Missionary: Samuel Phillips Verner|journal=Journal of Presbyterian History (1962-1985)|date=1982|volume=60|issue=1|pages=42\u201357|jstor=23328464}}</ref> a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition.<ref>{{cite news|title=Caged in the human zoo: The shocking story of the young pygmy warrior put on show in a monkey house \u2013 and how he fuelled Hitler's twisted beliefs|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1224189/Caged-human-zoo-The-shocking-story-young-pygmy-warrior-monkey-house--fuelled-Hitlers-twisted-beliefs.html|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=Dailymail|date=October 31, 2009}}</ref> \nHe accompanied Verner to the United States. Later, at the Bronx Zoo, Benga was allowed to walk the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in [[Virginia]], for the rest of his life.\n\n[[African-American newspapers]] around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga's treatment. [[Robert Stuart MacArthur]], spokesman for a delegation of black churches, petitioned New York City Mayor [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] for his release from the Bronx Zoo.{{year needed|date=May 2018}} In late 1906, the mayor released Benga to the custody of James M. Gordon, who supervised the [[Howard Colored Orphan Asylum]] in Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth [[Dental restoration|capped]]. This would enable Benga to be more readily accepted in local society. Benga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory.\n\nHe began to plan a return to Africa, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 stopped all ship passenger travel. Benga fell into a [[clinical depression|depression]]. He died by [[suicide]] in 1916.<ref>{{cite book|last=Evanzz|first=Karl|title=The Messenger: The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad|year=1999|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679442608}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nAs a member of the [[Mbuti]] people,<ref>Bradford and Blume describe Benga as Mbuti and write, \"A feature article described Ota Benga as 'a dwarfy, black specimen of sad-eyed humanity.' He was sad because the others were Batwa but he was not ...\" (p. 116). They later mention that he \"never fully assimilated into the Batwa\" during his time with them. Parezo and Fowler refer to \"[t]he Mbuti (Batwa) Pygmies and 'Red Africans'\" and note that \"McGee called them all Batwa, 'real aboriginals of the Dark Continent'&nbsp;... [Benga] was slightly taller than the other Pygmies, a characteristic common to his society, the Badinga or Chiri-chiri. Verner considered the Chiri-chiris a Pygmy society, and McGee and the press decided not to quibble over details.\" (pp. 200\u2013203). Many sources, e.g. Adams (p. 25) and [[NPR]], simply describe him as \"a Batwa Pygmy from Africa\".</ref> Ota Benga lived in equatorial forests near the [[Kasai River]] in what was then the [[Congo Free State]]. His people were attacked by the ''[[Force Publique]],'' established by [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]] as a militia to control the natives for labor in order to exploit the large supply of [[rubber]] in the Congo.\n\nBenga's wife and two children were murdered; he survived only because he was on a hunting expedition when the Force Publique attacked his village. He was later captured by \"Baschelel\" ([[Lele people|Bashilele]]) slave traders.<ref>name=\"nyt2006\"</ref><ref name=\"National Public Radio\">{{cite web|title=Looking Back at the Strange Case of Ota Benga|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6225825|website=NPR.org|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=September 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt2006\"/>\n\nIn 1904 American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner travelled to Africa under contract from the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (St. Louis World Fair) to bring back an assortment of pygmies to be part of an exhibition.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 97\u201398.</ref> To demonstrate the fledgling discipline of [[anthropology]], the noted scientist [[W.

There the villagers had developed distrust for the ''muzungu'' (white man) due to the abuses of King Leopold's forces. Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him for travel to the United States until Benga said that the ''muzungu'' had saved his life, and spoke of the bond that had grown between them, and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from. Four Batwa, all male, ultimately decided to accompany them. Verner also recruited other Africans who were not pygmies: five men from the [[Kuba Kingdom|Bakuba]], including the son of King Ndombe, ruler of the Bakuba; and other related peoples&nbsp;\u2013 \"Red Africans\", as they were collectively labeled by contemporary anthropologists.<ref name=\"parezo204\">Parezo and Fowler (2007), p. 204.</ref><ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n====St. Louis World Fair====\n[[File:Louisiana Purchase pygmies.jpg|thumb|Benga (second from left) and the Batwa in St. Louis]]\nThe group was brought to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in late June 1904 without Verner, who had been taken ill with [[malaria]]. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun, and the Africans immediately became the center of attention. Ota Benga was particularly popular, and his name was reported variously by the press as ''Artiba'', ''Autobank'',<ref name=\"Bradford Geronimo\">Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 12\u201316.</ref> ''Ota Bang'', and ''Otabenga''. He had an amiable personality, and visitors were eager to see his teeth, which had been [[human tooth sharpening|filed to sharp points]] in his early youth as ritual decoration. The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances. One newspaper account, promoting Ota Benga as \"the only genuine African [[cannibal]] in America\", claimed \"[his teeth were] worth the five cents he charges for showing them to visitors\".<ref name=\"parezo204\" />\n\nWhen Verner arrived a month later, he realized the pygmies were more prisoners than performers. Their attempts to congregate peacefully in the forest on Sundays were thwarted by the crowds' fascination with them. McGee's attempts to present a \"serious\" scientific exhibit were also overturned. On July 28, the Africans' performing to the crowd's preconceived notion that they were \"savages\", resulted in the First Illinois Regiment being called in to control the mob. Benga and the other Africans eventually performed in a warlike fashion, imitating [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] they saw at the Exhibition.<ref name=\"Verner arrive\">Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 118\u2013121</ref> The [[Apache]] chief [[Geronimo]] (featured as \"The Human Tyger\"&nbsp;\u2013 with special dispensation from the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]])<ref name=\"Bradford Geronimo\" /> grew to admire Benga, and gave him one of his [[arrowhead]]s. For his efforts, Verner was awarded the gold medal in anthropology at the close of the Exposition.<ref name=\"Verner arrive\" />\n\n====American Museum of Natural History====\nBenga accompanied Verner when he returned the other Africans to the Congo. He briefly lived amongst the Batwa while continuing to accompany Verner on his African adventures. He married a Batwa woman who later died of snakebite, and little is known of this second marriage. Not feeling that he belonged with the Batwa, Benga chose to return with Verner to the United States.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 151\u2013158.</ref>\n\nVerner eventually arranged for Benga to stay in a spare room at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City while he was tending to other business. Verner negotiated with the curator Henry Bumpus over the presentation of his acquisitions from Africa and potential employment. While Bumpus was put off by Verner's request of what he thought was the prohibitively high salary of $175 a month and was not impressed by the man's credentials, he was interested in Benga. Benga initially enjoyed his time at the museum, where he was given a Southern-style linen suit to wear when he entertained. He became homesick for his own culture.<ref name=\"museum\">Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 159\u2013168.</ref>\n\nThe writers Bradford and Blume imagined his feelings:\n\n<blockquote>What at first held his attention now made him want to flee. It was maddening to be inside&nbsp;\u2013 to be swallowed whole&nbsp;\u2013 so long. He had an image of himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 165\u2013166.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe disaffected Benga attempted to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation of him as a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the chair across the room, just missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.<ref name =\"museum\" />\n\n====Bronx Zoo====\nAt the suggestion of Bumpus, Verner took Benga to the [[Bronx Zoo]] in 1906. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the zoo, initially enlisted Benga to help maintain the animal habitats. However, Hornaday saw that people took more notice of Benga than the animals at the zoo, and he eventually created an exhibition to feature Benga.<ref name=\"National Public Radio\"/> At the zoo, the Mbuti man was allowed to roam the grounds, but there is no record that he was ever paid for his work.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/> He became fond of an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, \"the presiding genius of the Monkey House\", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 172\u2013174.</ref>\n\nThe events leading to his \"exhibition\" alongside Dohong were gradual:<ref name=\"nyt2006\">\n{{cite news\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html\n |title=The Scandal at the Zoo\n |date=August 6, 2006\n |work=The New York Times\n |last = Keller | first=Mitch\n}}</ref> Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, and the zoo encouraged him to hang his [[hammock]] there, and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/>\n\n[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|thumb|Ota Benga at the Bronx Zoo in 1906. Only five promotional photos exist of Benga's time here, none of them in the \"Monkey House\"; cameras were not allowed.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), photo insert.</ref>]]\nSoon, a sign on the exhibit read:\n\n<blockquote>The African Pygmy, \"Ota Benga.\"<br />\nAge, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches.<br />\nWeight, 103 pounds. Brought from the<br />\nKasai River, Congo Free State, South Cen-<br />\ntral Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner. Ex-<br />\nhibited each afternoon during September.<ref name=\"nyt1906\">\"Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy,\" ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1906, p. 1.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by [[Madison Grant]], Secretary of the [[New York Zoological Society]], who lobbied to put Ota Benga on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo. A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a [[scientific racism|racial anthropologist]] and [[eugenics|eugenicist]].<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 173\u2013175.</ref>\n\n[[African-American]] clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. Said James H. Gordon,\n\n<blockquote>Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/></blockquote>\n\nGordon thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and was effectively a promotion of [[Darwinism]]:\n\n<blockquote>The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/></blockquote>\n\nA number of clergymen backed Gordon.<ref name=\"Spiro 47\">Spiro (2008), p. 47.</ref> In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested:\n\n<blockquote>We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.<ref name=\"Spiro 48\">Spiro (2008), p. 48.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the controversy, Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent.<ref>Smith (1998). See chapter on Ota Benga.</ref>  Around this time, an article in ''The New York Times'' quoted [[Robert Stuart MacArthur]] as saying, \"It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him.\"<ref name=\"nyt1906\" />\n\nThe zoo finally removed Benga from the grounds. Verner was unsuccessful in his continued search for employment, but he occasionally spoke to Benga. The two had agreed that it was in Benga's best interests to remain in the United States despite the unwelcome spotlight at the zoo.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 187\u2013190.</ref>\n \nToward the end of 1906, Benga was released into Reverend Gordon's custody.<ref name=\"nyt2006\" />\n\n==Later life==\nGordon placed Benga in the [[Howard Colored Orphan Asylum]], a church-sponsored [[orphanage]] in [[Brooklyn]] that Gordon supervised. As the unwelcome press attention continued, in January 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga's relocation to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he lived with the McCray family.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 191\u2013204.</ref>\n\nSo that he could more easily be part of local society, Gordon arranged for Benga's teeth to be capped and bought him American-style clothes. He received tutoring from Lynchburg poet [[Anne Spencer]]<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> in order to improve his English, and  began to attend elementary school at the Baptist Seminary in Lynchburg.<ref name=\"Spiro 48\" />\n\nOnce he felt his English had improved sufficiently, Benga discontinued his formal education. He began working at a Lynchburg [[tobacco]] factory, and began to plan a return to Africa.<ref name=\"Spiro 49\">Spiro (2008), p. 49.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 1914, when [[World War I]] broke out, a return to the Congo became impossible as passenger ship traffic ended. Benga became depressed as his hopes for a return to his homeland faded.<ref name=\"Spiro 49\" /> On March 20, 1916, at the age of 32, he built a ceremonial fire, chipped off the caps on his teeth, and shot himself in the heart with a borrowed pistol.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Benga_Ota_ca_1883-1916 \"Ota Benga\"], ''Encyclopedia Virginia''</ref>\n\nHe was buried in an unmarked grave in the black section of the [[Old City Cemetery (Lynchburg, Virginia)|Old City Cemetery]], near his benefactor, Gregory Hayes. At some point, the remains of both men went missing. Local oral history indicates that Hayes and Ota Benga were eventually moved from the Old Cemetery to White Rock Hill Cemetery, a burial ground that later fell into disrepair.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 231.</ref> Benga received a historic marker in Lynchburg in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wset.com/news/local/man-caged-in-nyc-zoo-to-receive-historical-marker-in-lynchburg|title=Man caged in NYC zoo to receive historical marker in Lynchburg|last=Doss|first=Catherine|date=2017-09-12|website=WSET|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nPhillips Verner Bradford, the grandson of Samuel Phillips Verner, wrote a book on the Mbuti man, entitled ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo'' (1992). During his research for the book, Bradford visited the [[American Museum of Natural History]], which holds a life mask and body cast of Ota Benga.

Blume (1992), p. 54.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 March 20, 1916) was a [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]] ([[Congo Pygmies|Congo pygmy]]) man, known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1904, and in a [[human zoo]] exhibit in 1906 at the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Benga had been purchased from [[African slave trade]]rs by the missionary and anthropologist [[Samuel Phillips Verner]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=John R.|title=Pioneer African Missionary: Samuel Phillips Verner|journal=Journal of Presbyterian History (1962-1985)|date=1982|volume=60|issue=1|pages=42\u201357|jstor=23328464}}</ref> a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition.<ref>{{cite news|title=Caged in the human zoo: The shocking story of the young pygmy warrior put on show in a monkey house \u2013 and how he fuelled Hitler's twisted beliefs|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1224189/Caged-human-zoo-The-shocking-story-young-pygmy-warrior-monkey-house--fuelled-Hitlers-twisted-beliefs.html|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=Dailymail|date=October 31, 2009}}</ref> \nHe accompanied Verner to the United States. Later, at the Bronx Zoo, Benga was allowed to walk the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in [[Virginia]], for the rest of his life.\n\n[[African-American newspapers]] around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga's treatment. [[Robert Stuart MacArthur]], spokesman for a delegation of black churches, petitioned New York City Mayor [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] for his release from the Bronx Zoo.{{year needed|date=May 2018}} In late 1906, the mayor released Benga to the custody of James M. Gordon, who supervised the [[Howard Colored Orphan Asylum]] in Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth [[Dental restoration|capped]]. This would enable Benga to be more readily accepted in local society. Benga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory.\n\nHe began to plan a return to Africa, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 stopped all ship passenger travel. Benga fell into a [[clinical depression|depression]]. He died by [[suicide]] in 1916.<ref>{{cite book|last=Evanzz|first=Karl|title=The Messenger: The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad|year=1999|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679442608}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nAs a member of the [[Mbuti]] people,<ref>Bradford and Blume describe Benga as Mbuti and write, \"A feature article described Ota Benga as 'a dwarfy, black specimen of sad-eyed humanity.' He was sad because the others were Batwa but he was not ...\" (p. 116). They later mention that he \"never fully assimilated into the Batwa\" during his time with them. Parezo and Fowler refer to \"[t]he Mbuti (Batwa) Pygmies and 'Red Africans'\" and note that \"McGee called them all Batwa, 'real aboriginals of the Dark Continent'&nbsp;... [Benga] was slightly taller than the other Pygmies, a characteristic common to his society, the Badinga or Chiri-chiri. Verner considered the Chiri-chiris a Pygmy society, and McGee and the press decided not to quibble over details.\" (pp. 200\u2013203). Many sources, e.g. Adams (p. 25) and [[NPR]], simply describe him as \"a Batwa Pygmy from Africa\".</ref> Ota Benga lived in equatorial forests near the [[Kasai River]] in what was then the [[Congo Free State]]. His people were attacked by the ''[[Force Publique]],'' established by [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]] as a militia to control the natives for labor in order to exploit the large supply of [[rubber]] in the Congo.\n\nBenga's wife and two children were murdered; he survived only because he was on a hunting expedition when the Force Publique attacked his village. He was later captured by \"Baschelel\" ([[Lele people|Bashilele]]) slave traders.<ref>name=\"nyt2006\"</ref><ref name=\"National Public Radio\">{{cite web|title=Looking Back at the Strange Case of Ota Benga|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6225825|website=NPR.org|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=September 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"nyt2006\"/>\n\nIn 1904 American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner travelled to Africa under contract from the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (St. Louis World Fair) to bring back an assortment of pygmies to be part of an exhibition.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 97\u201398.</ref> To demonstrate the fledgling discipline of [[anthropology]], the noted scientist [[W. J. McGee]] intended to display \"representatives of all the world's peoples, ranging from smallest pygmies to the most gigantic peoples, from the darkest blacks to the dominant whites\" to show what was commonly thought then to be a sort of [[Scientific racism|cultural evolution]].<ref>Quoted in Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 5.</ref> Verner discovered Ota Benga while 'en route' to a [[Twa peoples|Batwa]] village visited previously; he purchased Benga from the slave traders for a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 102\u2013103.</ref><ref name=\"nyt2006\"/> Verner later claimed he had rescued Benga from cannibals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/336335-ota-benga-caged-pygmy/|title=100 years ago today, Ota Benga ended his horrible life after caged as 'pygmy' at Bronx Zoo|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=March 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe two spent several weeks together before reaching the Batwa village. There the villagers had developed distrust for the ''muzungu'' (white man) due to the abuses of King Leopold's forces. Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him for travel to the United States until Benga said that the ''muzungu'' had saved his life, and spoke of the bond that had grown between them, and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from. Four Batwa, all male, ultimately decided to accompany them. Verner also recruited other Africans who were not pygmies: five men from the [[Kuba Kingdom|Bakuba]], including the son of King Ndombe, ruler of the Bakuba; and other related peoples&nbsp;\u2013 \"Red Africans\", as they were collectively labeled by contemporary anthropologists.<ref name=\"parezo204\">Parezo and Fowler (2007), p. 204.</ref><ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\n\n====St. Louis World Fair====\n[[File:Louisiana Purchase pygmies.jpg|thumb|Benga (second from left) and the Batwa in St. Louis]]\nThe group was brought to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in late June 1904 without Verner, who had been taken ill with [[malaria]]. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun, and the Africans immediately became the center of attention. Ota Benga was particularly popular, and his name was reported variously by the press as ''Artiba'', ''Autobank'',<ref name=\"Bradford Geronimo\">Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 12\u201316.</ref> ''Ota Bang'', and ''Otabenga''. He had an amiable personality, and visitors were eager to see his teeth, which had been [[human tooth sharpening|filed to sharp points]] in his early youth as ritual decoration. The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances. One newspaper account, promoting Ota Benga as \"the only genuine African [[cannibal]] in America\", claimed \"[his teeth were] worth the five cents he charges for showing them to visitors\".<ref name=\"parezo204\" />\n\nWhen Verner arrived a month later, he realized the pygmies were more prisoners than performers. Their attempts to congregate peacefully in the forest on Sundays were thwarted by the crowds' fascination with them. McGee's attempts to present a \"serious\" scientific exhibit were also overturned. On July 28, the Africans' performing to the crowd's preconceived notion that they were \"savages\", resulted in the First Illinois Regiment being called in to control the mob. Benga and the other Africans eventually performed in a warlike fashion, imitating [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] they saw at the Exhibition.<ref name=\"Verner arrive\">Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 118\u2013121</ref> The [[Apache]] chief [[Geronimo]] (featured as \"The Human Tyger\"&nbsp;\u2013 with special dispensation from the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]])<ref name=\"Bradford Geronimo\" /> grew to admire Benga, and gave him one of his [[arrowhead]]s. For his efforts, Verner was awarded the gold medal in anthropology at the close of the Exposition.<ref name=\"Verner arrive\" />\n\n====American Museum of Natural History====\nBenga accompanied Verner when he returned the other Africans to the Congo. He briefly lived amongst the Batwa while continuing to accompany Verner on his African adventures. He married a Batwa woman who later died of snakebite, and little is known of this second marriage. Not feeling that he belonged with the Batwa, Benga chose to return with Verner to the United States.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 151\u2013158.</ref>\n\nVerner eventually arranged for Benga to stay in a spare room at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City while he was tending to other business. Verner negotiated with the curator Henry Bumpus over the presentation of his acquisitions from Africa and potential employment. While Bumpus was put off by Verner's request of what he thought was the prohibitively high salary of $175 a month and was not impressed by the man's credentials, he was interested in Benga. Benga initially enjoyed his time at the museum, where he was given a Southern-style linen suit to wear when he entertained. He became homesick for his own culture.<ref name=\"museum\">Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 159\u2013168.</ref>\n\nThe writers Bradford and Blume imagined his feelings:\n\n<blockquote>What at first held his attention now made him want to flee. It was maddening to be inside&nbsp;\u2013 to be swallowed whole&nbsp;\u2013 so long. He had an image of himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 165\u2013166.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe disaffected Benga attempted to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation of him as a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the chair across the room, just missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.<ref name =\"museum\" />\n\n====Bronx Zoo====\nAt the suggestion of Bumpus, Verner took Benga to the [[Bronx Zoo]] in 1906. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the zoo, initially enlisted Benga to help maintain the animal habitats. However, Hornaday saw that people took more notice of Benga than the animals at the zoo, and he eventually created an exhibition to feature Benga.<ref name=\"National Public Radio\"/> At the zoo, the Mbuti man was allowed to roam the grounds, but there is no record that he was ever paid for his work.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/> He became fond of an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, \"the presiding genius of the Monkey House\", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 172\u2013174.</ref>\n\nThe events leading to his \"exhibition\" alongside Dohong were gradual:<ref name=\"nyt2006\">\n{{cite news\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html\n |title=The Scandal at the Zoo\n |date=August 6, 2006\n |work=The New York Times\n |last = Keller | first=Mitch\n}}</ref> Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, and the zoo encouraged him to hang his [[hammock]] there, and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/>\n\n[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|thumb|Ota Benga at the Bronx Zoo in 1906. Only five promotional photos exist of Benga's time here, none of them in the \"Monkey House\"; cameras were not allowed.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), photo insert.</ref>]]\nSoon, a sign on the exhibit read:\n\n<blockquote>The African Pygmy, \"Ota Benga.\"<br />\nAge, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches.<br />\nWeight, 103 pounds. Brought from the<br />\nKasai River, Congo Free State, South Cen-<br />\ntral Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner. Ex-<br />\nhibited each afternoon during September.<ref name=\"nyt1906\">\"Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy,\" ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1906, p. 1.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by [[Madison Grant]], Secretary of the [[New York Zoological Society]], who lobbied to put Ota Benga on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo. A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a [[scientific racism|racial anthropologist]] and [[eugenics|eugenicist]].<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 173\u2013175.</ref>\n\n[[African-American]] clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. Said James H. Gordon,\n<blockquote>Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.\"<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/>  Gordon thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and was effectively a promotion of [[Darwinism]]: \"The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.<ref name=\"nyt2006\"/></blockquote>\n\nA number of clergymen backed Gordon.<ref name=\"Spiro 47\">Spiro (2008), p. 47.</ref> In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested:\n\n<blockquote>We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.<ref name=\"Spiro 48\">Spiro (2008), p. 48.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the controversy, Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent.<ref>Smith (1998). See chapter on Ota Benga.</ref>  Around this time, an article in ''The New York Times'' quoted [[Robert Stuart MacArthur]] as saying, \"It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him.\"<ref name=\"nyt1906\" />\n\nThe zoo finally removed Benga from the grounds. Verner was unsuccessful in his continued search for employment, but he occasionally spoke to Benga. The two had agreed that it was in Benga's best interests to remain in the United States despite the unwelcome spotlight at the zoo.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 187\u2013190.</ref>\n \nToward the end of 1906, Benga was released into Reverend Gordon's custody.<ref name=\"nyt2006\" />\n\n==Later life==\nGordon placed Benga in the [[Howard Colored Orphan Asylum]], a church-sponsored [[orphanage]] in [[Brooklyn]] that Gordon supervised. As the unwelcome press attention continued, in January 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga's relocation to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he lived with the McCray family.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 191\u2013204.</ref>\n\nSo that he could more easily be part of local society, Gordon arranged for Benga's teeth to be capped and bought him American-style clothes. He received tutoring from Lynchburg poet [[Anne Spencer]]<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> in order to improve his English, and  began to attend elementary school at the Baptist Seminary in Lynchburg.<ref name=\"Spiro 48\" />\n\nOnce he felt his English had improved sufficiently, Benga discontinued his formal education. He began working at a Lynchburg [[tobacco]] factory, and began to plan a return to Africa.<ref name=\"Spiro 49\">Spiro (2008), p. 49.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 1914, when [[World War I]] broke out, a return to the Congo became impossible as passenger ship traffic ended. Benga became depressed as his hopes for a return to his homeland faded.<ref name=\"Spiro 49\" /> On March 20, 1916, at the age of 32, he built a ceremonial fire, chipped off the caps on his teeth, and shot himself in the heart with a borrowed pistol.<ref>[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Benga_Ota_ca_1883-1916 \"Ota Benga\"], ''Encyclopedia Virginia''</ref>\n\nHe was buried in an unmarked grave in the black section of the [[Old City Cemetery (Lynchburg, Virginia)|Old City Cemetery]], near his benefactor, Gregory Hayes. At some point, the remains of both men went missing. Local oral history indicates that Hayes and Ota Benga were eventually moved from the Old Cemetery to White Rock Hill Cemetery, a burial ground that later fell into disrepair.<ref>Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 231.</ref> Benga received a historic marker in Lynchburg in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wset.com/news/local/man-caged-in-nyc-zoo-to-receive-historical-marker-in-lynchburg|title=Man caged in NYC zoo to receive historical marker in Lynchburg|last=Doss|first=Catherine|date=2017-09-12|website=WSET|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nPhillips Verner Bradford, the grandson of Samuel Phillips Verner, wrote a book on the Mbuti man, entitled ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo'' (1992). During his research for the book, Bradford visited the [[American Museum of Natural History]], which holds a life mask and body cast of Ota Benga.

This was the first Kansas City win at Denver since [[2000 Kansas City Chiefs season|2000]] and their first victory at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]] which opened in [[2001 NFL Season|2001]].

The Chiefs ended their season with a victory against the [[Denver Broncos]] who were looking to clinch a Wild-Card playoff berth with a win.  This was the first Kansas City win at Denver since [[2000 Kansas City Chiefs season|2000]] and their first victory at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]] which opened in [[2001 NFL Season|2001]]. This concluded the Chiefs season with a 4\u201312 record, a two-win improvement from 2008.\n\nIn Haley's second season, the Chiefs won their first three games, including the season opener on [[Monday Night Football]] against the [[San Diego Chargers]], and were the last undefeated team remaining in the NFL before losing at Indianapolis in Week 5.

Tight end [[Tony Moeaki]], a crucial piece of the team's 2011 offensive plans, injured his knee at the beginning of the second quarter and was ruled out for the remainder of the season. In a game played mostly by the Chiefs starters and the Packers' backups, the Chiefs lost, 20\u201319, leading many{{Who|date=November 2015}} to question Haley's decision to use his best players late into the game.\n\nDespite having lost several key players to injuries, on October 31, 2011, Haley led The Chiefs to a come-from-behind victory on ''Monday Night Football''.

Palko proved to be inadequate as a backup to a merely serviceable Cassel, leading many{{Who|date=November 2015}} to question how a team with legitimate playoff hopes entering the 2011 season had remained so thin at so many key positions during the off-season, especially at quarterback and safety, where the Chiefs' lack of depth was more than woeful.\n\nHaley was fired on December 12, 2011, after leading his team to a 5\u20138 record during the 2011 NFL season.<ref name=\"Firing\">{{cite web | title=Haley relieved of duties | url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/news/article-2/HALEY-RELIEVED-OF-DUTIES/9f2d029b-c450-48cb-9791-8038582a3270 | date=December 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011 | publisher=Kansas City Chiefs | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107051055/http://www.kcchiefs.com/news/article-2/HALEY-RELIEVED-OF-DUTIES/9f2d029b-c450-48cb-9791-8038582a3270 | archive-date=January 7, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The 2011 season began with three losses, including two blow-outs to Detroit and Buffalo.

Before Oasis, he was the drummer of [[Starclub]] from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums and one song on Dont Believe The Truth, two [[compilation album]]s and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer [[Tony McCarroll]] was removed from the band. He was recommended to [[Noel Gallagher]] by Gallagher's friend [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]. Notably, Alan's brother [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve]] has been longtime drummer for Weller. White left Oasis in early 2004 in somewhat unclear circumstances. He was replaced by [[Zak Starkey]], drummer of [[the Who]] and son of [[the Beatles]]' drummer [[Ringo Starr]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Before Oasis (1987\u20131995)===\nIn 1988, White auditioned to join future Oasis member [[Gem Archer]]'s band Whirlpool. \"He came down and just blew us all away,\" remembers Archer.<ref>[http://members.lycos.nl/tristanvdv/band_gem.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306162053/http://members.lycos.nl/tristanvdv/band_gem.php |date=6 March 2005 }}</ref> \"I thought he was mega but the others were worried what a 15-years-old kid on the road and on the lager would be like. I rang his dad and told him: 'Sorry. But don't worry he's fantastic. He'll go all the way.' And he did. It was the weirdest day when he welcomed me to Oasis. And he hasn't let me forget it.\" White also played drums on [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]'s wife [[Idha (singer)|Idha]]'s solo album, forming a connection with another future [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] member. It was at this session that Noel Gallagher first heard him playing, though he was recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller]]. Prior to joining Oasis, White drummed with London-based band [[Starclub]] and also for Dr Robert, lead singer of [[The Blow Monkeys]].\n\nWhite's brother, [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]], had played with Weller's [[The Style Council]] and various other famous musicians, including [[The Who]]. Because of this connection, Alan mentioned that Steve impacted greatly his development as a drummer. His other influences include [[Keith Moon]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Chad Smith]], [[Mick Avory]], and [[John Bonham]].\n\n===Oasis career (1995\u20132004)===\nWhite replaced original Oasis drummer [[Tony McCarroll]] in May 1995 and was immediately \"thrown in the deep end\", joining the band the very next day to perform a playback of \"[[Some Might Say]]\" in front of a national TV audience on [[BBC1]]'s long running music programme ''[[Top of The Pops]]''. One of White's first live shows with Oasis was in front of a massive crowd at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 1995.\n\nUntil the arrival of [[Andy Bell (bassist)|Andy Bell]] in the Autumn of 1999, White was the token southerner in the otherwise [[Manchester|Mancunian]] Oasis.  Initially known as 'Whitey', he was later re-christened 'Dave' by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from \"The Winchester\" in the '70s TV series ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]''. White commented on the \"North/South divide\" saying it was not that bad, but \"for ages I was the 'Cockney cunt' and they were the 'Manc fuckers'\". In his book ''What's the Story?'' Ian Robertson (who served as Oasis' tour manager from 1994 to 1995) stated that White was also known by the phrase \"Alan White \u2013 He's alright\".\nWhite was also entrusted with the job of being [[Liam Gallagher]]'s 'official' drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together the pair were known as '[[Bert and Ernie]]', named after the [[Sesame Street]]-characters. In December 2002 Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a German bar.

White performed on four of Oasis' studio albums: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' (1995), ''Be Here Now'' (1997), ''Standing on the Shoulder of Giants'' (2000) and ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' (2002) and Lyla on ''Dont Believe The Truth'' (2005) . He also played on the majority of band's [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s, some of which were released on the record ''[[The Masterplan (Oasis album)|The Masterplan]]'' (1998).\n\nWhite married model Liz Atkins on 13 August 1997 at Studley Priory Hotel, Oxfordshire. He had met her on the set of the \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" music video. The couple divorced in 2000.\n\n===Departure===\nIn early 2004, White surprisingly left Oasis during the early recording sessions for the band's sixth album. According to Oasis' spokesperson, there were some new tracks and demos with White's performances, which were made at the end of 2003 and early 2004 as the very first demos for their upcoming album, before his departure. In an interview, Noel Gallagher alluded to White's personal problems: \"He's a fucking great guy, and he's one of the best drummers I've ever met in my life, but his personal life is fucking chaos.

Before Oasis, he was the drummer of [[Starclub]] from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums and one song on Dont Believe The Truth, two [[compilation album]]s and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer [[Tony McCarroll]] was removed from the band. He was recommended to [[Noel Gallagher]] by Gallagher's friend [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]. Notably, Alan's brother [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve]] has been longtime drummer for Weller. White left Oasis in early 2004 in somewhat unclear circumstances. He was replaced by [[Zak Starkey]], drummer of [[The Who]] and son of [[The Beatles]]' drummer [[Ringo Starr]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Before Oasis (1987\u20131995)===\nIn 1988, White auditioned to join future Oasis member [[Gem Archer]]'s band Whirlpool. \"He came down and just blew us all away,\" remembers Archer.<ref>[http://members.lycos.nl/tristanvdv/band_gem.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306162053/http://members.lycos.nl/tristanvdv/band_gem.php |date=6 March 2005 }}</ref> \"I thought he was mega but the others were worried what a 15-years-old kid on the road and on the lager would be like. I rang his dad and told him: 'Sorry. But don't worry he's fantastic. He'll go all the way.' And he did. It was the weirdest day when he welcomed me to Oasis. And he hasn't let me forget it.\" White also played drums on [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]'s wife [[Idha (singer)|Idha]]'s solo album, forming a connection with another future [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] member. It was at this session that Noel Gallagher first heard him playing, though he was recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller]]. Prior to joining Oasis, White drummed with London-based band [[Starclub]] and also for Dr Robert, lead singer of [[The Blow Monkeys]].\n\nWhite's brother, [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]], had played with Weller's [[The Style Council]] and various other famous musicians, including [[The Who]]. Because of this connection, Alan mentioned that Steve impacted greatly his development as a drummer. His other influences include [[Keith Moon]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Chad Smith]], [[Mick Avory]], and [[John Bonham]].\n\n===Oasis career (1995\u20132004)===\nWhite replaced original Oasis drummer [[Tony McCarroll]] in May 1995 and was immediately \"thrown in the deep end\", joining the band the very next day to perform a playback of \"[[Some Might Say]]\" in front of a national TV audience on [[BBC1]]'s long running music programme ''[[Top of The Pops]]''. One of White's first live shows with Oasis was in front of a massive crowd at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 1995.\n\nUntil the arrival of [[Andy Bell (bassist)|Andy Bell]] in the Autumn of 1999, White was the token southerner in the otherwise [[Manchester|Mancunian]] Oasis.  Initially known as 'Whitey', he was later re-christened 'Dave' by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from \"The Winchester\" in the '70s TV series ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]''. White commented on the \"North/South divide\" saying it was not that bad, but \"for ages I was the 'Cockney cunt' and they were the 'Manc fuckers'\". In his book ''What's the Story?'' Ian Robertson (who served as Oasis' tour manager from 1994 to 1995) stated that White was also known by the phrase \"Alan White \u2013 He's alright\".\nWhite was also entrusted with the job of being [[Liam Gallagher]]'s 'official' drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together the pair were known as '[[Bert and Ernie]]', named after the [[Sesame Street]]-characters. In December 2002 Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a German bar. Consequently, [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] lost some of his front teeth, and White needed a brain scan after suffering minor head injuries. Both were arrested by the authorities and were released only after the band's management paid for their bail.\n\nNoel Gallagher has stated that White had a far greater significance to the band than a mere session and touring drummer, claiming that he helped immensely in the recording process. Noel also said that when he wrote a song he would play it to White who would often adapt the rhythm of the song or advise Gallagher on possible changes in the tempo.<ref>Getting High: The Adventures of Oasis by Paolo Hewitt</ref> On the other hand, Oasis producer [[Owen Morris]] described White as \"essentially a jazz drummer\" who \"was always shuffling away on his snare [...] and never hitting the basic back beats in a big dumb rock and roll way\", feeling that he did not understand Oasis' sound as well as McCarroll.<ref name=\"owen morris\">{{cite web|url=http://owenmorris.net/oasis/|title=The Rise and Fall of Me Recording Oasis|last=Morris|first=Owen|website=owenmorris.net|access-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112003701/http://owenmorris.net/oasis/|archivedate=12 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of his departure White was the longest-serving member in Oasis beside the Gallaghers (he has since been passed by [[Gem Archer]] and [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]) and passed through thick and thin with the brothers despite being struck down several times with bouts of alleged [[tendinitis]] during his later years with the band.
