Preston''' is a leading proponent of a Christian [[eschatological]] view known as Full [[Preterism]], which claims that all Biblical prophecies, including all the prophecies of the New Testament, were fulfilled in A.D. 70 at the fall of Jerusalem. He is President of the [[Preterist Research Institute]] in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma]].\n\n== Biography ==\nDon was a 1975 graduate of the Northside School of Preaching, (seminary) Harrison, Arkansas. Don has been in public speaking since the age of 13 and was voted among the Jaycees\u2019 \u201cOutstanding Young Men of America,\u201d 1980. Don\u2019s preaching ministry has spanned nearly four decades in two different cities; Shawnee and Ardmore, Oklahoma. Don worked for seven years helping to produce a television program for a Christian magazine which received national recognition in the magazine, \u201cChristianity Today.\u201d\n\nIn June 2010, Don received an honorary Doctorate degree from Vision International University of Romona, California, in recognition of his \u201coutstanding accomplishments in ministry and publishing.\u201d Vision International has 140,000 students worldwide. Dr. Stan DeKoven stated at the graduation ceremony, attended by an estimated 1,000 people, that Vision seldom awards honorary Doctorate degrees, and never more than one per year.\n\nDon is a prolific author, having written multiple book titles which can be found on Amazon.com and at the BP Store.  Some of Preston\u2019s works have been translated into six different languages, and reprinted several times.\n\nDon\u2019s most popular book, Who is this Babylon?, a study of Revelation, has received international critical acclaim. Don\u2019s largest book to date, \u201cWe Shall Meet Him In The Air: The Wedding of the King of kings\u201d (2010 ed.), is the very first, and only, full length (450+ pages) commentary on 1 Thessalonians 4 from the preterist (fulfilled) perspective. Dr. Preston\u2019s writings have appeared in almost every major religious periodical of the Churches of Christ.\n\nDr. Preston has participated in several formal public debates as well as radio debates. His opponents include some of the leading evangelical leaders of the day, including:\n\n\u2013  Joel McDurmon, Ph.D., president of American Vision and author of more than 20 books, and his Senior Fellow is Gary DeMar\n\n\u2013  David Hester, adjunct professor at Faulkner University in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n\u2013  Michael Brown, president and professor at Fellowship for International Revival and Evangelism School of Ministry, is a Pentecostal, radio host of \u201cThe Line of Fire,\u201d and author.\n\n\u2013  Steve Gregg, author, radio host of \u201cThe Narrow Path\u201d bible answer program, and instructor.\n\n\u2013  Jason Wallace, Pastor, counter-cult evangelist, student of James White.\n\n\u2013  Harold Eberle, of Worldcast Ministries, and author.\n\n\u2013  Thomas Ice, co-founder with Tim Lahaye, of the Pre-Trib Research Center.\n\n\u2013  George Westlake Jr., radio host and Bible expert for \u201cLiving Answers for Today\u201d bible answer program.\n\n\u2013  Harold Hoehner of Dallas Theological Seminary.\n\n\u2013  David Engelsma of Reformed Theological Seminary.\n\n\u2013  Marvin Pate of Moody College.\n\n\u2013  F. Lagard Smith, Professor of Law at Faulkner University\u2019s Jones School of Law in Montgomery, Alabama, author, and compiler and narrator of \u201cThe Daily Bible,\u201d the NIV in chronological order.\n\n\u2013  \u2026and many other notable theologians.\n\nIn 2012, Dr. Preston participated in the 2012 Criswell College Theological Lectures on the topic, \u201cFuture Kingdom: Perspectives on the Millennial Reign of Christ.\u201d The forum contained renowned speakers Craig Blaising, Craig L. Blomberg, G. K. Beale, Kenneth H. Gentry, and H. Wayne House, who each presented the various views on the millennium and was laughed at on the stage for his neo-Docetist teachings that Christ lost His humanity in the Ascension.\n\nDr. Preston has participated in live interviews on Christian talk shows such as \u201cSalt and Light\u201d in St. Louis, Missouri, the Gianni Hayes syndicated program, and numerous others. Preston is also co-host with William Bell, on a radio program called \u201cTwo Guys and A Bible\u201d heard live every Tuesday evening on \u201cFulfilled Radio.\u201d\n\nThe ministry website for the Preterist Research Institute (PRI) is www.eschatology.org. In addition to that website, Dr. Preston is also the personal owner of www.bibleprophecy.com, one of the top rated sites for the study of prophecy on the web. The websites contain many articles written by Don and other highly esteemed writers from around the country, in addition to other resources that aim to advance the fulfilled Gospel message.\n\nDr. Preston served as minister for the Ardmore Church of Christ, (now The Family of God church) for 16 years from 1992 to 2008. He resigned to devote himself full time to research, writing, seminars and debates through the organization he founded, PRI. PRI also sponsors an annual conference (Preterist Pilgrim Weekend \u2013 PPW) at the Ardmore Convention Center with attendees who have come from all 50 states, and numerous international locations over the past several years, which has grown in attendance nearly every year.  What began as a simple seminar with only a few people, has now grown into a staple \u201cmust come\u201d event for many since the inception of the PPW.\n\nDon\u2019s hobbies include collecting and restoring classic cars (especially early mustangs), and old pickups; fishing, hunting, internet research, reading, and many others.\n\n== Author ==\nPreston has written many book titles which can be found on Amazon.com and on his own websites. His works have been translated into multiple languages and have been reprinted several times.\n\nDon Preston's most popular book, \"Who is this Babylon?\", which covers the [[Revelation of Saint John the Divine|Revelation]], got a book review where he was not given a positive nor a negative review. Preston's longest book to date, \"We Shall Meet Him In The Air: The Wedding of the King of kings\" (2010 ed.), is the very first, and only, full length commentary on [[1 Thessalonians]] 4 from the [[Preterist]] perspective. Preston's writings have appeared in almost every major religious periodical of the [[Churches of Christ]].\n\nIn Preston's book, \"We Shall Meet Him in the Air; the Wedding of the King of Kings\" (2010 ed.), he has made controversial claims that many have taken to be a denial of the necessity of the blood of Christ in Christian atonement.\n\nIn this book he states: \"What we intend to do now is to demonstrate that the death of Adam, which is the focus of Christ's end time resurrection work, has nothing to do with biological death, but with the loss of spiritual fellowship with God.\"<ref>Don K. Preston, \"We Shall Meet Him in the Air; The Wedding of the King of Kings, page 4.</ref>\n\nHe also states in that same book: \"To say Christ died a substitutionary death is to agree with scripture. However, to say that the focus of Christ's substitutionary death was his physical death is to effectively say that his substitutionary death  is ineffective, or it says that no one has ever entered into the benefit of his death.\"<ref>\"Don K. Preston, \"We Shall Meet Him in the Air; The Wedding of the King of Kings, pages 12\u201313.</ref>\n\nTo many, these controversial statements directly conflict with the Christian Bible and no serious bible student nor scholar agrees with him on this. A small number of people mostly online claim that this has always been the direct intent of Scripture, that is, that The Death, being spiritual death, is and must be the only death for which Christ Jesus restored us from that once lost relationship to God the Father which they perpetually give no good proof for.\n\nThe claim that Preston claims that Christ divested himself of his humanity in the Ascension has been quite a weak argument for Mr. Preston.\n\nHis election arguments have been debunked as pseudo linguistics by virtually every Greek speaking person ever in the history of mankind.\n\n== Debates ==\nPreston has participated in several formal public debates as well as radio debates. His opponents include some of the leading evangelical leaders of the day, including: Joel McDurmon, of [[American Vision]]; Harold Eberle, of Worldcast Ministries; [[Thomas Ice]], co-founder with [[Tim Lahaye]], of the Pre-Trib Research Center; Dr. George Westlake Jr., radio host and [[Bible]] expert for \"Living Answers for Today,\" [[Harold Hoehner]] of [[Dallas Theological Seminary]]; Dr. David Engelsma of [[Reformed Theological Seminary]]; C. Marvin Pate of Moody College; Dr. F. Lagard Smith; and other notable theologians.\n\nIn 2012, Preston participated in the 2012 [[Criswell College]] Theological Lectures on the topic, \"Future Kingdom: Perspectives on the Millennial Reign of Christ.\" The forum contained speakers [[Craig Blaising]], [[Craig L. Blomberg]], [[G. K. Beale]], [[Kenneth Gentry|Kenneth H. Gentry]], and H. Wayne House, who each presented the various views on [[Millennialism|The Millennium]].\n\nNotably, Preston has challenged to debate against Samuel M. Frost who was a one time well known preterist.\n\n== Radio ==\nPreston has participated in live interviews on Christian talk shows such as \"Salt and Light\" in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the Gianni Hayes syndicated program, and numerous others.

The film [[Lead role|stars]] [[Jane Fonda]], [[Felicity Huffman]] and [[Lindsay Lohan]], with [[Supporting role|supporting cast]] [[Dermot Mulroney]], [[Garrett Hedlund]] and [[Cary Elwes]]. The original [[film score|music score]] was composed by [[John Debney]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but the lead cast was praised for their performances.\n\n==Plot==\nRebellious and uncontrollable, seventeen year-old Rachel is promiscuous, does drugs, and drinks. With her latest car crash, Rachel has violated the final rule in the San Francisco home of her mother, Lily. With nowhere else to take the impulsive and rambunctious girl, Lily hauls her daughter to the one place she swore she would never return to: her own mother's house in Idaho. \n\nMatriarch Georgia lives her life by a number of unbreakable rules \u2014 God comes first, and hard work comes a very close second \u2014 and she wants that whoever shares her home to do the same. Now saddled with raising the young woman, it requires each patient breath she takes to understand Rachel's fury. Georgia arranges a job for Rachel as the office girl of Dr. Simon Ward, the local veterinarian, who also unofficially treats people. His two nephews, Sam and Ethan, are often at Georgia's house. \n\nSimon does not show interest in Rachel or other women; so, she thinks he is gay. However, Simon's sister Paula reveals that he is still mourning the death of his wife and son who were killed in a car collision three years earlier. He refuses to have sex with Rachel even when she tries to seduce him, but retains some feelings for her mother Lily, whom he has dated in the past.\n\nRachel performs oral sex on Harlan Wilson, who was not yet married and still a virgin because of his [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS (Mormon) religion]]. He confesses to his LDS girlfriend, June, who is shocked. Later, a team of LDS girls spy on Harlan to make sure he does not have sex again as well as on Rachel. \n\nAfter almost running them over with Harlan's truck, Rachel explains to them that what happened was over and that they can go back to having their summer fun. \n\nThey agree to do so, but they tell Rachel to go home leading Rachel to threaten them by saying if they have anything to do with her and Harlan again, she will find all of their boyfriends and \"fuck them stupid\". That is the point when they stop insulting her and end their spying on Harlan and Rachel. \n\nWhile trying to make a point to Simon about survival, Rachel bluntly says that her stepfather, Arnold, sexually molested her from the time she was 12 until she turned 14. Seeing the effect of her revelation, Rachel tries to convince him she lied. However, Simon tells Georgia about the abuse, and in turn, Georgia tells Lily, who thinks Rachel is lying. \n\nHeartbroken, Lily comes to believe her daughter. She begins to drink heavily and asks Arnold for a divorce. When Arnold arrives, Georgia tells him to leave and refuses to let him in the house. Finally, she forces him to leave by hitting him with a baseball bat. When he still refuses to leave the property, she threatens to vandalize his new red Ferrari. Rachel sees that Lily cannot accept the truth, and lies to her about being molested.\n\nAt the motel where Arnold is staying, Rachel tells him that she has a video tape of them having sex when she was 14 and Arnold seems worried. Rachel demands $10 million if he does not keep Lily happy. She admits to him that she told Lily lies because she does not want her to be upset anymore. On the way back to San Francisco, Arnold tells Lily that he is giving Rachel his Ferrari, and Lily realizes that he is guilty.\n\nLily starts a raging argument/attack and Arnold finally admits to having molested Rachel numerous times, using the excuse that Rachel seduced him, Lily's alcoholism drove him to it, and that Rachel enjoyed it. So, Arnold drives off and leaves Lily to walk home. Georgia, Simon, Rachel and Harlan catch up with Lily in Harlan's pick-up truck, and a tearful Rachel apologizes to her mother for her behavior. Harlan tells Georgia that he is in love with Rachel, and plans to marry her when he returns from his two-year mission.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Rachel Wilcox\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Georgia Randall\n* [[Felicity Huffman]] as Lily Wilcox\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Simon Ward\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Harlan Wilson\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Paula Richards\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Arnold\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Izzy\n* [[Dylan McLaughlin]] as Sam\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as Ethan\n* Tereza Stanislav as Violin Teacher\n* [[Fred Applegate (actor)|Fred Applegate]] as Townie #1\n* Cynthia Ferrer as Townie #2\n* [[Destiney Sue Moore|Destiney Moore]] as Waitress\n* [[Christine Lakin]] as Grace\n* [[Chelse Swain]] as June Smith\n* [[Shea Curry]] as Melodee\n* [[Michael Clifford (singer)|Michael Clifford]] as Michael\n\n==Production==\nOstensibly set in Idaho, per the ending credits and DVD extras, the film was actually shot in [[Southern California]], and much of the scenery was created with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Georgia Rule'' was panned by critics.

It is the suburban region of business city of Kumbakonam.\n\nThirunageswaram is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Chamapaka forest and hence called Chamapakavanam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Alayam - The Hindu temple - An epitome of Hindu Culture|pages=10, 31|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|year=2013|location=Mylapore, Chennai|last=Reddy|first=G.Venkatramana|isbn=978-81-7823-542-4}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Thirunageswaram had a population of 9,814. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Thirunageswaram has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 65%. In Thirunageswaram, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nThe town receives a lot of rainfall every year (220&nbsp;cm) and  is known for its extremely fertile land and chief crops include Rice, Wheat and Corn. Coconut and Mango farms are also found in abundance.\n\n==Temples at Thirunageswaram==\nThere are two major temples at Thirunageswaram. One of them is the famous [[Vaishnavite]] temple of '''Oppliyappan''' ([[Oppliyappan Sannadhi]]), the other the [[Rahu stalam|Thiru Nageswarar]] or '''Naganatha Swami''' temple for [[Shaivites]].\n\n===Oppliyappan Sannadhi===\n{{Main|Oppliyappan Sannadhi}}\nOppliyappan temple attracts pilgrims throughout the year. Ramanavami is celebrated every year in a grand manner in the months of April/May. Thirukalyanam and Kanakibishekam are the two important events in Ramanavami festival. This temple food is always done without salt in any food. No one should ever take anything that contains salt into this temple.\n\n===Naganatha Swami temple===\n{{Main|Rahu stalam}}\nNaganatha Swami (Naga in Tamil/Sanskrit means Snake and Natha means God) is a temple dedicated to [[Shiva]]. An important feature of Naganatha Swami temple is that of [[Rahu]] bhagawan (one of the nine celestial bodies) sannathi. It is the 29th in the series of Tevara Stalams located south of the [[river Kaveri]]. Here milk [[abhishekam]] is performed daily during [[Rahukaalam]]. At this time, the milk that is poured on the statue turns blue when it passes over the body and once again to white after it reaches the floor.

Thirunageswaram is located 6&nbsp;km east of [[Kumbakonam]]. It is the suburban region of business city of Kumbakonam.\n\nThirunageswaram is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Chamapaka forest and hence called Chamapakavanam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Alayam - The Hindu temple - An epitome of Hindu Culture|page=10, 31|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|year=2013|location=Mylapore, Chennai|last=Reddy|first=G.Venkatramana|isbn=978-81-7823-542-4}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Thirunageswaram had a population of 9,814. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Thirunageswaram has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 65%. In Thirunageswaram, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nThe town receives a lot of rainfall every year (220&nbsp;cm) and  is known for its extremely fertile land and chief crops include Rice, Wheat and Corn. Coconut and Mango farms are also found in abundance.\n\n==Temples at Thirunageswaram==\nThere are two major temples at Thirunageswaram. One of them is the famous [[Vaishnavite]] temple of '''Oppliyappan''' ([[Oppliyappan Sannadhi]]), the other the [[Rahu stalam|Thiru Nageswarar]] or '''Naganatha Swami''' temple for [[Shaivites]].\n\n===Oppliyappan Sannadhi===\n{{Main|Oppliyappan Sannadhi}}\nOppliyappan temple attracts pilgrims throughout the year. Ramanavami is celebrated every year in a grand manner in the months of April/May. Thirukalyanam and Kanakibishekam are the two important events in Ramanavami festival. This temple food is always done without salt in any food. No one should ever take anything that contains salt into this temple.\n\n===Naganatha Swami temple===\n{{Main|Rahu stalam}}\nNaganatha Swami (Naga in Tamil/Sanskrit means Snake and Natha means God) is a temple dedicated to [[Lord Shiva]]. An important feature of Naganatha Swami temple is that of [[Rahu]] bhagawan (one of the nine celestial bodies) sannathi. It is the 29th in the series of Tevara Stalams located south of the [[river Kaveri]]. Here milk [[abhishekam]] is performed daily during [[Rahukaalam]]. At this time, the milk that is poured on the statue turns blue when it passes over the body and once again to white after it reaches the floor. This wonder is watched by many daily during the Raahu Kaalam. This is also the only place wherein one can view Rahu bhagawan with his consorts.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

They then pursued [[Austria]]n manufacturer Elin to produce a propulsion system for the prototype while they awaited Rockwell. Changes to the propulsion system necessitated changes to the streetcar design in order for the streetcar to accommodate a different form factor; this ultimately delayed the project and raised the cost of manufacturing.<ref name=\"oreg-2011jul19\">{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Brad |title=Portland's $148.3 million eastside streetcar project delayed five months, includes five streetcars instead of six |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 19, 2011 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/07/portlands_1483_million_eastsid.html |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Opening and closing of the loop===\n\nThe streetcar extension opened on September 22, 2012, after a five-month-long delay.<ref name=\"PS-History\">{{cite web|title=Streetcar History |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/33 |publisher=Portland Streetcar |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013400/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/33 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Brad |date=July 19, 2011 |title=Portland's $148.3 million eastside streetcar project delayed five months, includes five streetcars instead of six |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/07/portlands_1483_million_eastsid.html |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> Its inaugural service, branded the Central Loop Line (abbreviated as CL Line), ran {{convert|4.4|mi|km}} total from the NS Line tracks at Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to the Pearl District, then on the new tracks from the Broadway Bridge to OMSI in Southeast Portland.<ref name=\"PS-History\"/> Service along the eastside segment initially operated with frequencies of 18 minutes instead of an originally planned 15 minutes due to funding cuts by TriMet and the City of Portland, as well as delays in streetcar delivery from United Streetcar.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Rose (journalist) |date=September 21, 2012 |title=Portland Streetcar's eastside loop gets off to hobbled start Saturday |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2012/09/portland_streetcars_eastside_l.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref> The first car finally arrived in January 2013 and entered service on June 11, 2013.<ref name=\"oreg-2013jun12\">{{cite news|last=Schmidt|first=Brad|title=New streetcar rolls out in Portland<!--(print-edition headline)--> |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 12, 2013 |page=B1 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/06/after_repeated_delays_portland.html |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}</ref> Fares were $1 upon opening due to TriMet's elimination of the [[Fareless Square|Free Rail Zone]].<ref>{{cite news |date=October 5, 2012 |title=Portland Streetcar Introduces 'Central Loop' Service |url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/aptapt/issues/2012-10-05/3.html |work=Passenger Transport |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> Approximately 3,200 riders per weekday used the line during the first two weeks of service.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2012/10/31/eastside-streetcar-carrying-the-wait.html |last=Giegerich |first=Andy |title=Eastside streetcar: Carrying the wait |newspaper=Portland Business Journal |date=October 31, 2012 |access-date=April 5, 2020}}</ref> \n\n[[File:A Lloyd via Peral (21612375879).jpg|thumb|left|An A Loop streetcar on Tilikum Crossing in 2015]]\n\nThe second phase of the Eastside Loop project, referred to as \"Close the Loop\", extended the streetcar {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} from OMSI to the NS Line tracks on Southwest Moody Avenue in the [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/321180 |title=Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan: A Framework for Future Corridor Planning and Alternatives Analysis |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |date=September 9, 2009 |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|50}} This phase had awaited the construction of a new bridge for the Portland\u2013Milwaukie light rail project.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Nasser-Ali then goes on a quest to find a new violin, but after purchasing a Stradivarius and attempting to play it, he realizes that he has lost his will to play and therefore to live. After contemplating various methods of suicide he finally decides to take to his bed and simply die there.\n\nWhile in bed, he reflects on his life and images from his past and future play out before him. In a vision of the future his eldest daughter Lili marries a man her mother approves of, divorces him, and then has a passionate affair with an actor. After the actor dies of a heart attack Lili smokes, drinks and becomes addicted to gambling, eventually suffering three heart attacks and finally dying after the third. His younger son, meanwhile, ends up in America with multiple children and becomes a grandfather after his overweight daughter goes to the hospital with stomach pains and gives birth to a son she names Jimmy-Nassar.\n\nIn the midst of his attempts to die, Faranguisse, finally concerned, cooks Nasser-Ali his favourite dish of chicken with plums. It is revealed that Faranguisse was in love with Nasser-Ali from the time she was a child, and waited for him as he became a famous musician and toured the world. Upon his return, his mother ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) pressured him into marrying Faranguisse. Faranguisse attempts to feed Nasser-Ali the chicken with plums but he rejects it, reiterating that he will never forgive her for destroying his violin.\n\nOn the fifth day, finding himself still alive, he remembers that when his mother was dying she asked him to stop praying for her as his prayers were keeping her alive and she was in pain. When he stopped praying, her soul became a cloud of smoke which appeared over her grave. As it turns out, Nassar-Ali's youngest son is praying for him.\n\nOn the sixth day he hallucinates that he sees the angel of death. Though Nassar-Ali tells the angel he has changed his mind and no longer wishes to die, the angel tells Nassar-Ali it is too late.\n\nOn the final day of his life, Nassar-Ali dreams of Irane ([[Golshifteh Farahani]]). Nassar-Ali met Irane when he was studying the violin and was told by his teacher that while his technique was beautiful, his music lacked soul. Later Nassar-Ali saw Irane walking in the street and followed her to her father's clock store. Buying a clock from her father, he damaged it multiple times so he could return to the store and bump into her. After falling in love, Nassar-Ali proposes to Irane and she accepts. Her father, however, forbids their marriage on the grounds that Nassar-Ali will be unable to financially take care of his daughter. Irane eventually complies with her father's wishes. His music teacher tells Nassar-Ali that the heartbreak he has undergone has finally transformed him into a great musician, a musician with soul, and gives him a violin that belonged to his own teaching instructor.  Nassar-Ali begins a twenty-year tour of the world, while Irane marries and has a child and eventually becomes a grandmother just as Nassar-Ali returns, marries and begins having children.\n\nAfter buying a replacement for the violin that Faranguisse broke, Nassar-Ali runs into Irane who is walking with her grandson. After calling her name and asking if she remembers him, Irane replies that she doesn't, leaving him heartbroken. Irane does, however, remember him and after turning the corner she begins to cry.\n\nNassar-Ali finally dies on his eighth day in bed. Irane attends the funeral in secret.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as  Nasser Ali Khan's mother\n* [[Maria de Medeiros]] as Faranguisse\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Ir\u00e2ne\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Nasser-Ali\n* [[Jamel Debbouze]] as Houchang\n* [[Chiara Mastroianni]] as Lili (as adult)\n* [[Edouard Baer]] as Azra\u00ebl\n* [[Eric Caravaca]] as Abdi\n* [[Didier Flamand]] as The Music Master\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced in Germany in 2010 at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in [[Potsdam]].

Nasser-Ali then goes on a quest to find a new violin, but after purchasing a Stradivarius and attempting to play it, he realizes that he has lost his will to play and therefore to live. After contemplating various methods of suicide he finally decides to take to his bed and simply die there.\n\nWhile in bed, he reflects on his life and images from his past and future play out before him. In a vision of the future his eldest daughter Lili marries a man her mother approves of, divorces him, and then has a passionate affair with an actor. After the actor dies of a heart attack Lili smokes, drinks and becomes addicted to gambling, eventually suffering three heart attacks and finally dying after the third. His younger son, meanwhile, ends up in America with multiple children and becomes a grandfather after his overweight daughter goes to the hospital with stomach pains and gives birth to a son she names Jimmy-Nassar.\n\nIn the midst of his attempts to die, Faranguisse, finally concerned, cooks Nasser-Ali his favourite dish of chicken with plums. It is revealed that Faranguisse was in love with Nasser-Ali from the time she was a child, and waited for him as he became a famous musician and toured the world. Upon his return, his mother ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) pressured him into marrying Faranguisse. Faranguisse attempts to feed Nasser-Ali the chicken with plums but he rejects it, reiterating that he will never forgive her for destroying his violin.\n\nOn the fifth day, finding himself still alive, he remembers that when his mother was dying she asked him to stop praying for her as his prayers were keeping her alive and she was in pain. When he stopped praying, her soul became a cloud of smoke which appeared over her grave. As it turns out, Nassar-Ali's youngest son is praying for him.\n\nOn the sixth day he hallucinates that he sees the angel of death. Though Nassar-Ali tells the angel he has changed his mind and no longer wishes to die, the angel tells Nassar-Ali it is too late.\n\nOn the final day of his life, Nassar-Ali dreams of Irane ([[Golshifteh Farahani]]). Nassar-Ali met Irane when he was studying the violin and was told by his teacher that while his technique was beautiful, his music lacked soul. Later Nassar-Ali saw Irane walking in the street and followed her to her father's clock store. Buying a clock from her father, he damaged it multiple times so he could return to the store and bump into her. After falling in love, Nassar-Ali proposes to Irane and she accepts. Her father, however, forbids their marriage on the grounds that Nassar-Ali will be unable to financially take care of his daughter. Irane eventually complies with her father's wishes. His music teacher tells Nassar-Ali that the heartbreak he has undergone has finally transformed him into a great musician, a musician with soul, and gives him a violin that belonged to his own teaching instructor.  Nassar-Ali begins a twenty-year tour of the world, while Irane marries and has a child and eventually becomes a grandmother just as Nassar-Ali returns, marries and begins having children.\n\nAfter buying a replacement for the violin that Faranguisse broke, Nassar-Ali runs into Irane who is walking with her grandson. After calling her name and asking if she remembers him, Irane replies that she doesn't, leaving him heartbroken. Irane does, however, remember him and after turning the corner she begins to cry.\n\nNassar-Ali finally dies on his eighth day in bed. Irane attends the funeral in secret.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as  Nasser Ali Khan's mother\n* [[Maria de Medeiros]] as Faranguisse\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Ir\u00e2ne\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Nasser-Ali\n* [[Jamel Debbouze]] as Houchang\n* [[Chiara Mastroianni]] as Lili (as adult)\n* [[Edouard Baer]] as Azra\u00ebl\n* [[Eric Caravaca]] as Abdi\n* [[Didier Flamand]] as The Music Master\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced in Germany in 2010 at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in [[Potsdam]].

BAKAMLA is a non-ministerial government institution which reports directly to the President through [[Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs (Indonesia)|Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs]]. BAKAMLA's duty is to conduct security and safety patrols in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the jurisdiction of Indonesia. Previously BAKAMLA was a non-structural institution called the Coordinating Agency for the Security of the Republic of Indonesia ({{lang-id|Badan Koordinasi Keamanan Laut Republik Indonesia \u2013 Bakorkamla}}). The agency is not part or associated with the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], although its top-ranking leadership are handpicked from the [[Indonesian Navy]]. BAKAMLA and the Indonesian Navy, however, often conduct exercises and joint-operation together.

The difference between navy and BAKAMLA rank are the usage of special title (BAKAMLA uses special title of \"Bakamla\" for every personnel, while navy uses \"(TNI)\" for high-ranking officer and branch/corps abbreviation for other officer and enlisted personnel) and BAKAMLA does not have a rank higher than a [[Vice admiral]] as Vice Admiral is the rank of the head of the agency. Despite similarity on the title, BAKAMLA uses different insignia. [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] personnel who are assigned to BAKAMLA are allowed to keep his/her military rank and in the case of the Navy, specialty rating.\n\n'''Note''': BAKAMLA is not part of Indonesian National Armed Forces and Indonesia is not a member of [[NATO]], so there is no official equivalence between BAKAMLA ranks and those defined by NATO.

And through a series of seminars and cross-sectoral coordination meeting, then on 29 December 2005, it was determined the Presidential Regulation No. 81 Year 2005 on Maritime Security Coordinating Board (''Badan Koordinasi Keamanan Laut/ Bakorkamla'') as the legal basis of the Maritime Security Coordinating Board.\n\nFollowing the enactment of Law No. 32 Year 2014 concerning the Marine, Bakorkamla officially renamed the Maritime Security Agency or Badan Kemananan Laut (BAKAMLA). Legal basis for BAKAMLA was then reinforced by the issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 178 of 2014 on Maritime Security Agency.\n\n== Function ==\nThe task of BAKAMLA is to conduct security and safety patrols in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the jurisdiction of Indonesia.\n\n* Establish national policies in the field of security and safety in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the jurisdiction of Indonesia;\n* Organize security and safety early warning systems in Indonesian waters and jurisdiction areas;\n* Carry out safeguards, supervision, prevention and prosecution of law violations in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the jurisdiction of Indonesia;\n* Coordinate and monitor the execution of water patrol with relevant agencies;\n* Provide technical and operational support to related institutions;\n* Provide search and rescue assistance in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the territory of Indonesian jurisdiction;\n\nAccording to Presidential Regulation No. 178 of 2014 on Maritime Security Agency, BAKAMLA has the authority to: a. conduct an immediate pursuit; b. dismiss, examine, arrest, carry, and deliver vessels to relevant authorities for further legal process execution; and c. synergize the information system of security and safety in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the jurisdiction of Indonesia.\n\n== Vision and Mission ==\n* To be Professional and trustworthy maritime security agency in both national and international maritime community to support the creation of a sovereign, independent and personality based on mutual cooperation.\n* To create National and International maritime security capable of maintaining security and safety in the territorial waters of Indonesia and the jurisdiction of Indonesia and reflecting the personality of Indonesia as an archipelago country.\n* To protect sovereignty of Indonesia, independent and strengthen identity as a maritime country through BAKAMLA as the guardian of the world maritime axis.\n*[[File:KNKudaLaut.jpg|thumb|KN Kuda Laut of BAKAMLA during a patrol in [[Ambon, Maluku]].]][[File:Kapalbakamla.jpg|thumb|Two BAKAMLA patrol boats during a patrol.]]The realization of developing Indonesia into an independent maritime nation, strong forward and based on the national interest.\n\n==Organisation==\n\nAccording to presidential decree No. 178/ 2014,<ref>{{cite web|lang=id|url=http://jakartagreater.com/inilah-perpres-no-1782014-tentang-pembentukan-badan-keamanan-laut/ |title=Inilah Perpres No. 178/2014 Tentang Pembentukan Badan Keamanan Laut  |publisher=jakartagreater.com |date=14 July 2014 |access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> the organisation structure of the BAKAMLA comprises the following components:\n\n* Head of BAKAMLA\n*** Law Enforcement Unit\n*** Inspectorate\n*** Task Forces\n** Secretary of BAKAMLA\n*** Bureau of Planning and Organization\n*** Bureau of General Affairs\n*** Bureau of Infrastructure\n** Deputy of Information, Law and Cooperation.\n*** Directorate of Data and Information\n*** Directorate of Law\n*** Directorate of Cooperation\n** Deputy of Operation and Training\n*** Directorate of Naval Operation\n*** Directorate of Naval Aviation Operation\n*** Directorate of Training\n** Deputy of Policy and Strategy\n*** Directorate of Marine Security Policy\n*** Directorate of Marine Security Strategy\n*** Directorate of Marine Security Research and Development\n** Head of Western Maritime Zone Office\n** Head of Central Maritime Zone Office\n** Head of Eastern Maritime Zone Office\n\n=== Academy ===\nThe Marine Safety and Security Academy ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian:]] ''Akademi Keselamatan dan Keamanan Laut, AKKL'') is the main training institute for BAKAMLA candidates.

As BAKAMLA is not part of the Indonesian National Armed Forces and have different roles and functions, they are not issued with heavy weaponry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/3136540/situasi-ini-memungkinkan-BAKAMLA-kontak-senjata-saat-jaga-keamanan-laut|title=Situasi Ini Memungkinkan BAKAMLA Kontak Senjata Saat Jaga Keamanan Laut|last=Irawan|first=Dhani|work=detiknews|access-date=2018-02-07|lang=id}}</ref>\n\n==Rank Structure==\nThe BAKAMLA uses a similar ranking system with [[Indonesian Navy]]. The difference between navy and BAKAMLA rank are the usage of special title (BAKAMLA uses special title of \"Bakamla\" for every personnel, while navy uses \"(TNI)\" for high-ranking officer and branch/corps abbreviation for other officer and enlisted personnel) and BAKAMLA does not have a rank higher than a [[Vice admiral]] as Vice Admiral is the rank of the head of the agency. Despite similarity on the title, BAKAMLA uses different insignia. [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] personnel who are assigned to BAKAMLA are allowed to keep his/her military rank and in the case of the Navy, specialty rating.\n\n'''Note''': BAKAMLA is not part of Indonesian National Armed Forces and Indonesia is not a member of [[NATO]], so there is no official equivalence between BAKAMLA ranks and those defined by NATO. The displayed parallel is approximate and for illustration purposes only.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"min-width:40%; border: 2px solid #0066FF; width: 100%; \"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#0066FF; color:white\"|\n!colspan=13 style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em;text-align:center; background:#0066FF; color:white;\"|Ranks and Insignias - Maritime Security Agency\n|-\n|-\n| colspan=14 ; style=\"text-align:center\" |\n\n===Officers===\n\n|- style=\"background-color:#CCCCCC; font-weight:bold;\" align=\"center; width: 100%\"\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|NATO code ||style=\"background:lightgray\"| || <center>OF-10</center>||<center>OF-9</center>||<center>OF-8</center>||<center>OF-7</center>||<center>OF-6</center>||<center>OF-5</center>||<center>OF-4</center>||<center>OF-3</center>||<center>OF-2</center>||colspan=2|<center>OF-1</center>||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|{{INA}}\n  |style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n  |\n  |\n  |[[File:Laksdya maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Laksma maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Laksda maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Kol maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Letkol maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Mayor maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Kapten maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Lettu maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Letda maritim.png|60px]]|| style=\"background:lightgray\" |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''Laksamana Madya Bakamla''\n  |''Laksamana Muda Bakamla''\n  |''Laksamana Pertama Bakamla''\n  |''Kolonel Bakamla''\n  |''Letnan Kolonel Bakamla''\n  |''Mayor Bakamla''\n  |''Kapten Bakamla''\n  |''Letnan Satu Bakamla''\n  |''Letnan Dua Bakamla''||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|English ||style=\"background:lightgray\"| || - || - || [[Vice Admiral]] Bakamla ||[[Rear Admiral]] Bakamla ||[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Bakamla ||[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Bakamla ||[[Commander]] Bakamla ||[[Lieutenant commander]] Bakamla ||[[Captain lieutenant|Captain-Lieutenant]] Bakamla ||[[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] Bakamla ||[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Bakamla||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Civil Servant Grade||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |IV/c\n  |IV/c or IV/b\n  |IV/b\n  |IV/a\n  |IV/a or III/c\n  |III/c \n  |III/b \n  |III/b or III/a\n  |III/a||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n|- style=\"border-top:2px solid #0066FF;\"\n| colspan=99 ; style=\"text-align:center\" |\n\n===Enlisted ratings===\n\n<!-- ARMY NCOs | SUBOFICIALES EJERCITO -->\n|- style=\"background-color:#CCCCCC; font-weight:bold;\" align=\"center\"\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|NATO code ||style=\"background:lightgray\"| ||colspan=2|OR-9||OR-8||OR-7||OR-6||OR-5||OR-4||OR-3||OR-2||colspan=3|OR-1\n|- align=\"center\"\n|{{INA}}\n  |style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n  |\n  |\n  |[[File:Serma maritim.png|60px]] \n  |[[File:Serka maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Sertu maritim.png|60px]]\n  |[[File:Serda maritim.png|60px]] \n  |\n  |\n  |\n  |\n  |\n  |\n|- align=\"center\"\n| [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]\n  |style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''Sersan Mayor Bakamla''\n  |''Sersan Kepala Bakamla''\n  |''Sersan Satu Bakamla''\n  |''Sersan Dua Bakamla''\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''-''||''-''||''-''\n|- align=\"center\"\n|English ||style=\"background:lightgray\"| || - || - |||[[Sergeant Major]] Bakamla||[[Master Sergeant]] Bakamla||[[Staff sergeant]] Bakamla||[[Sergeant]] Bakamla|| - || - || - || - || - ||\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Civil Servant Grade||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |II/d\n  |II/c\n  |II/b\n  |II/a\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''-''\n  |''-''||style=\"background:lightgray\"|\n|}<!-- ARMY NCOs | SUBOFICIALES EJERCITO -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://BAKAMLA.go.id/ BAKAMLA Official Website]\n{{Coast guards}}\n{{Government of Indonesia}}\n{{Law enforcement in Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:Coast guards]]\n", "name_user": "Cal1407", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVessels", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Maritime_Security_Agency"}
