The local climate is well known for the prevalence of [[Foehn wind]]s - where winds from the South pass over the nearby mountains and warm and dry on their descent, leading to far higher temperatures than otherwise might be expected; the area held the Welsh high temperature record for February at 18.7&nbsp;\u00b0C from 23 February 2012 to 24 February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|title=UK climate|first=Met|last=Office|website=www.metoffice.gov.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103004237/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colwyn Bay 36m asl, 1981-2010 \n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.7\n|Mar record high C = 21.4\n|Apr record high C = 24.8\n|May record high C = 28.1\n|Jun record high C = 30.3\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 32.4\n|Sep record high C = 28.3\n|Oct record high C = 27.2\n|Nov record high C = 18.3\n|Dec record high C = 16.4\n|year record high C = 33.0\n|Jan high C = 8.5\n|Feb high C = 8.4\n|Mar high C = 10.3\n|Apr high C = 12.1\n|May high C = 15.2\n|Jun high C = 17.6\n|Jul high C = 19.6\n|Aug high C = 19.4\n|Sep high C = 17.4\n|Oct high C = 14.3\n|Nov high C = 11.1\n|Dec high C = 8.9\n|year high C = 13.6\n|Jan low C = 2.8\n|Feb low C = 2.7\n|Mar low C = 4.1\n|Apr low C = 5.3\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.4\n|Jul low C = 12.5\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.7\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 5.7\n|Dec low C = 3.2\n|year low C = 7.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.9\n|Feb record low C = -7.2\n|Mar record low C = -9.3\n|Apr record low C = -4.2\n|May record low C = -1.7\n|Jun record low C = 2.4\n|Jul record low C = 5.7\n|Aug record low C = 4.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = -3.8\n|Nov record low C = -7.3\n|Dec record low C = -10.4\n|year record low C = -10.4\n|Jan precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 53.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 57.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50.7\n|May precipitation mm = 52.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 56.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 52.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 70.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Dec precipitation mm = 90.2\n|year precipitation mm = 808.7\n|Jan sun = 56.2\n|Feb sun = 81.8\n|Mar sun = 115.0\n|Apr sun = 162.8\n|May sun = 209.0\n|Jun sun = 185.6\n|Jul sun = 189.6\n|Aug sun = 174.7\n|Sep sun = 135.2\n|Oct sun = 108.2\n|Nov sun = 59.9\n|Dec sun = 44.1\n|year sun = 1522.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007095626/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 7 October 2012 | title = Colwyn Bay 1981-2010 averages | accessdate = 24 August 2012 | publisher = [[Met Office]] }}</ref>\n|date=September 2011\n}}\n\n== Demography ==\nPrior to local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974 Colwyn Bay was a [[municipal borough]] with a population of around 25,000, but in 1974 this designation disappeared leaving five separate parishes, known as [[Community (Wales)|communities]] in Wales, of which the one bearing the name Colwyn Bay encompassed just the central part of the overall town and in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] contained just 9,742 people, with the others as follows: [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]] (1,862), [[Rhos-on-Sea]] (7,110), [[Llansanffraid Glan Conwy|Glan Conwy]] (2,290), [[Old Colwyn]] (7,626) and [[Llysfaen]] (2,652).

The local climate is well known for the prevalence of [[Foehn wind]]s - where winds from the South pass over the nearby mountains and warm and dry on their descent, leading to far higher temperatures than otherwise might be expected; the area held the Welsh high temperature record for February at 18.7&nbsp;\u00b0C from 23 February 2012 to 24 February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|title=UK climate|first=Met|last=Office|website=www.metoffice.gov.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103004237/https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-extremes/#?tab=climateExtremes|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Colwyn Bay 36m asl, 1981-2010 \n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.7\n|Mar record high C = 21.4\n|Apr record high C = 24.8\n|May record high C = 28.1\n|Jun record high C = 30.3\n|Jul record high C = 33.0\n|Aug record high C = 32.4\n|Sep record high C = 28.3\n|Oct record high C = 27.2\n|Nov record high C = 18.3\n|Dec record high C = 16.4\n|year record high C = 33.0\n|Jan high C = 8.5\n|Feb high C = 8.4\n|Mar high C = 10.3\n|Apr high C = 12.1\n|May high C = 15.2\n|Jun high C = 17.6\n|Jul high C = 19.6\n|Aug high C = 19.4\n|Sep high C = 17.4\n|Oct high C = 14.3\n|Nov high C = 11.1\n|Dec high C = 8.9\n|year high C = 13.6\n|Jan low C = 2.8\n|Feb low C = 2.7\n|Mar low C = 4.1\n|Apr low C = 5.3\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.4\n|Jul low C = 12.5\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.7\n|Oct low C = 8.1\n|Nov low C = 5.7\n|Dec low C = 3.2\n|year low C = 7.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.9\n|Feb record low C = -7.2\n|Mar record low C = -9.3\n|Apr record low C = -4.2\n|May record low C = -1.7\n|Jun record low C = 2.4\n|Jul record low C = 5.7\n|Aug record low C = 4.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = -3.8\n|Nov record low C = -7.3\n|Dec record low C = -10.4\n|year record low C = -10.4\n|Jan precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 53.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 57.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50.7\n|May precipitation mm = 52.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 56.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 52.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 70.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 89.8\n|Dec precipitation mm = 90.2\n|year precipitation mm = 808.7\n|Jan sun = 56.2\n|Feb sun = 81.8\n|Mar sun = 115.0\n|Apr sun = 162.8\n|May sun = 209.0\n|Jun sun = 185.6\n|Jul sun = 189.6\n|Aug sun = 174.7\n|Sep sun = 135.2\n|Oct sun = 108.2\n|Nov sun = 59.9\n|Dec sun = 44.1\n|year sun = 1522.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007095626/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19812010/sites/colwyn_bay.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 7 October 2012 | title = Colwyn Bay 1981-2010 averages | accessdate = 24 August 2012 | publisher = [[Met Office]] }}</ref>\n|date=September 2011\n}}\n\n== Demography ==\nPrior to local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974 Colwyn Bay was a [[municipal borough]] with a population of around 25,000, but in 1974 this designation disappeared leaving five separate parishes, known as [[Community (Wales)|communities]] in Wales, of which the one bearing the name Colwyn Bay encompassed just the central part of the overall town and in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] contained just 9,742 people, with the others as follows: [[Mochdre, Conwy|Mochdre]] (1,862), [[Rhos-on-Sea]] (7,110), [[Llansanffraid Glan Conwy|Glan Conwy]] (2,290), [[Old Colwyn]] (7,626) and [[Llysfaen]] (2,652). This gives a total figure for the six communities of 31,382, generally referred to as the population of Colwyn Bay, making it the [[List of urban areas in Wales by population|16th largest urban area in Wales]] and the second largest settlement in [[North Wales]]. Bringing 2011 figures into account that figure is now 33,549.

Upon examination it was revealed that it was a [[hydrogen cyanide]] device which, had it not been extinguished in time, would have released enough gas into the ventilation system to potentially kill 10,000 commuters.<ref name=chrono/> On July 4, several undetonated cyanide devices were found at other locations in the Tokyo subway.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/425960/HERES-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-POISON-GAS-ATTACKS-IN-JAPAN.html|title=Here's a chronology of poison gas attacks in Japan|work=[[Deseret News]]| date= July 5, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/07/04/Four-injured-by-Tokyo-station-gas-fumes/1840804830400|title= Four injured by Tokyo station gas fumes|publisher=United Press International|date=4 July 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Jonathan B.|title=Toxic Terror: Assessing Terrorist Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons|date=February 2000|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrPyPP7gkHYC|via=Google Books|accessdate=29 September 2017|isbn=9780262700719}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, numerous cult members were arrested for various offenses, but arrests of the most senior members on the charge of the subway gassing had not yet taken place. In June, an individual unrelated to Aum had launched a copycat attack by hijacking [[All Nippon Airways Flight 857]], a Boeing 747 bound for Hakodate from Tokyo. The hijacker claimed to be an Aum member in possession of sarin and plastic explosives, but these claims were ultimately found to be false.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAsahara was finally found hiding within a wall of a cult building known as \"The 6th Satian\" in the Kamikuishiki complex on 16 May and was arrested.<ref name=chrono/> On the same day, the cult mailed a parcel bomb to the office of [[Yukio Aoshima]], the governor of Tokyo, blowing off the fingers of his secretary's hand. Asahara was initially charged with 23 counts of murder and 16 other offenses. The trial, dubbed \"the trial of the century\" by the press, ruled Asahara guilty of masterminding the attack and [[Capital punishment in Japan|sentenced him to death]]. The indictment was appealed unsuccessfully. A number of senior members accused of participation, such as Masami Tsuchiya, also received death sentences.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe reasons why a small circle of mostly senior Aum members committed atrocities and the extent of personal involvement by Asahara remain unclear, although several theories have attempted to explain these events. In response to the prosecution's charge that Asahara ordered the subway attacks to distract authorities, the defense maintained that Asahara was not aware of events, pointing to his deteriorating health. Shortly after his arrest, Asahara abandoned his post as the organization's leader, and since then has maintained silence, refusing to communicate even with lawyers and family members.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===After 1995===\n[[File:Anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest.JPG|thumb|300px|An anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest in Japan, 2009.]]\nOn 21 June 1995, Asahara acknowledged that in January 1994 he ordered the killing of a sect member, Kotaro Ochida, a pharmacist at an Aum hospital. Ochida, who tried to escape from a sect compound, was held down and strangled by another Aum member who was allegedly told that he too would be killed if he did not strangle Ochida. On 10 October 1995, Aum Shinrikyo was ordered stripped of its official status as a \"religious [[Juridical person|legal entity]]\" and was declared bankrupt in early 1996. However, the group continues to operate under the constitutional guarantee of [[Freedom of religion in Japan|freedom of religion]], funded by a successful computer business and donations, and under strict [[surveillance]]. Attempts to ban the group altogether under the 1952 Subversive Activities Prevention Law were rejected by the Public Security Examination Commission in January 1997.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe group underwent a number of transformations in the aftermath of Asahara's arrest and trial. For a brief time, Asahara's two preteen sons officially replaced him as guru. It re-grouped under the new name \"Aleph\" in February 2000. It announced a change in doctrine: religious texts related to controversial [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist doctrines and the Bible were removed. The group apologized to the victims of the sarin gas attack and established a special compensation fund. Provocative publications and activities that alarmed society are no longer published.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[Fumihiro Joyu]], one of the few senior leaders of the group under Asahara who did not face serious charges, became official head of the organization in 1999.

He chased them for about {{convert|100|yd|m}} before collapsing, dying 10 days later without coming out of a deep coma. Doctors in the hospital suspected at the time he had been poisoned with an [[organophosphate]] pesticide. But the cause of death was pinned down only after cult members arrested for the [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|subway attack in Tokyo]] in March 1995 confessed to the killing. Ethyl methylphosphonate, methylphosphonic acid, and diisopropyl-2-(methylthio) ethylamine were later found in the body of the victim. Unlike the cases for [[sarin]] ([[Matsumoto incident]] and Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway), VX was not used for mass murder.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn February 1995, several cult members kidnapped Kiyoshi Kariya, a 69-year-old brother of a member who had escaped, from a Tokyo street and took him to a compound in [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] near [[Mount Fuji]], where he was killed.

Some estimates claim as many as 6,000 people were injured by the sarin. It is difficult to obtain exact numbers since many victims are reluctant to come forward.<ref>Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum, Philip Gabriel, ''Underground'', Vintage International, 2001.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nProsecutors allege that Asahara was tipped off by an insider about planned police raids on cult facilities and ordered an attack in central Tokyo to divert police attention away from the group.

During the raids, Aum issued statements claiming that the chemicals were for fertilizers. Over the next six weeks, over 150 cult members were arrested for a variety of offenses. The media was stationed outside Aum's Tokyo headquarters on Komazawa Dori in [[Aoyama, Tokyo|Aoyama]] for months after the attack and arrests waiting for action and to get images of the cult's other members. On March 30, 1995, Takaji Kunimatsu, chief of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]], was shot four times near his house in Tokyo and was seriously wounded. While many suspected Aum involvement in the shooting, the ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' reported that [[Hiroshi Nakamura (dissident)|Hiroshi Nakamura]] is suspected of the crime, but nobody has been charged.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 23 April 1995, [[Hideo Murai]], the head of Aum's Ministry of Science, was stabbed to death outside the cult's Tokyo headquarters amidst a crowd of about 100 reporters, in front of cameras. The man responsible, a Korean member of [[Yamaguchi-gumi]], was arrested and eventually convicted of the murder. His motive remains unknown. On the evening of 5 May, a burning paper bag was discovered in a toilet in Tokyo's busy [[Shinjuku station]]. Upon examination it was revealed that it was a [[hydrogen cyanide]] device which, had it not been extinguished in time, would have released enough gas into the ventilation system to potentially kill 10,000 commuters.<ref name=chrono/> On July 4, several undetonated cyanide devices were found at other locations in the Tokyo subway.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/425960/HERES-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-POISON-GAS-ATTACKS-IN-JAPAN.html|title=Here's a chronology of poison gas attacks in Japan|work=[[Deseret News]]| date= July 5, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/07/04/Four-injured-by-Tokyo-station-gas-fumes/1840804830400|title= Four injured by Tokyo station gas fumes|publisher=United Press International|date=4 July 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Jonathan B.|title=Toxic Terror: Assessing Terrorist Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons|date=February 2000|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrPyPP7gkHYC|via=Google Books|accessdate=29 September 2017|isbn=9780262700719}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, numerous cult members were arrested for various offenses, but arrests of the most senior members on the charge of the subway gassing had not yet taken place. In June, an individual unrelated to Aum had launched a copycat attack by hijacking [[All Nippon Airways Flight 857]], a Boeing 747 bound for Hakodate from Tokyo. The hijacker claimed to be an Aum member in possession of sarin and plastic explosives, but these claims were ultimately found to be false.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAsahara was finally found hiding within a wall of a cult building known as \"The 6th Satian\" in the Kamikuishiki complex on 16 May and was arrested.<ref name=chrono/> On the same day, the cult mailed a parcel bomb to the office of [[Yukio Aoshima]], the governor of Tokyo, blowing off the fingers of his secretary's hand. Asahara was initially charged with 23 counts of murder and 16 other offenses. The trial, dubbed \"the trial of the century\" by the press, ruled Asahara guilty of masterminding the attack and [[Capital punishment in Japan|sentenced him to death]]. The indictment was appealed unsuccessfully. A number of senior members accused of participation, such as Masami Tsuchiya, also received death sentences.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe reasons why a small circle of mostly senior Aum members committed atrocities and the extent of personal involvement by Asahara remain unclear, although several theories have attempted to explain these events. In response to the prosecution's charge that Asahara ordered the subway attacks to distract authorities, the defense maintained that Asahara was not aware of events, pointing to his deteriorating health. Shortly after his arrest, Asahara abandoned his post as the organization's leader, and since then has maintained silence, refusing to communicate even with lawyers and family members.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===After 1995===\n[[File:Anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest.JPG|thumb|300px|An anti-Aum Shinrikyo protest in Japan, 2009.]]\nOn 21 June 1995, Asahara acknowledged that in January 1994 he ordered the killing of a sect member, Kotaro Ochida, a pharmacist at an Aum hospital. Ochida, who tried to escape from a sect compound, was held down and strangled by another Aum member who was allegedly told that he too would be killed if he did not strangle Ochida. On 10 October 1995, Aum Shinrikyo was ordered stripped of its official status as a \"religious [[Juridical person|legal entity]]\" and was declared bankrupt in early 1996. However, the group continues to operate under the constitutional guarantee of [[Freedom of religion in Japan|freedom of religion]], funded by a successful computer business and donations, and under strict [[surveillance]]. Attempts to ban the group altogether under the 1952 Subversive Activities Prevention Law were rejected by the Public Security Examination Commission in January 1997.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe group underwent a number of transformations in the aftermath of Asahara's arrest and trial. For a brief time, Asahara's two preteen sons officially replaced him as guru. It re-grouped under the new name \"Aleph\" in February 2000. It announced a change in doctrine: religious texts related to controversial [[Vajrayana]] Buddhist doctrines and the Bible were removed. The group apologized to the victims of the sarin gas attack and established a special compensation fund. Provocative publications and activities that alarmed society are no longer published.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[Fumihiro Joyu]], one of the few senior leaders of the group under Asahara who did not face serious charges, became official head of the organization in 1999. [[K\u014dki Ishii]], a legislator who formed an anti-Aum committee in the [[National Diet]] in 1999, was murdered in 2002.\n\nFor over 15 years, only three fugitives were being actively sought.

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012), which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]''(2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favored the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar is a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012), which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]''(2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favored the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar is a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0\"'''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'''\"\u00a0of the town. '''San Isidro''' was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nDuring the Spanish period and the early part of the American era, Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was a part of a settlement as one municipality known as San Isidro de Potot. Burgos may have been the last place to be found in the settlement but even though it still became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\nIn 1913, as mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz, the name of the town was changed to\u00a0Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from '''San Isidro''' to '''Burgos''' in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, '''Mat\u00edas Guiang''', a powerful sailor from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. He decided to emigrate with his neighbors, family and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the [[Agno River]] by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful. The Dominicans left during the American regime and were succeeded by Filipino clergymen who continued the improvement of the house of God and the ministration of the faithful. The church edifice, made mostly of quarried adobe stones and rough-hewn lumber, was painstakingly built through many years. It is tribute to the Spanish missionaries that the present fa\u00e7ade which they had built a century ago has withstood the elements and ravages of time.\n==Tourist destinations==\nThe town of Burgos may not be famous for many but this town is also a home of some natural wonders like white-sand beaches and falls that will surely be loved by many.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''Cabongaoan White Sand Beach''': Cabongaoan Beach is a pristine beach located in the town of Burgos, Pangasinan. It lies in the coastal barrio of Cabongaoan.\n\n[[File:Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Cabongaoan Beach]]\n*'''Death Pool/Depth Pool (Lagoon)''': Cabongaoan Beach has another feature that makes it a cut above the rest of Pangasinan's beaches: the so-called \"Death Pool.\" This tidal pool on the rocky side of the beach gets filled with water when the waves crash against it. This tidal pool was also featured in the national television show [[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho|''KMJS'']]. As scary as its name may sound, it's perfectly safe to dive in and float around.\n*\n\n[[File:Death Pool, Cabongaoan Beach, Burgos, Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|right|Death Pool]]\n*'''Sangbay Falls''': Located in Barangay San Vicente. The panoramic Sangbay Falls which could be visited best during the ber-months.\n\n[[File:Sangbay Falls.jpg|thumb|right|Sangbay Falls]]\n*'''Rolling Hills''': Other natural attractions in Burgos

This town is located at the edge of the Zambales mountain ranges, West of Mabini, South of Agno, North of Dasol and East of the China Sea. About 65 kilometers away from the capital town of Lingayen.\n\nBurgos was founded as an independent town in 1830 by the early Ilocanos from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] headed by Don Matias Guiang. The provincial government of [[Zambales]] has not ignored the ever increasing population and as it saw the necessity of a government to oversee the village. Don Matias Guiang made history, as quoted from the Philippine Archives, when on May 15, 1830 the Spanish Governor of [[Zambales]] issued a decree creating his settlement into a \"pueblo\" and appointed him as the first [[gobernadorcillo]] and was first named San Isidro in honor of its Patron Saint. Since there was another locality named San Isidro along the Lingayen Gulf, the residents later decided to add \"Potot\" derived from the description of the Amburayan River which appeared to be cut or \"potot\". Confusion however continued and persisted as mails for San Isidro de Potot were missent to the town of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]] and those of the latter to the former town to finally solved the confusion and was finally renamed Burgos, after the Filipino Martyr priest who was executed during the Spanish regime. The renaming of the town was done in 1913 during the administration of Don Anacleto Ruiz.\n\nThe town of Burgos was ceded to the Province of Pangasinan, by virtue of Republic Act No. 1004 dated November 30, 1903 of the Philippine Commission. There also holds the westernmost point in Luzon.<br />\n[[File:Burgos, Pangasinan Welcome Sign.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome signage]]\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0797 24.JPG|thumb|right|Burgos Town Hall]]\n\n==Etymology==    \n\nBurgos, so-called today, this being the present official name, was known before as\u00a0San Isidro\u00a0during the Spanish time and was then within the geographical jurisdiction of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\nHow this place got its name is not definitely known. Judging from the fact that there were no accounts left circulating in the lips of the old people today as to how is got its name. \n\nThe early immigrants were God-fearing people. The have come to this place, lured by its vast agri-cultural possibilities. They were charmed by the rolling hills and the nice valleys cut-ting the plain. They envisioned that this is an ideal place that would give them ease, peace and comfort in their later life. When the early settlers migrated, to this place, they brought with them their religious beliefs. They worshipped fervently, revered highly [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]\u00a0and pinned their fates and hopes of bountiful harvest upon the blessings of the Saint.\n\nAfter some years the settlers have increased their tribe and number and then came necessity of organizing their settlement into a public with Don Matias Guiang, who was then the most prosperous land owner of the place and the most influential personage to the settler, as the first\u00a0\"'''[[Gobernadorcillo]]'''\"\u00a0of the town. '''San Isidro''' was its incorporated name in honor of\u00a0St. Isidore the Laborer, whom the settlers have adopted, loved and revered as their Patron Saint. \n\nDuring the Spanish period and the early part of the American era, Burgos, Dasol and Mabini was a part of a settlement as one municipality known as San Isidro de Potot. Burgos may have been the last place to be found in the settlement but even though it still became the settlement's capital due to its fast-growing economy that it was declared an independent town upon its founding. The term \"'''Potot'''\" appended to the name San Isidro in an Ilocano adjective meaning \"'''clipped'''\", \"'''cut-off'''\" or disconnected. Not far from poblacion there is a brook or stream which during dry common ages has not continuous water. This stream, therefore, is discontinued and disconnected during summer months and to those now-comers in the place, this condition of the stream served as identification of the location of the town.\n\nThere were being then two municipalities in Pangasinan with the name of San Isidro Labrador and Potot, But the term \"'''Potot'''\" identified it well more from the other.\n\n===Folktale===\n\nThe Locals unveils the tale of how the town may have got its first name.\n\nLong ago when there were only few people living in the area where now the town of Burgos located, there were hunters who were hunting for wild animals. When these hunters got tired and thirsty, they looked for water to drink. As they were walking, they saw a man with a beard carrying a long cane. The hunters inquired from the man where they may be able to get water. The man drove his cane through the ground and suddenly water came flowing. Much to their surprise, the hunters remained silent for a moment. The man carrying a long cane was believed to be the patron saint, of the town, [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore the Laborer]]. From that time up to the present we can still see the spring with its made wall, which is also the source of water supply of some folks of the town.\n\n===Renaming===\nIn 1913, as mayor, Don Anacleto Ruiz, the name of the town was changed to\u00a0Burgos, in memory of one of the greatest Filipino martyrs, Padre [[Jos\u00e9 Burgos|Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos]], who together with Padre Gomez and Zamora were mercilessly executed in the field of Bagumbayan on February 17, 1872. Padre Burgos, a very influential and able man was an [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], he being a native of [[Vigan|Vigan, Ilocos Sur]]. He was highly praised in the real of priesthood and was very much loved by his people but more so by the Ilocanos. Before his death, he was a great reformer, his execution was deeply resented and mourned for the people believed in his innocence. To perpetuate his memory, the authorities changed the name of this town from '''San Isidro''' to '''Burgos''' in a grateful remembrance of this overwhelming love and admiration of the people for priesthood, as a profession.\n\n==History==\nIn the first part of the 19th century, '''Mat\u00edas Guiang''', a powerful sailor from [[Paoay|Paoay, Ilocos Norte]] regularly traveled the China Sea between the [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] and [[Zambales]] region for commercial purposes. He decided to emigrate with his neighbors, family and friends to Zambales del Norte, now the western part of the province of Pangasinan. They disembarked at the mouth of the [[Agno River]] by tracing it.\n\n===Philippine Revolution===\nIn the late 19th century in San Isidro de Potot, [[Zambales]] (now,'''\u00a0Burgos''', '''Pangasinan'''). The municipal Gobernadorcillo was Don Tomas Braga, and the parish priest of the town before the revolution was a native of\u00a0[[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]], and his name was Mariano Torrente.\n\nThe town was a prosperous community of farming and ranching. But the atmosphere was already seething with dissidence; winds of rebellion disturb the people.\n\nTwenty Spanish \"'''Cazadores'''\" had their cuartel or barracks in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. Cazadores literally means \"'''hunters'''\" their aim was to hunt the Filipino outlaws or dissidents.\n\nAcross the plaza from the cuartel was the big convent which stood at the same place where now stands the small convent. This convent was made out of adobe stones, 24 meters long and 12 meters wide; It was two stories high.\n\nAcross the plaza from the convent was the \"'''tribunal'''\" or municipal hall where now stands the present municipal hall building. This tribunal was made out of adobe stones. It was ten meters high.\n\nA tower was being constructed at the town plaza between the convent and the tribunal. This tower or fort was made of stones, 5 meters square inside dimensions, 3 stories high, and its walls are 1/2 meter thick.\n\nInsurgency was becoming widespread; the measures adopted by the Spaniards increased the number of outlaws. In Northern Zambales, which is now Western, Pangasinan, the soprano of the surgent was Ramon Manalang whose headquarters was in a hideout somewhere in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''').\n\nIn San Isidro (now '''Burgos'''), the captain of the outlaws was Juanso Viado. The outlaws or dissidents were very numerous, had very few defective guns, and mostly armed with crude sabers, sharp spears and long bolos.\n\nIt was in February 1898. The outlaws attacked the cuartel of the Cazadores in the big house of Don Gaspar Ruiz. The attackers greatly outnumbered the Cazadores. The Cazadores, armed with mauzzers, were poor shooters; while the Filipino outlaws, currently armed, were nomatoli for the well-armed Cazadores.\n\nThe twenty Spanish Cazadores managed to escape to the convent across the plaza. The Filipino attackers laid a siege to them.\n\nOne day, about mealtime, when the Filipino besiegers slackened their vigilance, the Cazadores were able to escape to the tower at the middle of the plaza. Already the cuartel was occupied by the outlaws.\n\nFor two nights and three days, the Cazadores stayed in the tower or fort without food. The people of the town including the municipal gobernadorcillo gone to distant the place.\n\nBut Padre Mariano Torrente reminded, being a peaceful man, and maintaining maturity in the fight, he acted as the lissome between the Spanish Cazadores and the Filipino outlaws.\n\nCaptain Juanso Viado of the outlaws told Padre Mariano Torrente that the cazadores should better surrender, or they would die of hunger. The priest was able to prevail upon the Spaniards to low down their arms.\n\nOn the third afternoon, the Spanish Cazadores threw their guns out of the windows of the tower in token of surrender. The Filipino outlaws took the guns, then the Cazadores went out of the tower, and the Filipino outlaws and Spanish Cazadores shook hands and embraced each other as good friends.\n\nBut such good friendship was short-lived. A fatal coincidence happened which turned the friendship into tragedy.\n\nThe morning following the surrender, news reached San Isidro that a big Spanish troop heavily armed arrived in Alaminos, Zambales (now '''[[Pangasinan]]''') on their way to San Isidro. This news alarmed the outlaws who reacted immediately seizing the Cazadores and taking them as prisoners. For the gladdened Cazadores naturally; the Spanish troop was being sent to save all Spaniards.\n\nThe Spanish Cazadores including Padre Mariano Torrente and also Padre Juan Naves of Dasol, were taken to the forest of Alimpayukan between San Isidro and Balincaguin (now'''\u00a0[[Mabini, Pangasinan]]'''). The Spaniards, upon being assured of their safety, and that no harm would happen, went willingly.\n\nUpon arriving at the forest, Alimpayukan, 20 Spanish Cazadores and 2 Spanish priests were blindfolded and their heads out-off. For the Spanish troop is about to arrive, and the Spaniards might escape to join them.\n\nShortly after the Spaniards were murdered, the big Spanish troop arrived in San Isidro and encircled the town. There were 20 uniformed Filipino outlaws or insurgents who were to form a local government. These were caught, taken to Mt. Polipol just a few kilometers east from the town, and were shot in a single file.\n\nAt that time, there was known as \"'''Juez de Cuchillo'''\", which means that if a priest was murdered in a town, the said town, being listed to\u00a0Juez de Cuchillo,\u00a0shall have its people killed and even their houses destroyed.\n\nIn San Isidro, no people could be seen for they had evacuated, and only the twenty Filipino insurgents were seen and caught and killed. The Spanish troop burned down the big houses that are owned by the richest and the most influential personage of the town.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left San Isidro, and then proceeded to [[Dasol]], in this place they killed the \"[[Principal\u00eda|'''principal\u00edas''']]\" and \"'''captains'''\", that is, the rich and the influential, and also burned their big houses. Because the Spanish priest of Dasol, Padre Juan Naves was beheaded in the forest of Alimpayukan; and many of the insurgents were from Dasol for the body of outlaws, headed by captain Juanso Viado, came from many places.\n\nThe big Spanish troop left [[Dasol]] empty-handed, a lot of people were killed including the rich and influential, so was their big houses were also burned down and left into ashes.\n\nThe Spanish detachments in the northern towns of Zambales was defeated and around 50 Spanish Friars were annihilated. These were the parish priests of [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]], [[Dasol]] and San Isidro de Potot.\n\nNothing more was heard of the Spanish troop. Perhaps they were secured or perhaps imprisoned by the outlaws.\n\n===American Occupation===\nThe Katipunan Government was functioning smoothly, at least in San Isidro. In November 1900, Gen. Miguel and Don Miguel and Don Mauro Ortis came to recruit volunteers to meet the Americans in\u00a0[[Mangatarem]]. The volunteers went to Mangatarem, but poorly armed, had to retreat before the heavy American arms and cobranded. Nicolas Guiang, who was among those recruited, back across the mountains to Mt. Pita, then went to Infanta, and then back to San Isidro.\n\nThe Americans moved swiftly. They occupied San Isidro by December 1900 and established peace and order. They came with their wives. The costumes of the American women had decided influences in changing the Filipino costumes from oriental to occidental.\n\nThe Americans established a policy of attraction and launched it literally. They gave clothes, freely goods and tolerated the local customs.\n\nIn 1901 a severe storm hit San Isidro. The big convent was wrecked. So was the municipal building. The town church managed to survive and some of the original structures of the church still stands in some years, but It faced several renovations through the years due to avoid collapsing possibilities.\n\nIn 1903, the northern part of Zambales was annexed to the Province of Pangasinan. The municipalities ceded were [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]], [[Bani, Pangasinan|Bani]],\u00a0[[Agno, Pangasinan|Agno]], [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] and San Isidro de Potot (Burgos, [[Dasol]], and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]]). Townsfolk cited alleged lack of concern for the town's interest and welfare by the Zambales provincial government therefore they were incorporated to Pangasinan.\n\nShortly after, the towns of Northern Zambales were incorporated in Pangasinan. [[Dasol]] and [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Balincaguin]] seceded from San Isidro de Potot,  Balincaguin was renamed as Mabini (in honor of\u00a0'''[[Apolinario Mabini]]'''). San Isidro de Potot was changed to Burgos (in honor of Padre '''[[Jos\u00e9 Burgos]]'''), and in order not to confuse it to\u00a0[[Labrador, Pangasinan|San Isidro Labrador de Tobuang]] of Pangasinan.\n\n==List of Municipal Heads==\n\nThe name of persons who held a leading official position during the Spanish period and thereafter were the following.\n\n\n[[Gobernadorcillo]]:\n\n*Don Matias Guiang (1830)\n*\n\n*Don Pascual Bonostro (1831)\n*\n\n*Don Diego Bustamante (1832)\n*\n*Don Fernando Bonilla (1833)\n*\n*Don Paulo Padua (1834)\n*\n*Don Matias Guiang (1835)\n*\n*Don Juan Discoloso (1836)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonostro (1837)\n*\n*Don Agustin Cuaresma (1838)\n*\n*Don Pascual de Guzman (1839)\n*\n*Don Paulo Doctor (1840)\n*\n*Don Pedro Guiang (1841)\n*\n*Don Vicente Bondal (1842)\n*\n*Don Miguel Cuaresma (1843)\n*\n*Don Ramon Bustria (1844)\n*\n*Don Exequel Ugto (1845)\n*\n*Don Agapito Tolentino Braga (1846)\n*\n*Don Domingo Valdez (1847)\n*\n*Don Tomas Guiang (1848)\n*\n*Don Jose de Leon (1849)\n*\n*Don Juan Bonilla (1850)\n*\n*Don Henenio Doctor (1851)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Bonostro (1852)\n*\n*Don Romualdo Braga (1853)\n*\n*Don Melchor Ruiz (1854)\n*\n*Don Paulino Bustamante (1855)\n*\n*Don Feliciano de Guzman (1856)\n*\n*Don Eldefonzo Bona (1857)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Valdez (1858)\n*\n*Don Agapito Ugto (1859)\n*\n*Don Martin Gallardo (1860)\n*\n*Don Mariano Mendoza (1861)\n*\n*Don Anborcio Guiang (1862)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1863)\n*\n*Don Santiago Ruiz (1864)\n*\n*Don Justo Bonada (1865)\n*\n*Don Victorio Braga (1867)\n*\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1869)\n*\n*Don Silvestro Ruiz (1871)\n*\n*Don Cornelio Braga (1873)\n*\n*Don Flaviano Cudal (1875)\n*\n*Don Francisco Guiang (1877)\n*\n*Don Lorenzo Bonando (1879)\n*\n*Don Raymundo Boricano (1881)\n*\n*Don Simon Ruiz (1883)\n*\n*Don Simon Guiang (1885)\n*\n*Don Vinancio Gallardo (1887)\n*\n*Don Pablo Boricano (1889)\n*\n*Don Lauriano Kadarang (1891)\n*\n*Don Luiz Bonilla (1893)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1895)\n\n===President during the Revolution===\n\n*Don Mauricio Gallardo (1898\u20131900)\n*\n*Don Tomas Braga (1900\u20131901)\n*\n*Don Carlos Ruiz (1901\u20131902) \n\n\n===Municipal President during the civil government===\n\n*Don Paulino Mendoza (1904\u20131905)\n*\n*Don Francisco Bustamante (1906\u20131907)\n*\n*Don Jacinto Braga (1908\u20131911)\n*\n*Don Nicolas Guiang (1911\u20131912)\n*\n*Don Anacleto Ruiz (1912\u20131916)\n*\n*Don Juan Eonado (1916\u20131919)\n*\n*Don Matias Ruiz (1919\u20131922)\n*\n*Don Agustin R.

During the Spanish rule this municipality was part of the province of [[Zambales]].\n\n*Saint Isidore The Farmer Parish Church\n*\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 01.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIn 1876, the Dominicans created the Parish church of St. Isidore, the patron saint of farmers, seeing that the town\u2019s chief industry was farming. The inhabitants, who were already steeped in Christian ways and they longed for a church where they can worship God. They realized their wish when the Spanish missionaries came and founded the Parish of St. Isidore the Farmer in the year 1876. The patron\u2019s feast is annually celebrated on May 15. It is also the town fiesta.\n[[File:Burgos,Pangasinanjf0737 23.JPG|thumb|right|]]\nIt was the founding missionaries who built the present fa\u00e7ade of the church, made mostly of quarried adobe stones contributed by the faithful.

Declines in habitat-specialist and disturbance-sensitive bird species and in large-frugivorous mammals were also observed in Amazonian burned forests, while temporary extirpation of more than 100 lowland butterfly species occurred at a burned forest site in Borneo. \n\nMost critically, global mass bleaching events were recorded in 1997-98 and 2015\u201316, when around 75-99% losses of live coral were registered across the word. Considerable attention was also given to the collapse of Peruvian and Chilean anchovy populations that leaded to a severe fishery crisis following the ENSO events in 1972\u201373, 1982\u201383, 1997-98 and, more recently, in 2015\u201316. In particular, increased surface seawater temperatures in 1982-83 also lead to the probable extinction of two hydrocoral species in Panam\u00e1, and to a massive mortality of kelp beds along 600 km of coastline in Chile, from which kelps and associated biodiversity slowly recovered in the most affected areas even after 20 years.

''The Beautiful Music all Around Us: Field Recordings and the American Experience''. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2012. p. 93.</ref> [[James Whitcomb Riley]] published a poem building on older lyrics in 1900.  A \"collected\" version was published by E. C. Perrow in 1915. It is song number 4209 in the [[Roud Folk Song Index]].  \n\nShortening bread refers to a bread, made of corn meal and/or flour and [[lard]] [[shortening]]. It should not be confused with [[shortbread]].\n\n==Origins==\n\"Shortnin' Bread\" is a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] song. Its first written version was captured by poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] in 1900. He titled the song \"A Short'nin' Bread Song\u2014Pieced Out\", and wrote the first verse as:\n\n{{poemquote|Fotch dat dough fum the kitchin-shed\nRake de coals out hot an' red\nPutt on de oven an' putt on de led\nMammy's gwiner cook som short'nin' bread<ref>Eitel, ''The Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley'', p. 119.</ref>}}\n\nThe dialect rendered into common English would be:\n\n{{poemquote|Fetch that dough, from the kitchen shed\nRake those coals out, hot and red\nPut on the oven and put on the lid\nMommy's going to cook some short'nin' bread}}\n\nThe verse includes:\n{{poemquote|When corn plantin' done come roun'\nBlackbird own de whole plowed groun'\nCorn is de grain as I've hearn said\nDat's de blackbird's short'nin' bread}}\n\nAnother pair of verses may be later, and exist in several versions:\n\n{{poemquote|Three little children, lying in bed\nTwo was sick and the other 'most dead\nSend for the doctor and the doctor said\n\"feed them children on short'nin' bread\"}}\n\n{{poemquote|When those children, sick in bed,\nheard that talk 'bout short'nin' bread.\nThey popped up well, to dance and sing,\nskipping around and cut the pigeon wing.}}\n\n(In some versions there are two children instead of three - and the \"other\" either \"bump'd his head\". or \"was dead\". Neither of these quite scan, and seem unlikely to have been the original. The children (or \"chillun\") were once referred to by one of several racist terms. \n\nOther verses include:\n{{poemquote|Pull out the skillet, pull out the led,\nMama's gonna make a little short'nin' bread\nThat ain't all she's gonna do,\nMama's gonna make a little coffee too}}\n\n{{poemquote|I slipped to the kitchen, slipped on the led,\nslipped my pockets full of short'nin' bread.\nI stole the skillet, I stole the led,\nI stole the girl who makes short'nin' bread}}\n\n{{poemquote|They caught me with the skillet, They caught me with the led,\nThey caught me with the girl who makes short'nin' bread.\nI paid six dollars for the skillet, six dollars for the led,\nSpent six months in jail eating short'nin' bread.}}\n\n==Folk version==\nTitled \"Shortened Bread\", E. C. Perrow published the first folk version of this song in 1915, which he collected from East Tennessee in 1912.<ref>Perrow, [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-534506/534506#page/n14/mode/1up \"Songs and Rhymes from the South,\" p. 142]: \"from Tennessee mountain whites, 1912\".</ref> The folk version of the song\u2014as with Riley's\u2014does not have any distinct theme, but consists of various floating lyrics, some relating to \"shortnin' bread\", some not. The traditional chorus associated with the folk song goes:\n{{poemquote|Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin'\nMammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread\nMammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin'\nMammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread}}\n\n==The Beach Boys version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Shortenin' Bread\n| cover    =\n| alt      =\n| type     =\n| artist   = [[The Beach Boys]]\n| album    = [[L.A.

''The Beautiful Music all Around Us: Field Recordings and the American Experience''. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2012. p. 93.</ref> [[James Whitcomb Riley]] published a poem building on older lyrics in 1900.  A \"collected\" version was published by E. C. Perrow in 1915. It is song number 4209 in the [[Roud Folk Song Index]].  \n\nShortening bread refers to a bread, made of corn meal and/or flour and [[lard]] [[shortening]]. It should not be confused with [[shortbread]].\n\n==Origins==\n\"Shortnin' Bread\" is a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] song. Its first written version was captured by poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] in 1900. He titled the song \"A Short'nin' Bread Song\u2014Pieced Out\", and wrote the first verse as:\n\n{{poemquote|Fotch dat dough fum the kitchin-shed\nRake de coals out hot an' red\nPutt on de oven an' putt on de led\nMammy's gwiner cook som short'nin' bread<ref>Eitel, ''The Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley'', p. 119.</ref>}}\n\nThe dialect rendered into common English would be:\n\n{{poemquote|Fetch that dough, from the kitchen shed\nRake those coals out, hot and red\nPut on the oven and put on the lid\nMommy's going to cook some short'nin' bread}}\n\nThe verse includes:\n{{poemquote|When corn plantin' done come roun'\nBlackbird own de whole plowed groun'\nCorn is de grain as I've hearn said\nDat's de blackbird's short'nin' bread}}\n\nAnother pair of verses may be later, and exist in several versions:\n\n{{poemquote|Three little children, lying in bed\nTwo was sick and the other 'most dead\nSend for the doctor and the doctor said\n\"feed them children on short'nin' bread\"}}\n\n{{poemquote|When those children, sick in bed,\nheard that talk 'bout short'nin' bread.\nThey popped up well, to dance and sing,\nskipping around and cut the pigeon wing.}}\n\n(In some versions there are two children instead of three - and the \"other\" either \"bump'd his head\". or \"was dead\". Neither of these quite scan, and seem unlikely to have been the original. The children (or \"chillun\") were once referred to by one of several racist terms. \n\nOther verses include:\n{{poemquote|Pull out the skillet, pull out the led,\nMama's gonna make a little short'nin' bread\nThat ain't all she's gonna do,\nMama's gonna make a little coffee too}}\n\n{{poemquote|I slipped to the kitchen, slipped on the led,\nslipped my pockets full of short'nin' bread.\nI stole the skillet, I stole the led,\nI stole the girl who makes short'nin' bread}}\n\n{{poemquote|They caught me with the skillet, They caught me with the led,\nThey caught me with the girl who makes short'nin' bread.\nI paid six dollars for the skillet, six dollars for the led,\nSpent six months in jail eating short'nin' bread.}}\n\n==Folk version==\nTitled \"Shortened Bread\", E. C. Perrow published the first folk version of this song in 1915, which he collected from East Tennessee in 1912.<ref>Perrow, [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-534506/534506#page/n14/mode/1up \"Songs and Rhymes from the South,\" p. 142]: \"from Tennessee mountain whites, 1912\".</ref> The folk version of the song\u2014as with Riley's\u2014does not have any distinct theme, but consists of various floating lyrics, some relating to \"shortnin' bread\", some not. The traditional chorus associated with the folk song goes:\n{{poemquote|Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin'\nMammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread\nMammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin'\nMammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread}}\n\n==The Beach Boys version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name     = Shortenin' Bread\n| cover    =\n| alt      =\n| type     =\n| artist   = [[The Beach Boys]]\n| album    = [[L.A.

After McGuinn spent some time crafting \"Ding Dang\" with Wilson, he went to bed. The next day, he awoke to Wilson, still awake, and still playing \"Ding Dang\" on piano.
