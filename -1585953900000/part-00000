He subsequently traveled to the United States to earn a master's degree in [[food science]] and international [[nutrition]] at [[Cornell University]] in 1978. After a brief stint in government working in Colombia's Department of National Planning, in [[Bogota]], from 1981 to 1982,<ref name=person>{{cite web|title=People: Arturo Escobar|url=http://anthropology.unc.edu/person/arturo-escobar/|website=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Anthropology|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> in 1987 he received an interdisciplinary Ph.D from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in Development Philosophy, Policy and Planning.<ref name=person/>\n\nHe has taught mainly at [[U.S. universities]], including the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], but also abroad at institutions in Colombia, [[Finland]], [[Spain]], and England. He is currently a professor of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he teaches courses in development theory and social change, often co-teaching with long-time mentee Dr. Michal Osterweil of UNC's Department of Global Studies.\n\n==Scholarship==\n\n=== Anthropological approach ===\nEscobar's approach to anthropology is largely informed by the [[poststructuralist]] and [[postcolonialist]] traditions and centered around two recent developments: [[subaltern studies]] and the idea of a [[World Anthropologies Network]] (WAN).  His research interests are related to [[political ecology]]; the [[development anthropology|anthropology of development]], social movements; [[Latin American]] development and politics. Escobar's research uses critical techniques in his provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general. He also explores possibilities for alternative visions for a [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] era.\n\nHe is a major figure in the post-development academic discourse, and a serious critic of development practices championed by western industrialized societies. According to Escobar, the problem with the development is that it is external, based on the model of the industrialized world, and what is needed instead are more \"[[endogenous]] discourses\".(Pieterse, 2010)\n\n===Criticism of development===\nEscobar's contends in his 1995 book ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'' that [[international development]] became a mechanism of control comparable to [[colonialism]] or \"[[cultural imperialism]] that poor countries had little means of declining politely\".<ref name=guard/> The book, which won the 1996 Best Book Prize of the New England Council of Latin American Studies,<ref name=umass>{{cite news|title=UMass Amherst Anthropology Professor Arturo Escobar Wins Guggenheim Fellowship|url=http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-anthropology-professor-arturo-escobar-wins-guggenheim-fellowship|work=[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] News & Media Relations|date=23 April 1997}}</ref> traced the rise and fall of development through [[Michel Foucault]]'s [[discourse analysis]], which regards development as [[ontological]]ly cultural (i.e., by examining linguistic structure and meaning). This led him to conclude that \"development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live\".<ref name=guard/> Citing Foucault marked a shift in the study of development from realism to interpretivist or [[post-structuralist]] approaches, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned, giving rise to a coordinated and coherent set of interventions that Escobar calls the \"development apparatus\".\n\nEscobar theorizes that the development era was produced by a discursive construction contained in [[Harry S. Truman]]'s official representation of his administration's foreign policy. By referring to the three continents of South America, Africa, and Asia as \"underdeveloped\" and in need of significant change to achieve progress, Truman set in motion a reorganization of bureaucracy around thinking and acting to systematically change the \"[[third world]]\". In addition, he argues that Truman's discursive construction was infused with the imperatives of American [[social reproduction]] and [[American imperialism|imperial pretensions]]. As a result, the development apparatus functioned to support the consolidation of [[American hegemony]].\n\nEscobar encourages scholars to use [[ethnographic]] methods to further the post-development era by advancing the deconstructive creations initiated by contemporary social movements (without claiming universal applicability). Indeed, the Colombia case study in ''Encountering Development'' demonstrates that development economists' \"economization of food\" resulted in ambitious plans but not necessarily less hunger. A new 2011 edition of the book begins with a substantial new introduction, in which he argues that \"postdevelopment\" needs to be redefined and that a field of \"pluriversal studies\" would be helpful.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'', Arturo Escobar (with a new preface by the author)|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9564.html|website=[[Princeton University Press]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Political ecology===\nEscobar received a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in 1997 to study \"Cultural and Biological Diversity in the Late Twentieth Century\".<ref name=umass/> This project culminated in the publication of his latest book, ''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' by [[Duke University Press]] in 2008, which \"analyzes the politics of difference enacted by specific place-based ethnic and environmental movements in the context of [[Neoliberalism#Globalization|neoliberal globalization]]\".<ref name=amazon>{{cite web|title=''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' (New Ecologies for the Twenty-First Century)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Territories-Difference-Movements-Ecologies-Twenty-First/dp/0822343274|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> It was written after years of [[fieldwork]] in Colombia with a group of [[Afro-Colombian]] activists of [[Pacific/Choc\u00f3 natural region|Colombia\u2019s Pacific rainforest region]] called the ''Proceso de Comunidades Negras'' (PCN).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Claudia|title=Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes (review)|journal=The Americas|date=April 2011|volume=67|issue=4|pages=573\u2013574.|doi=10.1353/tam.2011.0062}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*2018.

Kellogg]] and [[Chester W. Rice]].  The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a [[dynamic microphone]], but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical [[audio signal]] is applied to its [[voice coil]], a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a [[permanent magnet]], the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to [[Faraday's law of induction]], which causes a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create [[sound wave]]s. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an [[audio power amplifier]] before the signal is sent to the speaker.  \n\nSpeakers are typically housed in a [[speaker enclosure]] or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular  square box made of several forms of wood, or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design play an important role in the quality of the sound. The enclosure generally must be as stiff and non-resonant as practically possible. Where [[high fidelity]] reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range ''(picture at right)''.  In this case the individual speakers are referred to as \"drivers\" and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker.  Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called [[tweeter]]s, those for middle frequencies are called [[mid-range speaker|mid-range]] drivers, and those for low frequencies are called [[woofer]]s. Extremely low frequencies (16Hz-~100Hz) may be reproduced by detached [[subwoofer]]s. Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as [[Radio receiver|radios]], [[television]]s, portable audio players, [[computer]]s, and [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] in theatres and concert halls, and in [[public address system]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"loudspeaker\" may refer to individual transducers (also known as \"drivers\") or to complete speaker systems consisting of an [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]] including one or more drivers.\n \nTo adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher [[sound pressure level]] or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named [[subwoofer]]s (for very low frequencies); [[woofer]]s (low frequencies); [[mid-range speaker]]s (middle frequencies); [[tweeter]]s (high frequencies); and sometimes [[supertweeters]], optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds is divided between the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation \"tweeter\" for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as \"HF\" or \"highs\". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a \"filter network\", called a [[Audio crossover|crossover]], separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with ''n'' separate frequency bands is described as \"''n''-way speakers\": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker drivers of the type pictured are termed  \"dynamic\" (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., [[moving iron speaker]]), or speakers using [[Piezoelectric speakers#Piezo tweeter|piezoelectric]] or [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] systems, or any of several other sorts.\n\n==History==\n[[Johann Philipp Reis]] installed an electric loudspeaker in his ''[[telephone]]'' in 1861; it was capable of reproducing clear tones, but also could reproduce muffled [[speech]] after a few revisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis|title=The Forgotten Johann Philipp Reis|last=|first=|date=|website=Integrated Network Cables|accessdate=2015-06-11|df=}}</ref> [[Alexander Graham Bell]] patented his first electric loudspeaker (capable of reproducing intelligible speech) as part of his telephone in 1876, which was followed in 1877 by an improved version from [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Siemens]]. During this time, [[Thomas Edison]] was issued a British patent for a system using compressed air as an amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs, but he ultimately settled for the familiar metal horn driven by a membrane attached to the stylus. In 1898, Horace Short patented a design for a loudspeaker driven by compressed air; he then sold the rights to [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], who was issued several additional British patents before 1910. A few companies, including the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and [[Path\u00e9]], produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers. However, these designs were significantly limited by their poor sound quality and their inability to reproduce sound at low volume. Variants of the system were used for [[public address]] applications, and more recently, other variations have been used to test space-equipment resistance to the very loud sound and vibration levels that the launching of rockets produces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/auxetophone/auxetoph.htm |title=The Auxetophone & Other Compressed-Air Gramophones |accessdate=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n=== Moving-coil ===\nThe first experimental moving-coil (also called ''dynamic'') loudspeaker was invented by [[Oliver Lodge]] in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aes-media.org/historical/html/recording.technology.history/loudspeaker.html |title=Loudspeaker History |accessdate=2019-01-20}}</ref> The first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by Danish engineer [[Peter L.

The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a [[inductor|choke coil]], filtering the [[power supply]] of the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]] that the loudspeaker was connected to.<ref>Henry B.

However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 [[Peter L.

This allowed for better bass response than previously from drivers mounted in smaller cabinets which was important during the transition to stereo recording and reproduction.  He and his partner [[Henry Kloss]] formed the [[Acoustic Research]] company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle.  Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}<!--citation also needed in [[Acoustic suspension]]--> The most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent [[magnet]] materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis.

A protective cap glued in the cone's center prevents dust, especially iron filings, from entering the gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the [[voice coil]], a [[magnetic field]] is created by the electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound under the control of the applied electrical signal coming from the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.\n\n=== Diaphragm ===\nThe diaphragm is usually manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A variety of different materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well [[Absorption (acoustics)|damped]], to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped with little or no audible ringing due to its [[resonance]] frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves [[trade-off]]s. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some [[carbon fiber]], [[Kevlar]], [[Glass (fiber)|glass]], [[hemp]] or [[bamboo]] fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.\n\n=== Basket ===\nThe chassis, frame, or basket, is designed to be rigid, preventing deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps allowing the voice coil to rub against the magnet around the gap. Chassis are typically [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from aluminum alloy, in heavier magnet-structure speakers; or [[machine press|stamped]] from thin sheet steel in lighter-structure drivers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound and recording|date=2009|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-240-52163-3|page=81|edition=6th}}</ref> Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers.   Metallic chassis can play an important role in conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, broils the varnish on the voice coil; it may even demagnetize permanent magnets.\n\nThe suspension system keeps the coil centered in the gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving. A typical suspension system consists of two parts: the ''spider'', which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the lower frame and provides the majority of the restoring force, and the ''surround'', which helps center the coil/cone assembly and allows free pistonic motion aligned with the magnetic gap. The spider is usually made of a [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin. The name comes from the shape of early suspensions, which were two concentric rings of [[Bakelite]] material, joined by six or eight curved \"legs.\" Variations of this topology included the addition of a felt disc to provide a barrier to particles that might otherwise cause the voice coil to rub. The German firm Rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made of wood.\n\n=== Cone materials ===\nThe cone surround can be [[rubber]] or polyester [[foam]], or a ring of concentrically corrugated, resin coated fabric; it is attached to both the outer cone circumference and to the upper frame. These diverse surround materials, their shape and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of a driver; each implementation has advantages and disadvantages. Polyester foam, for example, is lightweight and economical, though usually leaks air to some degree, but is degraded by time, exposure to ozone, UV light, humidity and elevated temperatures, limiting useful life before failure. Treated paper surrounds will eventually fail.\nNeoprene rubber and resin-coated fabric surrounds are longer-lasting. \nThe wire in a voice coil is usually made of [[copper]], though [[aluminum]]\u2014and, rarely, [[silver]]\u2014may be used.  The advantage of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper.  This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency.  A disadvantage of aluminum is that it is not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed.  These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration.  Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside ring of the gap is one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) is the other. The pole piece and backplate are often made as a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.\n\nModern driver magnets are almost always permanent and made of [[ceramic]], [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], [[alnico]], or, more recently, [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth]] such as [[neodymium]] and [[Samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium cobalt]]. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s;  there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design \u2014 due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) \u2014 is the use of the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce [[field coil loudspeaker|electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils]], as was common in the earliest designs;  one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by \"recharging\" the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.\n\nAfter 1980, most (but not quite all) driver manufacturers switched from alnico to ferrite magnets, which are made from a mix of ceramic clay and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite. Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than alnico, it is substantially less expensive, allowing designers to use larger yet more economical magnets to achieve a given performance.\n\nThe size and type of magnet and details of the magnetic circuit differ, depending on design goals. For instance, the shape of the pole piece affects the magnetic interaction between the voice coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify a driver's behavior. A \"shorting ring\", or [[Faraday loop]], may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.\n\nDriver design\u2014including the particular way two or more drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system\u2014is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of [[timbre]] and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Don |author2=Carolyn Davis |title=Sound System Engineering |publisher=Focal Press |year=1997 |edition=2 |page=350 |chapter=Loudspeakers and Loudspeaker Arrays |isbn=978-0-240-80305-0 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouyzH6vsIIwC&pg=PA350 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |language= |quote=We often give lip service to the fact that audio allows its practitioners to engage in both art and science.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fremer |first=Michael |date=April 2004 |title=Aerial Model 20T loudspeaker |journal=Stereophile |url=http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/404aerial/# |accessdate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/arts/home-entertainment-speaker-design-goes-modern.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Speaker Design Goes Modern |last=Fantel |first=Hans |date=June 6, 1993 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> Adjusting a design to improve performance is done using a combination of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an [[anechoic chamber]] to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.\n\nFabrication of finished loudspeaker systems has become segmented, depending largely on price, shipping costs, and weight limitations. High-end speaker systems, which are typically heavier (and often larger) than economic shipping allows outside local regions, are usually made in their target market region and can cost $140,000 or more per pair.<ref>[http://www.nolaspeakers.com/reviews/tas/EditorsChoice2007.html The Absolute Sound, issue 175, October 2007. hp's Workshop: HP's Editor's Choice Awards.

Each of the four drivers outputs a different frequency range; the fifth aperture at the bottom is a [[bass reflex]] port.]]\n\nIndividual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g., subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three most commonly used sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn type drivers.\n\n====Full-range drivers====\n{{Main article|Full-range speaker}}\nA full-range driver is a speaker designed to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel without the help of other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically {{convert|3|to|8|in|cm}} in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some [[computer speaker]]s, etc. In [[hi-fi]] speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures\u2014such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns\u2014to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low-cost quarter-wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|title=Kvart & B\u00f8lge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|website=Kvart & B\u00f8lge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|accessdate=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710195941/https://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|archive-date=10 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/celebrity/october-kickstarter-projects_1.html|title=Top 10 Entertainment|author=|date=|website=AskMen|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nFull-range drivers often employ an additional cone called a ''whizzer'': a small, light cone attached to the joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing to keep up with the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.\n\nLimited-range drivers, also used alone, are typically found in computers, toys, and [[clock radio]]s. These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they may be severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.\n\n====Subwoofer====\n{{Main article|Subwoofer}}\nA [[subwoofer]] is a woofer driver used only for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200&nbsp;Hz for consumer systems,<ref name=\"crutchfield.com\">[http://www.crutchfield.com/S-5VsEXVgtser/Learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_glossary.html Home Speakers Glossary].

Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by [[diffraction]], the speaker aperture does not have to face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted in the bottom of the enclosure, facing the floor.  This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies;  such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.\n\nTo accurately reproduce very low bass notes without unwanted resonances (typically from cabinet panels), subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed and properly braced to avoid unwanted sounds of cabinet vibrations. As a result, good subwoofers are typically quite heavy. Many subwoofer systems include integrated [[power amplifier]]s and electronic [[Infrasound|subsonic]] (sub)-filters, with additional controls relevant to low-frequency reproduction (e.g., a crossover knob and a phase switch). These variants are known as \"active\" or \"powered\" subwoofers, with the former including a power amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Terms |work=Home Theater Design |publisher=ETS-eTech |page=1 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723231911/http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |archivedate=July 23, 2012 }}</ref> In contrast, \"passive\" subwoofers require external amplification.\n\nIn typical installations, subwoofers are physically separated from the rest of the speaker cabinets.  Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound.  Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the crossover point).  However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called [[standing waves]]) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue [[sound reinforcement system]]s. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a [[bass reflex]] port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.\n\n====Woofer====\n{{Main article|Woofer}}\nA [[woofer]] is a driver that reproduces low frequencies. The driver works with the characteristics of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies (see [[speaker enclosure]] for some of the design choices available). Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use.  Only at design time do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.\n\n====Mid-range driver====\n{{Main article|Mid-range speaker}}\nA [[mid-range speaker]] is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces a band of frequencies generally between 1\u20136&nbsp;kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be [[compression driver]]s (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the throat of a horn for added output level and control of radiation pattern.\n\n====Tweeter====\n[[File:Tw15ul9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] of a dome tweeter.]]\n{{Main article|Tweeter}}\nA [[tweeter]] is a high-frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system.  A major problem in tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (off-axis response), since high frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams.  Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.<ref>Nieuwendijk, Joris A.

Coaxial drivers have been produced by many companies, such as [[Altec Lansing|Altec]], [[Tannoy]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[KEF]], SEAS, B&C Speakers, BMS, [[Cabasse (company)|Cabasse]] and [[Genelec]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Genelec 8260A Technical Paper |url=http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |date=September 2009 |website= |publisher=Genelec |pages=3\u20134 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230170304/http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=30 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n==System design==\n[[File:SpeakerSymbol.png|100px|thumb|Electronic symbol for a speaker]]\n\n===Crossover===\n{{Main article|Audio crossover}}\n[[File:Passive Crossover.svg|thumb|right|A passive crossover.]]\n[[File:Active Crossover.svg|thumb|right|Bi-amped.]]Used in [[multi-driver speaker systems]], the crossover is an assembly of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. \"bands\"), according to the requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the sound frequency range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect out-of-band attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation (\"ripple\") within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.\n\nCrossovers can be ''passive'' or ''active''. A [[Audio crossover#Passive crossovers|passive crossover]] is an electronic circuit that uses a combination of one or more [[resistor]]s, inductors, or non-polar [[capacitor]]s. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in [[damping factor]] before the voice coil <ref name=ActivePassive>Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/biamp-vs-passive.htm ''Active Vs.

Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.<ref>Boston Acoustic Society.

In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24&nbsp;dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances,<ref name=PassiveDesign>Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/lr-passive.htm ''Design of Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.</ref> and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world.<ref name=PassiveDesign/> When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, [[dynamic range compression]] and limiting) control.<ref name=ActivePassive/>\n\n===Enclosures===\n{{Main article|Loudspeaker enclosure}}\n[[File:4-Wege Lautsprecher.jpg|thumb|right|An unusual three-way speaker system. The cabinet is narrow to raise the frequency where a diffraction effect called the \"baffle step\" occurs.]]\nMost loudspeaker systems consist of drivers mounted in an [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]], or cabinet. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from the back of a driver from interfering destructively with those from the front.  The sound waves emitted from the back are 180\u00b0 [[out of phase]] with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they  typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.\n\nThe simplest driver mount is a flat panel (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength longer than the baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation from the rear of the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/qa0604-6.htm Q. Sound On Sound, June 2004. ''What's the difference between ported and un-ported monitors?'']</ref><ref>[http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 Record Producer. ''Infinite baffle''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102014320/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 |date=January 2, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSince panels of infinite dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear radiation from the moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls\u2014or more rarely, [[visco-elastic]] materials (e.g., mineral-loaded [[bitumen]]) or thin [[lead]] sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.\n\nHowever, a rigid enclosure reflects sound internally, which can then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm\u2014again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials (often called \"damping\"), such as [[glass wool]], wool, or synthetic fiber batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.\n\nOther enclosure types alter the rear sound radiation so it can add constructively to the output from the front of the cone. Designs that do this (including ''[[bass reflex]]'', ''passive radiator'', ''transmission line'', etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.\n\nTo make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver is in the same vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.\n\nThe speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause [[diffraction]], resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, or some combination of these and other schemes.\n\n====Horn loudspeakers====\n[[File:3-way horn speaker.png|thumb|A three-way loudspeaker that uses horns in front of each of the three drivers: a shallow horn for the tweeter, a long, straight horn for mid frequencies and a folded horn for the woofer]]\n{{Main article|Horn loudspeaker}}\n[[Horn loudspeaker]]s are the oldest form of loudspeaker system. The use of [[Horn (acoustic)|horns]] as voice-amplifying [[megaphone]]s dates at least to the 17th century,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Trumpet, Speaking and Hearing}}</ref> and horns were used in mechanical [[Phonograph|gramophones]] as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition at the mouth of the horn. This improves the acoustic\u2014electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.\n\nThe size of the throat, mouth, the length of the horn, as well as the area expansion rate along it must be carefully chosen to match the drive to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies (every horn performs poorly outside its acoustic limits, at both high and low frequencies). The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn require a horn many feet long. 'Folded' horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased complication such as cost and construction. Some horn designs not only fold the low frequency horn, but use the walls in a room corner as an extension of the horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans. Room sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.\n\nA horn loaded speaker can have a sensitivity as high as 110&nbsp;dB at 2.83 volts (1 watt at 8 ohms) at 1 meter. This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a speaker rated at 90&nbsp;dB sensitivity, and is invaluable in applications where high sound levels are required or amplifier power is limited.\n\n==== Transmission line loudspeaker ====\n{{Main article|Transmission line loudspeaker}}\nA [[transmission line loudspeaker]] is a loudspeaker enclosure design which uses an [[acoustic transmission line]] within the cabinet, compared to the simpler enclosures used by sealed (closed) or [[Bass reflex|ported (bass reflex)]] designs. Instead of reverberating in a fairly simple damped enclosure, sound from the back of the bass speaker is directed into a long (generally folded) damped pathway within the speaker enclosure, which allows far greater control and use of speaker energy and the resulting sound.\n\n===Wiring connections===\n[[File:Banana plugs speaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Binding post|Two-way binding posts]] on a loudspeaker, connected using [[Banana connector|banana plugs]].]]\n[[File:bi-amp capable.jpg|thumb|right|A 4-ohm loudspeaker with two pairs of binding posts capable of accepting bi-wiring after the removal of two metal straps.]]\n\nMost home [[hi-fi]] loudspeakers use two wiring points to connect to the source of the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have [[binding post]]s, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper [[electrical polarity]] (the + and \u2212 connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and \u2212 to \u2212;  speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be \"out of phase\" or more properly \"out of polarity\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&pg=PA186|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|first1=Gary|last1=Davis|first2=Gary D.|last2=Davis|date=14 April 1989|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780881889000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L38MrvScG3gC&pg=PA298|title=The Audio Dictionary: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|first1=Glenn D.|last1=White|first2=Gary J.|last2=Louie|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780295801704}}</ref> Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA57|title=Audio in Media|first=Stanley R.|last=Alten|date=22 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781285675299}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1t0GxyvVbMC&pg=PA130|title=Guide to Sound Systems for Worship|first=Jon F.|last=Eiche|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780793500291}}</ref>\n\nWith [[sound reinforcement system]], [[PA system]] and [[instrument amplifier]] speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4\" speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use [[Speakon]] connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.\n\n===Wireless speakers===\n{{main article|Wireless speaker}}\n[[File:HP Roar Wireless Speaker.jpg|thumbnail|right|HP Roar Wireless Speaker]]\n[[Wireless speakers]] are very similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an [[active loudspeaker]]. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.\n\nWireless speakers still need power, so require a nearby AC power outlet, or possibly batteries. Only the wire to the amplifier is eliminated.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Eltax Silverstone 200 loudspeaker label.jpg|thumb|Specifications label on a loudspeaker.]]\nSpeaker specifications generally include:\n* '''Speaker or driver type''' (individual units only)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Full-range]], woofer, tweeter, or [[Mid-range speaker|mid-range]].\n* '''Size''' of individual drivers.

Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material\u2014commonly without reference to frequency range or distortion level.\n\n===Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers===\n{{Main article|Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers}}\n\nThe load that a driver presents to an amplifier consists of a complex [[electrical impedance]]\u2014a combination of resistance and both [[Capacitance|capacitive]] and [[Inductance|inductive]] [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), and the effects of air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal [[resistive]] load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.\n\nTo make sound, a loudspeaker is driven by modulated electric current (produced by an [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]) that passes through a \"speaker coil\"  which then (through [[Electrical inductance|inductance]]) creates a magnetic field around the coil, creating a [[magnetic field]]. The electric current variations that pass through the speaker are thus converted to a varying magnetic field, whose interaction with the driver's magnetic field moves the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce air motion that is similar to the original signal from the amplifier.\n\n===Electromechanical measurements===\nExamples of typical [[Loudspeaker measurement|measurements]] are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under one or more conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); [[harmonic distortion|harmonic]] and [[intermodulation distortion]] vs. [[Sound pressure|sound pressure level]] (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/solutions/testing-devices/speaker.aspx|title=Equipment used for speaker, driver & cabinet testing|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}</ref> to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value\u2014sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in [[decibel]]s ([[DBSPL|dB<sub>spl</sub>]]).\n\n===Efficiency vs. sensitivity===\nLoudspeaker efficiency is defined as the [[sound power]] output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper [[impedance matching]] between the [[acoustic impedance]] of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.\n\nDriver ratings based on the SPL for a given input are called sensitivity ratings and are notionally similar to efficiency. [[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] is usually defined as so many decibels at 1&nbsp;W electrical input, measured at 1 meter (except for [[headphones]]), often at a single frequency. The voltage used is often 2.83&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>, which is 1&nbsp;watt into an 8&nbsp;\u03a9 (nominal) speaker impedance (approximately true for many speaker systems). Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as dB with 2.83&nbsp;V @ 1&nbsp;m.\n\nThe sound pressure output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be equivalent to a measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), under the condition that the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an [[infinite baffle]]. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus \"focusing\" them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.\n\n* Typical home loudspeakers have sensitivities of about 85 to 95&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m\u2014an efficiency of 0.5\u20134%.\n* Sound reinforcement and public address loudspeakers have sensitivities of perhaps 95 to 102&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m\u2014an efficiency of 4\u201310%.\n* Rock concert, stadium PA, marine hailing, etc. speakers generally have higher sensitivities of 103 to 110&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m\u2014an efficiency of 10\u201320%.\n\nA driver with a higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3&nbsp;dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3&nbsp;dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100&nbsp;W driver (\"A\") rated at 92&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200&nbsp;W driver (\"B\") rated at 89&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m when both are driven with 100&nbsp;W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100&nbsp;W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or [[loudness]] as speaker B would produce with 200&nbsp;W input. Thus, a 3&nbsp;dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier\u2014and often, to reduced overall system cost.\n\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Hofmann's Iron Law]] -->\n{{anchor|Hofmann}}It is typically not possible to combine high efficiency (especially at low frequencies) with compact enclosure size and adequate low frequency response. One can, for the most part, choose only two of the three parameters when designing a speaker system.

Most listening rooms present a more or less reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from [[resonant room modes]]), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.\n\nA significant factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.\n\n===Placement===\nIn a typical rectangular listening room, the hard, parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling cause primary [[acoustic resonance]] nodes in each of the three dimensions: left-right, up-down and forward-backward.<ref>\"Acoustics\", Leo Beranek, chapter 10, McGraw Hill Books, 1954</ref> Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving three, four, five and even all six boundary surfaces combining to create [[standing wave]]s. Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium size rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the [[Schroeder frequency]]&nbsp;\u2013 typically around 200\u2013300&nbsp;Hz, depending on room size.\n\n===Directivity===\nAcousticians, in studying the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally, independent of frequency.\n\nAny object radiating sound, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; others are not.\n\nOne simple combination is two simple sources separated by a distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair is known as a doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.\n\n[[File:Bosch 36W column loudspeaker polar pattern.png|thumb|Polar plots of a four-driver industrial columnar [[public address]] loudspeaker taken at six frequencies. Note how the pattern is nearly omnidirectional at low frequencies, converging to a wide fan-shaped pattern at 1 kHz, then separating into lobes and getting weaker at higher frequencies<ref>Polar pattern File: Speaker is a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] 36 watt [http://www.boschcommunications.us/ProductFamily/Plena%20Public%20Address%20Systems/ProductType/Loudspeakers%20-%20Column/ LA1-UW36-x columnar model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918082043/http://www.boschcommunications.us/ProductFamily/Plena%20Public%20Address%20Systems/ProductType/Loudspeakers%20-%20Column/ |date=2008-09-18 }} with four identical 4-inch drivers arranged vertically in an enclosure {{convert|841|mm|in|abbr=on}}ch) high. Polar prediction software is [http://www.clfgroup.org/viewer.htm CLF viewer]. Loudspeaker information was gathered by the manufacturer into a CF2 file.</ref>]]\nIn real life, individual drivers are complex 3D shapes such as cones and domes, and they are placed on a baffle for various reasons. A mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on modeling combinations of point sources, is usually not possible, but in the far field, the directivity of a loudspeaker with a circular diaphragm is close to that of a flat circular piston, so it can be used as an illustrative simplification for discussion. As a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following:\nthe formula for far field directivity of a flat circular piston in an infinite baffle is <small><math>p(\\theta) = \\frac{p_0 J_1(k_a \\sin \\theta)}{k_a \\sin \\theta}</math></small>\nwhere <small><math>k_a=\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda}</math></small>, <small><math>p_0</math></small> is the pressure on axis, <small><math>a</math></small> is the piston radius, <small><math>\\lambda</math></small> is the wavelength (i.e. <small><math>\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f} = \\frac{\\text{speed of sound}}{\\text{frequency}}</math></small>) <small><math>\\theta</math></small> is the angle off axis and <small><math>J_1</math></small> is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind.\n\nA planar source radiates sound uniformly for low frequencies' wavelengths longer than the dimensions of the planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of directivity occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.\n\nVarious manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called [[studio monitor|monitors]], as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose\u2014the 2201. Later [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in [[Bose Corporation#Criticisms|high fidelity circles]], but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.\n\nDirectivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed 'beamy') speaker (i.e., on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a reverberant field lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble even though it measures well on axis (e.g., \"flat\" across the entire frequency range). Speakers with very wide, or rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies, can give the impression that there is too much treble (if the listener is on axis) or too little (if the listener is off axis). This is part of the reason why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.\n\n==Other speaker designs==\n\nWhile dynamic cone speakers remain the most popular choice, many other speaker technologies exist.\n\n===With a diaphragm===\n\n====Moving-iron loudspeakers====\n{{main article|Moving iron speaker}}\n[[image:Moving-iron_cone_speaker_1929.png|thumb|right|200px|Moving iron speaker]]\nThe moving iron speaker was the first type of speaker that was invented. Unlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a stationary coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature).  The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself.  This design was the original loudspeaker design, dating back to the early telephone.  Moving iron drivers are inefficient and can only produce a small band of sound.  They require large magnets and coils to increase force.<ref name=\"moving iron\">{{cite web|title=The Moving-Iron Speaker|url=http://www.vias.org/crowhurstba/crowhurst_basic_audio_vol1_042.html|website=vias.org}}</ref>\n\nBalanced armature drivers (a type of moving iron driver) use an armature that moves like a see-saw or diving board.  Since they are not damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances.  They are still used today for high end [[earphones]] and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.<ref name=\"balanced armature\">{{cite web|last1=Hertsens|first1=Tyll|title=How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work|url=http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work#IboPCt5E0YtmLTAL.97|website=innerfidelity|date=2014-12-16}}</ref>\n\n====Piezoelectric speakers====\n{{main article|Piezoelectric speaker}}\n{{See also|Piezo tweeter}}\n[[File:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|A piezoelectric buzzer. The white ceramic piezoelectric material can be seen fixed to a metal diaphragm.]]\nPiezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in [[watch]]es and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they are resistant to overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, and they can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.\n\nPiezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency output, and this is useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, [[sonar]] applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of [[underwater microphone]]s). They have advantages in these applications, not the least of which is simple and solid state construction that resists seawater better than a ribbon or cone based device would.\n\nIn 2013, [[Kyocera]] introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only 1 millimeter of thickness and 7 grams of weight for their 55\" [[OLED]] televisions and they hope the speakers will also be used in PCs and tablets. Besides medium-size, there are also large and small sizes which can all produce relatively the same quality of sound and volume within 180 degrees. The highly responsive speaker material provides better clarity than traditional TV speakers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/kyocera-piezoelectric-film-speaker/#continued |title=Kyocera piezoelectric film speaker delivers 180-degree sound to thin TVs and tablets (update: live photos) |date=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Magnetostatic loudspeakers====\n{{Main article|Magnetostatic loudspeaker}}\n[[File:Magnepan MG1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Magnetostatic loudspeaker]]\nInstead of a voice coil driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it.  Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.\n\n====Magnetostrictive speakers====\nMagnetostrictive transducers, based on [[magnetostriction]], have been predominantly used as [[sonar]] ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex<ref>{{cite web|first=Takeyoshi |last=Yamada |title=Fostex Prototypes Tabletop Vibration Speaker System Using Super Magnetostrictor |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20051117/110823/ |publisher=Tech-On! |location= |date=November 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-05 |quote=The cone-shaped speaker system is 95 mm in diameter and 90 mm high.

The thickness of the diaphragm and grids has been exaggerated for the purpose of illustration.]]\n[[Electrostatic loudspeaker]]s use a high voltage electric field (rather than a magnetic field) to drive a thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning.  However, their optimum listening area is small and they are not very efficient speakers.  They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations\u2014the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency.  This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.\n\nElectrostatics are inherently dipole radiators and due to the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature, and the bass [[roll-off|rolls off]] at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.\n\nElectrostatics are usually driven through a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage swings produced by the power amplifier.  This transformer also multiplies the capacitive load that is inherent in electrostatic transducers, which means the effective impedance presented to the power amplifiers varies widely by frequency.  A speaker that is nominally 8 ohms may actually present a load of 1 ohm at higher frequencies, which is challenging to some amplifier designs.\n\n====Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers====\nA '''ribbon speaker''' consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little [[mass]]; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile\u2014some can be torn by a strong gust of air. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier \"sees\" a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer turns ratio squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.\n\nPlanar magnetic speakers (having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm) are sometimes described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The [[Laplace force|current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field]] of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.\n\n====Bending wave loudspeakers====\nBending wave transducers use a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity of the material increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach the edge of the speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80&nbsp;Hz to 35,000&nbsp;Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source.<ref>[http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/687ohm/ Stereophile magazine. ''Ohm Walsh 5 loudspeaker'' (review by Dick Olsher, June 1987)]</ref> This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.\n\nThe Ohm Walsh loudspeakers use a unique driver designed by [[Lincoln Walsh]], who had been a radar development engineer in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back-and-forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a \"transmission line\". The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then.  German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.\n\nThe German firm, Manger, has designed and produced a bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional. In fact, the round panel attached to the voice coil bends in a carefully controlled way to produce full range sound.<ref>Manger, Josef W. [http://issuu.com/manger-msw/docs/acoustical_reality-1-?mode=window&viewMode=singlePage \"Acoustical Reality\"].</ref> Josef W. Manger was awarded with the \"Diesel Medal\" for extraordinary developments and inventions by the German institute of inventions.\n\n====Flat panel loudspeakers====\nThere have been many attempts to reduce the size of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of \"exciter\" transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. Some progress has been made using such lightweight, rigid, materials such as [[Styrofoam]], and there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.desireeasy.com/2018/11/abuzhen-mini-portable-wireless.html|title=Abuzhen Mini Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker|website=www.desireeasy.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206102224/https://www.desireeasy.com/2018/11/abuzhen-mini-portable-wireless.html|archive-date=6 December 2018|url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Heil air motion transducers====\n{{Main article|Air Motion Transformer}}\n[[Image:AirMotionTransformer.png|right|thumb|300px|In Heil's air motion transducer, current through the membrane 2 causes it to move left and right in magnetic field 6, moving air in and out along directions 8; barriers 4 prevent air from moving in unintended directions.]]\n[[Oskar Heil]] invented the air motion transducer in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in a magnetic field and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats in accordance with the imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic tweeter designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Lafayette Radio]], a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany\u2014one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.\n\n====Transparent ionic conduction speaker====\nIn 2013, a research team introduced Transparent ionic conduction speaker which a 2 layers transparent conductive gel and a layer of transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality.

Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the [[Plasmatronics]] Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from [[helium]] gas.<ref name=nutshellhifi>[http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/speaker-design1.html Hill Plasmatronics] described.

Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent [[analog digital conversion]] problems, the effect of [[aliasing]] is unavoidable, so that the audio output is \"reflected\" at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the [[Nyquist limit]] (half the sampling frequency), causing an unacceptably high level of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]s to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.\n\nThe term \"digital\" or \"digital-ready\" is often used for marketing purposes on speakers or [[headphones]], but these systems are not digital in the sense described above. Rather, they are conventional speakers that can be used with digital sound sources (e.g., [[optical media]], [[MP3]] players, etc.), as can any conventional speaker.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Association of Loudspeaker Manufacturing & Acoustics International]] (ALMA)\n*[[Audio power]]\n*[[Audiophile]]\n*[[Bandwidth extension]]\n*[[Directional sound]]\n*[[Dust cap]]\n*[[Echo cancellation]]\n*[[Electronics]]\n*[[Ferrofluid#Heat transfer]]\n*[[Guitar speaker]]\n*[[Headphones]]\n*[[High-end audio]]\n*[[Isobaric loudspeaker]]\n*[[List of loudspeaker manufacturers]]\n*[[Loudspeaker acoustics]]\n*[[Long Range Acoustic Device]](LRAD)\n*[[Music centre]]\n*[[Parabolic loudspeaker]]\n*[[Phase plug]]\n*[[Planephones]]\n*[[Rotary woofer]]\n*[[Sound]]\n*[[Sound from ultrasound]]\n*[[Soundbar]]\n*[[Speaker driver]]\n*[[Speaker stands]]\n*[[Speaker wire]]\n*[[Speakerphone]]\n*[[Studio monitor]]\n*[[Super tweeter]]\n*[[Surround sound]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Loudspeaker|Loudspeakers}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.almainternational.org/ ALMA&nbsp;\u2013 A Forum for the Global Loudspeaker Industry]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-efficiency.htm Conversion of sensitivity to energy efficiency in percent for passive loudspeakers]\n*[https://www.sps.tue.nl/rmaarts/RMA_papers/aar06pu1.pdf Article on sensitivity and efficiency of loudspeakers]\n*[http://www.lenardaudio.com/education/05_speakers.html Speaker Principles Illustrated guide to loudspeaker design and practice]\n\n{{Music technology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Loudspeakers| ]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1924]]\n[[Category:Audio engineering]]\n[[Category:Music technology]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Loudspeaker (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Electrodynamic-loudspeaker.png|thumb|Loudspeaker for home use with three types of dynamic drivers {{ordered list |Mid-range driver |Tweeter |Woofers}} The hole below the lowest woofer is a port for a [[bass reflex]] system.]]\n{{ordered list |Midwoofers are isolated from the rest of the cabinet in perforated, cardioid chambers to create a cardioic dispersion pattern that reduces the midrange reflections. |Woofers are located to the sides (beneath the black cover)|Double-vented port ([[bass reflex]]) design on the rear side}}]]\nA '''loudspeaker''' (or '''loud-speaker''' or '''speaker''') is an [[Acoustical engineering#Electroacoustics|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]];<ref name=\"Ballou\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Ballou\n | first1 = Glen \n | title  = Handbook for Sound Engineers, 4th Ed.\n | publisher = Taylor and Francis\n | date   = 2008\n | location = \n | page  = 597\n | language = English\n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=eh60Ue_K2QkC&pg=PA597&dq=%22loudspeaker%22electroacoustic%22transducer\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 978-1136122538\n }}</ref> a device which converts an electrical [[audio signal]] into a corresponding [[sound]].<ref name=\"Talbot-Smith\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Talbot-Smith\n | first1 = Michael \n | title  = Audio Engineer's Reference Book\n | publisher = CRC Press\n | date   = 1999\n | location = \n | pages  = 2.52\n | language = English\n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=gDPJAwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA52&dq=%22loudspeaker\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 978-1136119743\n }}</ref>  The most widely used type of speaker in the 2010s is the '''dynamic speaker,''' invented in 1924 by [[Edward W. Kellogg]] and [[Chester W. Rice]].  The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a [[dynamic microphone]], but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical [[audio signal]] is applied to its [[voice coil]], a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a [[permanent magnet]], the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to [[Faraday's law of induction]], which causes a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create [[sound wave]]s. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an [[audio power amplifier]] before the signal is sent to the speaker.  \n\nSpeakers are typically housed in a [[speaker enclosure]] or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular  square box made of several forms of wood, or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design play an important role in the quality of the sound. The enclosure generally must be as stiff and non-resonant as practically possible. Where [[high fidelity]] reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range ''(picture at right)''.  In this case the individual speakers are referred to as \"drivers\" and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker.  Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called [[tweeter]]s, those for middle frequencies are called [[mid-range speaker|mid-range]] drivers, and those for low frequencies are called [[woofer]]s. Extremely low frequencies (16Hz-~100Hz) may be reproduced by detached [[subwoofer]]s. Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as [[Radio receiver|radios]], [[television]]s, portable audio players, [[computer]]s, and [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] in theatres and concert halls, and in [[public address system]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"loudspeaker\" may refer to individual transducers (also known as \"drivers\") or to complete speaker systems consisting of an [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]] including one or more drivers.\n \nTo adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher [[sound pressure level]] or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named [[subwoofer]]s (for very low frequencies); [[woofer]]s (low frequencies); [[mid-range speaker]]s (middle frequencies); [[tweeter]]s (high frequencies); and sometimes [[supertweeters]], optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds is divided between the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation \"tweeter\" for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as \"HF\" or \"highs\". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a \"filter network\", called a [[Audio crossover|crossover]], separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with ''n'' separate frequency bands is described as \"''n''-way speakers\": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker drivers of the type pictured are termed  \"dynamic\" (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., [[moving iron speaker]]), or speakers using [[Piezoelectric speakers#Piezo tweeter|piezoelectric]] or [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] systems, or any of several other sorts.\n\n==History==\n[[Johann Philipp Reis]] installed an electric loudspeaker in his ''[[telephone]]'' in 1861; it was capable of reproducing clear tones, but also could reproduce muffled [[speech]] after a few revisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis|title=The Forgotten Johann Philipp Reis|last=|first=|date=|website=Integrated Network Cables|accessdate=2015-06-11|df=}}</ref> [[Alexander Graham Bell]] patented his first electric loudspeaker (capable of reproducing intelligible speech) as part of his telephone in 1876, which was followed in 1877 by an improved version from [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Siemens]]. During this time, [[Thomas Edison]] was issued a British patent for a system using compressed air as an amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs, but he ultimately settled for the familiar metal horn driven by a membrane attached to the stylus. In 1898, Horace Short patented a design for a loudspeaker driven by compressed air; he then sold the rights to [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], who was issued several additional British patents before 1910. A few companies, including the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and [[Path\u00e9]], produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers. However, these designs were significantly limited by their poor sound quality and their inability to reproduce sound at low volume. Variants of the system were used for [[public address]] applications, and more recently, other variations have been used to test space-equipment resistance to the very loud sound and vibration levels that the launching of rockets produces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/auxetophone/auxetoph.htm |title=The Auxetophone & Other Compressed-Air Gramophones |accessdate=2019-01-20}}</ref>\n=== Moving-coil ===\nThe first experimental moving-coil (also called ''dynamic'') loudspeaker was invented by [[Oliver Lodge]] in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aes-media.org/historical/html/recording.technology.history/loudspeaker.html |title=Loudspeaker History |accessdate=2019-01-20}}</ref> The first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by Danish engineer [[Peter L.

The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a [[inductor|choke coil]], filtering the [[power supply]] of the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]] that the loudspeaker was connected to.<ref>Henry B.

However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 [[Peter L.

This allowed for better bass response than previously from drivers mounted in smaller cabinets which was important during the transition to stereo recording and reproduction.  He and his partner [[Henry Kloss]] formed the [[Acoustic Research]] company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle.  Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}<!--citation also needed in [[Acoustic suspension]]--> The most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent [[magnet]] materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis.

A protective cap glued in the cone's center prevents dust, especially iron filings, from entering the gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the [[voice coil]], a [[magnetic field]] is created by the electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound under the control of the applied electrical signal coming from the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.\n\n=== Diaphragm ===\nThe diaphragm is usually manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A variety of different materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well [[Absorption (acoustics)|damped]], to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped with little or no audible ringing due to its [[resonance]] frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves [[trade-off]]s. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some [[carbon fiber]], [[Kevlar]], [[Glass (fiber)|glass]], [[hemp]] or [[bamboo]] fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.\n\n=== Basket ===\nThe chassis, frame, or basket, is designed to be rigid, preventing deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps allowing the voice coil to rub against the magnet around the gap. Chassis are typically [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from aluminum alloy, in heavier magnet-structure speakers; or [[machine press|stamped]] from thin sheet steel in lighter-structure drivers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound and recording|date=2009|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-240-52163-3|page=81|edition=6th}}</ref> Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers.   Metallic chassis can play an important role in conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, broils the varnish on the voice coil; it may even demagnetize permanent magnets.\n\nThe suspension system keeps the coil centered in the gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving. A typical suspension system consists of two parts: the ''spider'', which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the lower frame and provides the majority of the restoring force, and the ''surround'', which helps center the coil/cone assembly and allows free pistonic motion aligned with the magnetic gap. The spider is usually made of a [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin. The name comes from the shape of early suspensions, which were two concentric rings of [[Bakelite]] material, joined by six or eight curved \"legs.\" Variations of this topology included the addition of a felt disc to provide a barrier to particles that might otherwise cause the voice coil to rub. The German firm Rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made of wood.\n\n=== Cone materials ===\nThe cone surround can be [[rubber]] or polyester [[foam]], or a ring of concentrically corrugated, resin coated fabric; it is attached to both the outer cone circumference and to the upper frame. These diverse surround materials, their shape and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of a driver; each implementation has advantages and disadvantages. Polyester foam, for example, is lightweight and economical, though usually leaks air to some degree, but is degraded by time, exposure to ozone, UV light, humidity and elevated temperatures, limiting useful life before failure. Treated paper surrounds will eventually fail.\nNeoprene rubber and resin-coated fabric surrounds are longer-lasting. \nThe wire in a voice coil is usually made of [[copper]], though [[aluminum]]\u2014and, rarely, [[silver]]\u2014may be used.  The advantage of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper.  This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency.  A disadvantage of aluminum is that it is not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed.  These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration.  Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside ring of the gap is one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) is the other. The pole piece and backplate are often made as a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.\n\nModern driver magnets are almost always permanent and made of [[ceramic]], [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], [[alnico]], or, more recently, [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth]] such as [[neodymium]] and [[Samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium cobalt]]. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s;  there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design \u2014 due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) \u2014 is the use of the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce [[field coil loudspeaker|electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils]], as was common in the earliest designs;  one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by \"recharging\" the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.\n\nAfter 1980, most (but not quite all) driver manufacturers switched from alnico to ferrite magnets, which are made from a mix of ceramic clay and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite. Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than alnico, it is substantially less expensive, allowing designers to use larger yet more economical magnets to achieve a given performance.\n\nThe size and type of magnet and details of the magnetic circuit differ, depending on design goals. For instance, the shape of the pole piece affects the magnetic interaction between the voice coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify a driver's behavior. A \"shorting ring\", or [[Faraday loop]], may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.\n\nDriver design\u2014including the particular way two or more drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system\u2014is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of [[timbre]] and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Don |author2=Carolyn Davis |title=Sound System Engineering |publisher=Focal Press |year=1997 |edition=2 |page=350 |chapter=Loudspeakers and Loudspeaker Arrays |isbn=978-0-240-80305-0 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouyzH6vsIIwC&pg=PA350 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |language= |quote=We often give lip service to the fact that audio allows its practitioners to engage in both art and science.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fremer |first=Michael |date=April 2004 |title=Aerial Model 20T loudspeaker |journal=Stereophile |url=http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/404aerial/# |accessdate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/arts/home-entertainment-speaker-design-goes-modern.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Speaker Design Goes Modern |last=Fantel |first=Hans |date=June 6, 1993 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref> Adjusting a design to improve performance is done using a combination of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an [[anechoic chamber]] to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.\n\nFabrication of finished loudspeaker systems has become segmented, depending largely on price, shipping costs, and weight limitations. High-end speaker systems, which are typically heavier (and often larger) than economic shipping allows outside local regions, are usually made in their target market region and can cost $140,000 or more per pair.<ref>[http://www.nolaspeakers.com/reviews/tas/EditorsChoice2007.html The Absolute Sound, issue 175, October 2007. hp's Workshop: HP's Editor's Choice Awards.

Each of the four drivers outputs a different frequency range; the fifth aperture at the bottom is a [[bass reflex]] port.]]\n\nIndividual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g., subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three most commonly used sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn type drivers.\n\n====Full-range drivers====\n{{Main article|Full-range speaker}}\nA full-range driver is a speaker designed to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel without the help of other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically {{convert|3|to|8|in|cm}} in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some [[computer speaker]]s, etc. In [[hi-fi]] speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures\u2014such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns\u2014to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low-cost quarter-wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|title=Kvart & B\u00f8lge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|website=Kvart & B\u00f8lge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|accessdate=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710195941/https://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|archive-date=10 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/celebrity/october-kickstarter-projects_1.html|title=Top 10 Entertainment|author=|date=|website=AskMen|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nFull-range drivers often employ an additional cone called a ''whizzer'': a small, light cone attached to the joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing to keep up with the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.\n\nLimited-range drivers, also used alone, are typically found in computers, toys, and [[clock radio]]s. These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they may be severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.\n\n====Subwoofer====\n{{Main article|Subwoofer}}\nA [[subwoofer]] is a woofer driver used only for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200&nbsp;Hz for consumer systems,<ref name=\"crutchfield.com\">[http://www.crutchfield.com/S-5VsEXVgtser/Learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_glossary.html Home Speakers Glossary].

Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by [[diffraction]], the speaker aperture does not have to face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted in the bottom of the enclosure, facing the floor.  This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies;  such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.\n\nTo accurately reproduce very low bass notes without unwanted resonances (typically from cabinet panels), subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed and properly braced to avoid unwanted sounds of cabinet vibrations. As a result, good subwoofers are typically quite heavy. Many subwoofer systems include integrated [[power amplifier]]s and electronic [[Infrasound|subsonic]] (sub)-filters, with additional controls relevant to low-frequency reproduction (e.g., a crossover knob and a phase switch). These variants are known as \"active\" or \"powered\" subwoofers, with the former including a power amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Terms |work=Home Theater Design |publisher=ETS-eTech |page=1 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723231911/http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |archivedate=July 23, 2012 }}</ref> In contrast, \"passive\" subwoofers require external amplification.\n\nIn typical installations, subwoofers are physically separated from the rest of the speaker cabinets.  Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound.  Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the crossover point).  However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called [[standing waves]]) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue [[sound reinforcement system]]s. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a [[bass reflex]] port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.\n\n====Woofer====\n{{Main article|Woofer}}\nA [[woofer]] is a driver that reproduces low frequencies. The driver works with the characteristics of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies (see [[speaker enclosure]] for some of the design choices available). Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use.  Only at design time do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.\n\n====Mid-range driver====\n{{Main article|Mid-range speaker}}\nA [[mid-range speaker]] is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces a band of frequencies generally between 1\u20136&nbsp;kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be [[compression driver]]s (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the throat of a horn for added output level and control of radiation pattern.\n\n====Tweeter====\n[[File:Tw15ul9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] of a dome tweeter.]]\n{{Main article|Tweeter}}\nA [[tweeter]] is a high-frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system.  A major problem in tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (off-axis response), since high frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams.  Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.<ref>Nieuwendijk, Joris A. (1988) [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=5129 \"Compact Ribbon Tweeter/Midrange Loudspeaker.\"] Audio Engineering Society.</ref>\n\n====Coaxial drivers====\nA coaxial driver is a loudspeaker driver with two or several combined concentric drivers. Coaxial drivers have been produced by many companies, such as [[Altec Lansing|Altec]], [[Tannoy]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[KEF]], SEAS, B&C Speakers, BMS, [[Cabasse (company)|Cabasse]] and [[Genelec]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Genelec 8260A Technical Paper |url=http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |date=September 2009 |website= |publisher=Genelec |pages=3\u20134 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230170304/http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=30 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n==System design==\n[[File:SpeakerSymbol.png|100px|thumb|Electronic symbol for a speaker]]\n\n===Crossover===\n{{Main article|Audio crossover}}\n[[File:Passive Crossover.svg|thumb|right|A passive crossover.]]\n[[File:Active Crossover.svg|thumb|right|Bi-amped.]]Used in [[multi-driver speaker systems]], the crossover is an assembly of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. \"bands\"), according to the requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the sound frequency range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect out-of-band attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation (\"ripple\") within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.\n\nCrossovers can be ''passive'' or ''active''. A [[Audio crossover#Passive crossovers|passive crossover]] is an electronic circuit that uses a combination of one or more [[resistor]]s, inductors, or non-polar [[capacitor]]s. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in [[damping factor]] before the voice coil <ref name=ActivePassive>Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/biamp-vs-passive.htm ''Active Vs. Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.</ref> An [[Audio crossover#Active crossovers|active crossover]] is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands ''before'' power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass.<ref name=ActivePassive/> Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.<ref>Boston Acoustic Society. ''The B.A.S. Speaker'', September 1978. Peter W. Mitchell: \"The D-23 crossover can be used for bi-amping, tri-amping, or even quad-amping.\"</ref>\n\nSome loudspeaker designs use a combination of passive and active crossover filtering, such as a passive crossover between the mid- and high-frequency drivers and an active crossover between the low-frequency driver and the combined mid- and high frequencies.<ref>EAW [http://www.eaw.com/products/KF/kf300.html ''KF300/600 Series&nbsp;\u2014 Compact three-way VAT Systems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424065507/http://www.eaw.com/products/kf/kf300.html |date=2012-04-24 }}.

Three-way loudspeaker switchable between bi-amped and fully passive modes. </ref>\n\nPassive crossovers are commonly installed inside speaker boxes and are by far the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24&nbsp;dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances,<ref name=PassiveDesign>Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/lr-passive.htm ''Design of Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.</ref> and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world.<ref name=PassiveDesign/> When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, [[dynamic range compression]] and limiting) control.<ref name=ActivePassive/>\n\n===Enclosures===\n{{Main article|Loudspeaker enclosure}}\n[[File:4-Wege Lautsprecher.jpg|thumb|right|An unusual three-way speaker system. The cabinet is narrow to raise the frequency where a diffraction effect called the \"baffle step\" occurs.]]\nMost loudspeaker systems consist of drivers mounted in an [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]], or cabinet. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from the back of a driver from interfering destructively with those from the front.  The sound waves emitted from the back are 180\u00b0 [[out of phase]] with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they  typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.\n\nThe simplest driver mount is a flat panel (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength longer than the baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation from the rear of the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/qa0604-6.htm Q. Sound On Sound, June 2004. ''What's the difference between ported and un-ported monitors?'']</ref><ref>[http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 Record Producer. ''Infinite baffle''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102014320/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 |date=January 2, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSince panels of infinite dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear radiation from the moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls\u2014or more rarely, [[visco-elastic]] materials (e.g., mineral-loaded [[bitumen]]) or thin [[lead]] sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.\n\nHowever, a rigid enclosure reflects sound internally, which can then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm\u2014again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials (often called \"damping\"), such as [[glass wool]], wool, or synthetic fiber batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.\n\nOther enclosure types alter the rear sound radiation so it can add constructively to the output from the front of the cone. Designs that do this (including ''[[bass reflex]]'', ''passive radiator'', ''transmission line'', etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.\n\nTo make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver is in the same vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.\n\nThe speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause [[diffraction]], resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, or some combination of these and other schemes.\n\n====Horn loudspeakers====\n[[File:3-way horn speaker.png|thumb|A three-way loudspeaker that uses horns in front of each of the three drivers: a shallow horn for the tweeter, a long, straight horn for mid frequencies and a folded horn for the woofer]]\n{{Main article|Horn loudspeaker}}\n[[Horn loudspeaker]]s are the oldest form of loudspeaker system. The use of [[Horn (acoustic)|horns]] as voice-amplifying [[megaphone]]s dates at least to the 17th century,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Trumpet, Speaking and Hearing}}</ref> and horns were used in mechanical [[Phonograph|gramophones]] as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition at the mouth of the horn. This improves the acoustic\u2014electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.\n\nThe size of the throat, mouth, the length of the horn, as well as the area expansion rate along it must be carefully chosen to match the drive to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies (every horn performs poorly outside its acoustic limits, at both high and low frequencies). The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn require a horn many feet long. 'Folded' horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased complication such as cost and construction. Some horn designs not only fold the low frequency horn, but use the walls in a room corner as an extension of the horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans. Room sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.\n\nA horn loaded speaker can have a sensitivity as high as 110&nbsp;dB at 2.83 volts (1 watt at 8 ohms) at 1 meter. This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a speaker rated at 90&nbsp;dB sensitivity, and is invaluable in applications where high sound levels are required or amplifier power is limited.\n\n==== Transmission line loudspeaker ====\n{{Main article|Transmission line loudspeaker}}\nA [[transmission line loudspeaker]] is a loudspeaker enclosure design which uses an [[acoustic transmission line]] within the cabinet, compared to the simpler enclosures used by sealed (closed) or [[Bass reflex|ported (bass reflex)]] designs. Instead of reverberating in a fairly simple damped enclosure, sound from the back of the bass speaker is directed into a long (generally folded) damped pathway within the speaker enclosure, which allows far greater control and use of speaker energy and the resulting sound.\n\n===Wiring connections===\n[[File:Banana plugs speaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Binding post|Two-way binding posts]] on a loudspeaker, connected using [[Banana connector|banana plugs]].]]\n[[File:bi-amp capable.jpg|thumb|right|A 4-ohm loudspeaker with two pairs of binding posts capable of accepting bi-wiring after the removal of two metal straps.]]\n\nMost home [[hi-fi]] loudspeakers use two wiring points to connect to the source of the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have [[binding post]]s, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper [[electrical polarity]] (the + and \u2212 connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and \u2212 to \u2212;  speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be \"out of phase\" or more properly \"out of polarity\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&pg=PA186|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|first1=Gary|last1=Davis|first2=Gary D.|last2=Davis|date=14 April 1989|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780881889000}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L38MrvScG3gC&pg=PA298|title=The Audio Dictionary: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|first1=Glenn D.|last1=White|first2=Gary J.|last2=Louie|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780295801704}}</ref> Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA57|title=Audio in Media|first=Stanley R.|last=Alten|date=22 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781285675299}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1t0GxyvVbMC&pg=PA130|title=Guide to Sound Systems for Worship|first=Jon F.|last=Eiche|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780793500291}}</ref>\n\nWith [[sound reinforcement system]], [[PA system]] and [[instrument amplifier]] speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4\" speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use [[Speakon]] connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.\n\n===Wireless speakers===\n{{main article|Wireless speaker}}\n[[File:HP Roar Wireless Speaker.jpg|thumbnail|right|HP Roar Wireless Speaker]]\n[[Wireless speakers]] are very similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an [[active loudspeaker]]. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.\n\nWireless speakers still need power, so require a nearby AC power outlet, or possibly batteries. Only the wire to the amplifier is eliminated.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Eltax Silverstone 200 loudspeaker label.jpg|thumb|Specifications label on a loudspeaker.]]\nSpeaker specifications generally include:\n* '''Speaker or driver type''' (individual units only)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Full-range]], woofer, tweeter, or [[Mid-range speaker|mid-range]].\n* '''Size''' of individual drivers.

Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal [[resistive]] load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.\n\nTo make sound, a loudspeaker is driven by modulated electric current (produced by an [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]) that passes through a \"speaker coil\"  which then (through [[Electrical inductance|inductance]]) creates a magnetic field around the coil, creating a [[magnetic field]]. The electric current variations that pass through the speaker are thus converted to a varying magnetic field, whose interaction with the driver's magnetic field moves the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce air motion that is similar to the original signal from the amplifier.\n\n===Electromechanical measurements===\nExamples of typical [[Loudspeaker measurement|measurements]] are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under one or more conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); [[harmonic distortion|harmonic]] and [[intermodulation distortion]] vs. [[Sound pressure|sound pressure level]] (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/solutions/testing-devices/speaker.aspx|title=Equipment used for speaker, driver & cabinet testing|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}</ref> to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value\u2014sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in [[decibel]]s ([[DBSPL|dB<sub>spl</sub>]]).\n\n===Efficiency vs. sensitivity===\nLoudspeaker efficiency is defined as the [[sound power]] output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper [[impedance matching]] between the [[acoustic impedance]] of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.\n\nDriver ratings based on the SPL for a given input are called sensitivity ratings and are notionally similar to efficiency. [[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] is usually defined as so many decibels at 1&nbsp;W electrical input, measured at 1 meter (except for [[headphones]]), often at a single frequency. The voltage used is often 2.83&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>, which is 1&nbsp;watt into an 8&nbsp;\u03a9 (nominal) speaker impedance (approximately true for many speaker systems). Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as dB with 2.83&nbsp;V @ 1&nbsp;m.\n\nThe sound pressure output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be equivalent to a measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), under the condition that the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an [[infinite baffle]]. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus \"focusing\" them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.\n\n* Typical home loudspeakers have sensitivities of about 85 to 95&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m\u2014an efficiency of 0.5\u20134%.\n* Sound reinforcement and public address loudspeakers have sensitivities of perhaps 95 to 102&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m\u2014an efficiency of 4\u201310%.\n* Rock concert, stadium PA, marine hailing, etc. speakers generally have higher sensitivities of 103 to 110&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m\u2014an efficiency of 10\u201320%.\n\nA driver with a higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3&nbsp;dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3&nbsp;dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100&nbsp;W driver (\"A\") rated at 92&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200&nbsp;W driver (\"B\") rated at 89&nbsp;dB for 1&nbsp;W @ 1&nbsp;m when both are driven with 100&nbsp;W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100&nbsp;W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or [[loudness]] as speaker B would produce with 200&nbsp;W input. Thus, a 3&nbsp;dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier\u2014and often, to reduced overall system cost.\n\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Hofmann's Iron Law]] -->\n{{anchor|Hofmann}}It is typically not possible to combine high efficiency (especially at low frequencies) with compact enclosure size and adequate low frequency response. One can, for the most part, choose only two of the three parameters when designing a speaker system. So, for example, if extended low-frequency performance and small box size are important, one must accept low efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trueaudio.com/st_trade.htm|title=TA Speaker Topics: Loudspeaker Design Tradeoffs|first=John L.

Most listening rooms present a more or less reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from [[resonant room modes]]), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.\n\nA significant factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.\n\n===Placement===\nIn a typical rectangular listening room, the hard, parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling cause primary [[acoustic resonance]] nodes in each of the three dimensions: left-right, up-down and forward-backward.<ref>\"Acoustics\", Leo Beranek, chapter 10, McGraw Hill Books, 1954</ref> Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving three, four, five and even all six boundary surfaces combining to create [[standing wave]]s. Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium size rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the [[Schroeder frequency]]&nbsp;\u2013 typically around 200\u2013300&nbsp;Hz, depending on room size.\n\n===Directivity===\nAcousticians, in studying the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally, independent of frequency.\n\nAny object radiating sound, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; others are not.\n\nOne simple combination is two simple sources separated by a distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair is known as a doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.\n\n[[File:Bosch 36W column loudspeaker polar pattern.png|thumb|Polar plots of a four-driver industrial columnar [[public address]] loudspeaker taken at six frequencies.

Loudspeaker information was gathered by the manufacturer into a CF2 file.</ref>]]\nIn real life, individual drivers are complex 3D shapes such as cones and domes, and they are placed on a baffle for various reasons. A mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on modeling combinations of point sources, is usually not possible, but in the far field, the directivity of a loudspeaker with a circular diaphragm is close to that of a flat circular piston, so it can be used as an illustrative simplification for discussion. As a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following:\nthe formula for far field directivity of a flat circular piston in an infinite baffle is <small><math>p(\\theta) = \\frac{p_0 J_1(k_a \\sin \\theta)}{k_a \\sin \\theta}</math></small>\nwhere <small><math>k_a=\\frac{2\\pi a}{\\lambda}</math></small>, <small><math>p_0</math></small> is the pressure on axis, <small><math>a</math></small> is the piston radius, <small><math>\\lambda</math></small> is the wavelength (i.e. <small><math>\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f} = \\frac{\\text{speed of sound}}{\\text{frequency}}</math></small>) <small><math>\\theta</math></small> is the angle off axis and <small><math>J_1</math></small> is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind.\n\nA planar source radiates sound uniformly for low frequencies' wavelengths longer than the dimensions of the planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of directivity occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.\n\nVarious manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called [[studio monitor|monitors]], as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose\u2014the 2201. Later [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in [[Bose Corporation#Criticisms|high fidelity circles]], but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.\n\nDirectivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed 'beamy') speaker (i.e., on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a reverberant field lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble even though it measures well on axis (e.g., \"flat\" across the entire frequency range). Speakers with very wide, or rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies, can give the impression that there is too much treble (if the listener is on axis) or too little (if the listener is off axis). This is part of the reason why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.\n\n==Other speaker designs==\n\nWhile dynamic cone speakers remain the most popular choice, many other speaker technologies exist.\n\n===With a diaphragm===\n\n====Moving-iron loudspeakers====\n{{main article|Moving iron speaker}}\n[[image:Moving-iron_cone_speaker_1929.png|thumb|right|200px|Moving iron speaker]]\nThe moving iron speaker was the first type of speaker that was invented. Unlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a stationary coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature).  The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself.  This design was the original loudspeaker design, dating back to the early telephone.  Moving iron drivers are inefficient and can only produce a small band of sound.  They require large magnets and coils to increase force.<ref name=\"moving iron\">{{cite web|title=The Moving-Iron Speaker|url=http://www.vias.org/crowhurstba/crowhurst_basic_audio_vol1_042.html|website=vias.org}}</ref>\n\nBalanced armature drivers (a type of moving iron driver) use an armature that moves like a see-saw or diving board.  Since they are not damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances.  They are still used today for high end [[earphones]] and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.<ref name=\"balanced armature\">{{cite web|last1=Hertsens|first1=Tyll|title=How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work|url=http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work#IboPCt5E0YtmLTAL.97|website=innerfidelity|date=2014-12-16}}</ref>\n\n====Piezoelectric speakers====\n{{main article|Piezoelectric speaker}}\n{{See also|Piezo tweeter}}\n[[File:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|A piezoelectric buzzer. The white ceramic piezoelectric material can be seen fixed to a metal diaphragm.]]\nPiezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in [[watch]]es and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they are resistant to overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, and they can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.\n\nPiezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency output, and this is useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, [[sonar]] applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of [[underwater microphone]]s). They have advantages in these applications, not the least of which is simple and solid state construction that resists seawater better than a ribbon or cone based device would.\n\nIn 2013, [[Kyocera]] introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only 1 millimeter of thickness and 7 grams of weight for their 55\" [[OLED]] televisions and they hope the speakers will also be used in PCs and tablets. Besides medium-size, there are also large and small sizes which can all produce relatively the same quality of sound and volume within 180 degrees. The highly responsive speaker material provides better clarity than traditional TV speakers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/kyocera-piezoelectric-film-speaker/#continued |title=Kyocera piezoelectric film speaker delivers 180-degree sound to thin TVs and tablets (update: live photos) |date=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Magnetostatic loudspeakers====\n{{Main article|Magnetostatic loudspeaker}}\n[[File:Magnepan MG1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Magnetostatic loudspeaker]]\nInstead of a voice coil driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it.  Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.\n\n====Magnetostrictive speakers====\nMagnetostrictive transducers, based on [[magnetostriction]], have been predominantly used as [[sonar]] ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required.

The thickness of the diaphragm and grids has been exaggerated for the purpose of illustration.]]\n[[Electrostatic loudspeaker]]s use a high voltage electric field (rather than a magnetic field) to drive a thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning.  However, their optimum listening area is small and they are not very efficient speakers.  They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations\u2014the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency.  This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.\n\nElectrostatics are inherently dipole radiators and due to the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature, and the bass [[roll-off|rolls off]] at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.\n\nElectrostatics are usually driven through a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage swings produced by the power amplifier.  This transformer also multiplies the capacitive load that is inherent in electrostatic transducers, which means the effective impedance presented to the power amplifiers varies widely by frequency.  A speaker that is nominally 8 ohms may actually present a load of 1 ohm at higher frequencies, which is challenging to some amplifier designs.\n\n====Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers====\nA '''ribbon speaker''' consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little [[mass]]; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile\u2014some can be torn by a strong gust of air. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier \"sees\" a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer turns ratio squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.\n\nPlanar magnetic speakers (having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm) are sometimes described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The [[Laplace force|current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field]] of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.\n\n====Bending wave loudspeakers====\nBending wave transducers use a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity of the material increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach the edge of the speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80&nbsp;Hz to 35,000&nbsp;Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source.<ref>[http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/687ohm/ Stereophile magazine. ''Ohm Walsh 5 loudspeaker'' (review by Dick Olsher, June 1987)]</ref> This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.\n\nThe Ohm Walsh loudspeakers use a unique driver designed by [[Lincoln Walsh]], who had been a radar development engineer in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back-and-forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a \"transmission line\". The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then.  German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.\n\nThe German firm, Manger, has designed and produced a bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional. In fact, the round panel attached to the voice coil bends in a carefully controlled way to produce full range sound.<ref>Manger, Josef W. [http://issuu.com/manger-msw/docs/acoustical_reality-1-?mode=window&viewMode=singlePage \"Acoustical Reality\"].</ref> Josef W. Manger was awarded with the \"Diesel Medal\" for extraordinary developments and inventions by the German institute of inventions.\n\n====Flat panel loudspeakers====\nThere have been many attempts to reduce the size of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of \"exciter\" transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. Some progress has been made using such lightweight, rigid, materials such as [[Styrofoam]], and there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.desireeasy.com/2018/11/abuzhen-mini-portable-wireless.html|title=Abuzhen Mini Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker|website=www.desireeasy.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206102224/https://www.desireeasy.com/2018/11/abuzhen-mini-portable-wireless.html|archive-date=6 December 2018|url-status=dead}}{{dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Heil air motion transducers====\n{{Main article|Air Motion Transformer}}\n[[Image:AirMotionTransformer.png|right|thumb|300px|In Heil's air motion transducer, current through the membrane 2 causes it to move left and right in magnetic field 6, moving air in and out along directions 8; barriers 4 prevent air from moving in unintended directions.]]\n[[Oskar Heil]] invented the air motion transducer in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in a magnetic field and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats in accordance with the imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic tweeter designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Lafayette Radio]], a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany\u2014one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.\n\n====Transparent ionic conduction speaker====\nIn 2013, a research team introduced Transparent ionic conduction speaker which a 2 layers transparent conductive gel and a layer of transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality. The speaker is suitable for robotics, mobile computing and adaptive optics fields.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/30/transparent-gel-speaker-ionic-conduction/#continued |title=Transparent gel speaker plays music through the magic of ionic conduction (video) |date=August 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Without a diaphragm===\n\n====Plasma arc speakers====\n{{Main article|Plasma speaker}}\n[[File:Moeller Plasma.jpg|thumb|Plasma speaker]]\n[[Plasma arc loudspeaker]]s use electrical [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but is charged and therefore can be manipulated by an [[electric field]], the result is a very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the [[Plasmatronics]] Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from [[helium]] gas.<ref name=nutshellhifi>[http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/speaker-design1.html Hill Plasmatronics] described. Retrieved March 26, 2007.</ref> This avoided the [[ozone]] and [[nitrous oxide]]<ref name=nutshellhifi/> produced by [[Radio frequency|RF]] decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.\n\nA less expensive variation on this theme is the use of a flame for the driver, as flames contain ionized (electrically charged) gases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/feb98/888372043.Ot.r.html|title=Re: COULD YOU PLEASE FIND RESEARCH RE:SOUND REPRODUTION VIA GAS FLAME & ELECTRI|author=|date=|website=www.madsci.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n====Thermoacoustic speakers====\nIn 2008, researchers of Tsinghua University demonstrated a thermoacoustic loudspeaker of [[carbon nanotube]] thin film,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Lin|author2=Kaili Jiang |title=Flexible, Stretchable, Transparent Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Loudspeakers|journal=Nano Letters|year=2008|volume=8|issue=12|pages=4539\u20134545|doi=10.1021/nl802750z|pmid=19367976}}</ref>  whose working mechanism is a thermoacoustic effect.

Rotary woofers are able to efficiently reproduce [[infrasound]] frequencies, which are difficult to impossible to achieve on a traditional speaker with a diaphragm.  They are often employed in movie theaters to recreate rumbling bass effects, such as explosions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iar-80.com/page142.html|title=Eminent Technology TRW-17 Subwoofer Part I: The Only Subwoofer|website=International Audio/Video Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Guttenberg|first1=Steve|title=World's most amazing subwoofer has no woofer|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-most-amazing-subwoofer-has-no-woofer/|website=Cnet}}</ref>\n\n===New technologies ===\n\n====Digital speakers====\n{{Main article|Digital speaker}}\n\n[[Digital speakers]] have been the subject of experiments performed by [[Bell Labs]] as far back as the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The design is simple; each [[bit]] controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent [[analog digital conversion]] problems, the effect of [[aliasing]] is unavoidable, so that the audio output is \"reflected\" at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the [[Nyquist limit]] (half the sampling frequency), causing an unacceptably high level of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]s to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.\n\nThe term \"digital\" or \"digital-ready\" is often used for marketing purposes on speakers or [[headphones]], but these systems are not digital in the sense described above. Rather, they are conventional speakers that can be used with digital sound sources (e.g., [[optical media]], [[MP3]] players, etc.), as can any conventional speaker.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Association of Loudspeaker Manufacturing & Acoustics International]] (ALMA)\n*[[Audio power]]\n*[[Audiophile]]\n*[[Bandwidth extension]]\n*[[Directional sound]]\n*[[Dust cap]]\n*[[Echo cancellation]]\n*[[Electronics]]\n*[[Ferrofluid#Heat transfer]]\n*[[Guitar speaker]]\n*[[Headphones]]\n*[[High-end audio]]\n*[[Isobaric loudspeaker]]\n*[[List of loudspeaker manufacturers]]\n*[[Loudspeaker acoustics]]\n*[[Long Range Acoustic Device]](LRAD)\n*[[Music centre]]\n*[[Parabolic loudspeaker]]\n*[[Phase plug]]\n*[[Planephones]]\n*[[Rotary woofer]]\n*[[Sound]]\n*[[Sound from ultrasound]]\n*[[Soundbar]]\n*[[Speaker driver]]\n*[[Speaker stands]]\n*[[Speaker wire]]\n*[[Speakerphone]]\n*[[Studio monitor]]\n*[[Super tweeter]]\n*[[Surround sound]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Loudspeaker|Loudspeakers}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.almainternational.org/ ALMA&nbsp;\u2013 A Forum for the Global Loudspeaker Industry]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-efficiency.htm Conversion of sensitivity to energy efficiency in percent for passive loudspeakers]\n*[https://www.sps.tue.nl/rmaarts/RMA_papers/aar06pu1.pdf Article on sensitivity and efficiency of loudspeakers]\n*[http://www.lenardaudio.com/education/05_speakers.html Speaker Principles Illustrated guide to loudspeaker design and practice]\n\n{{Music technology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Loudspeakers| ]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1924]]\n[[Category:Audio engineering]]\n[[Category:Music technology]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n", "name_user": "72", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:rm stray content -- extended caption was not removed with image inSpecial:Diff/947155277", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker"}

In addition, because of past [[Dawes Act|land allotments]], leading to some sales to non\u2013Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of [[tribal]], [[individual]], and privately held land being a separate [[enclave]]. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political, and legal difficulties.<ref>Sutton, 199.</ref>\n\nThe collective geographical area of all reservations is {{convert|56,200,000|acre|ha sqmi sqkm|lk=on}},<ref name=\"Department of the Interior\"/> approximately the size of [[Idaho]]. While most reservations are small compared to U.S. states, there are 12 Indian reservations larger than the state of [[Rhode Island]]. The largest reservation, the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo Nation Reservation]], is similar in size to [[West Virginia]]. Reservations are unevenly distributed throughout the country; the majority are west of the Mississippi River and occupy lands that were first reserved by [[treaty]] or \"[[Indian Land Grants|granted]]\" from the public domain.<ref>Kinney, 1937; Sutton, 1975</ref>\n\nBecause tribes possess the concept of [[tribal sovereignty]], even though it is limited, laws on tribal lands vary from those of the surrounding area.<ref>Davies & Clow; Sutton 1991.</ref> These laws can permit legal [[Native American gambling enterprises|casinos]] on reservations, for example, which attract [[tourism|tourists]]. The tribal council, not the local government or the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]], often has jurisdiction over reservations. Different reservations have different systems of government, which may or may not replicate the forms of government found outside the reservation. Most Native American reservations were established by the federal government; a limited number, mainly in the East, owe their origin to state recognition.<ref>For general data, see Tiller (1996).</ref>\n\nThe name \"reservation\" comes from the conception of the Native American tribes as independent sovereigns at the time the U.S. Constitution was ratified.  Thus, the early peace treaties (often signed under [[duress]]) in which Native American tribes surrendered large portions of land to the U.S. also designated parcels which the tribes, as sovereigns, \"[[Reservation (law)|reserved]]\" to themselves, and those parcels came to be called \"reservations\".<ref>See, e.g., ''United States v. Dion'', {{ussc|476|734|1986}}; ''Francis v. Francis'', {{ussc|203|233|1906}}.</ref>  The term remained in use even after the federal government began to forcibly relocate tribes to parcels of land to which they had no historical connection.\n\nToday a majority of Native Americans and [[Alaska Natives]] live somewhere other than the reservations, often in larger western cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/housing_patterns/pdftoc.html |title=Racial and Ethnic Residential Segregation in the United States: 1980\u20132000 |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>For Los Angeles, see Allen, J.

Some of the lands these tribes were given to inhabit following the removals eventually became Indian reservations.\n\nIn 1851, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] which authorized the creation of Indian reservations in modern-day [[Oklahoma]]. Relations between settlers and natives had grown increasingly worse as the settlers encroached on territory and natural resources in the West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Elmer|title=Federal Indian Law|year=2008|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|isbn= 9781584777762|pages=201\u2013203}}</ref>\n\n===Forced assimilation (1868\u20131887)===\n[[File:New-mexico-rez.jpg|thumb|Most Indian reservations, like the [[Laguna Indian Reservation, New Mexico|Laguna Indian reservation]] in New Mexico (pictured here in 1943), are in the western United States, often in regions suitable more for ranching than farming.]]\nIn 1868, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] pursued a \"Peace Policy\" as an attempt to avoid violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/342.html|title=President Grant advances \"Peace Policy\" with tribes|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> The policy included a reorganization of the Indian Service, with the goal of relocating various tribes from their ancestral homes to parcels of lands established specifically for their inhabitation. The policy called for the replacement of government officials by religious men, nominated by churches, to oversee the Indian agencies on reservations in order to teach [[Christianity]] to the native tribes. The [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] were especially active in this policy on reservations.<ref>[http://millercenter.org/president/grant/essays/biography/4?ModPagespeed=noscript Miller Center, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211757/http://millercenter.org/president/grant/essays/biography/4?ModPagespeed=noscript |date=8 April 2014 }}, Retrieved 7 April 2014.</ref>\n\nThe policy was controversial from the start. Reservations were generally established by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]. In many cases, white settlers objected to the size of land parcels, which were subsequently reduced. A report submitted to Congress in 1868 found widespread corruption among the federal Native American agencies and generally poor conditions among the relocated tribes.\n\nMany tribes ignored the relocation orders at first and were forced onto their limited land parcels. Enforcement of the policy required the [[United States Army]] to restrict the movements of various tribes. The pursuit of tribes in order to force them back onto reservations led to a number of wars with Native Americans which included some massacres. The most well-known conflict was the [[Sioux War]] on the northern [[Great Plains]], between 1876 and 1881, which included the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]]. Other famous wars in this regard included the [[Nez Perce War]].\n\nBy the late 1870s, the policy established by President Grant was regarded as a failure, primarily because it had resulted in some of the bloodiest wars between Native Americans and the United States. By 1877, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] began phasing out the policy, and by 1882 all religious organizations had relinquished their authority to the federal Indian agency.\n\n===Individualized reservations (1887\u20131934)===\nIn 1887, Congress undertook a significant change in reservation policy by the passage of the [[Dawes Act]], or General Allotment (Severalty) Act. The act ended the general policy of granting land parcels to tribes as-a-whole by granting small parcels of land to individual tribe members. In some cases, for example, the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]], after the individual parcels were granted out of reservation land, the reservation area was reduced by giving the \"excess land\" to white settlers. The individual allotment policy continued until 1934 when it was terminated by the [[Indian Reorganization Act]].\n\n===Indian New Deal (1934\u2013present)===\nThe [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, also known as the ''Howard-Wheeler Act'', was sometimes called the ''Indian New Deal'' and was initiated by [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]]. It laid out new rights for Native Americans, reversed some of the earlier privatization of their common holdings, and encouraged [[tribal sovereignty]] and land management by tribes. The act slowed the assignment of tribal lands to individual members and reduced the assignment of \"extra\" holdings to nonmembers.\n\nFor the following 20 years, the U.S. government invested in infrastructure, health care, and education on the reservations. Likewise, over two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land were returned to various tribes. Within a decade of Collier's retirement the government's position began to swing in the opposite direction. The new Indian Commissioners Myers and Emmons introduced the idea of the \"withdrawal program\" or \"[[Indian termination policy|termination]]\", which sought to end the government's responsibility and involvement with Indians and to force their assimilation.\n\nThe Indians would lose their lands but were to be compensated, although many were not. Even though discontent and social rejection killed the idea before it was fully implemented, five tribes were terminated\u2014the [[Coushatta]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah|Paiute]], [[Menominee]] and [[Klamath people|Klamath]]\u2014and 114 groups in California lost their federal recognition as tribes. Many individuals were also relocated to cities, but one-third returned to their tribal reservations in the decades that followed.\n\n==Land tenure and federal Indian law==\nWith the establishment of reservations, tribal territories diminished to a fraction of original areas and indigenous customary practices of land tenure sustained only for a time, and not in every instance. Instead, the federal government established regulations that subordinated tribes to the authority, first, of the military, and then of the Bureau (Office) of Indian Affairs.<ref>Kinney 1937</ref> Under federal law, the government patented reservations to tribes, which became legal entities that at later times have operated in a corporate manner. [[Tribal tenure]] identifies jurisdiction over [[land-use planning]] and zoning, negotiating (with the close participation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) leases for timber harvesting and mining.<ref name=\"Tiller 1996\">Tiller (1996)</ref>\n\nTribes generally have authority over other forms of economic development such as ranching, agriculture, tourism, and casinos.  Tribes hire both members, other Indians and non-Indians in varying capacities; they may run tribal stores, gas stations, and develop museums (e.g., there is a gas station and general store at Fort Hall Indian Reservation, [[Idaho]], and a museum at Foxwoods, on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation in [[Connecticut]]).<ref name=\"Tiller 1996\"/>\n\nTribal members may utilize a number of resources held in tribal tenures such as grazing range and some cultivable lands. They may also construct homes on tribally held lands. As such, members are [[tenants-in-common]], which may be likened to communal tenure. Even if some of this pattern emanates from pre-reservation tribal custom, generally the tribe has the authority to modify tenant in-common practices.\n\n[[File:Wagon loaded with squash - NARA - 285663.jpg|thumb|left|Wagon loaded with squash, [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], ca. 1936]]\nWith the [[Dawes Act|General Allotment Act (Dawes)]], 1887, the government sought to individualize tribal lands by authorizing allotments held in [[individual tenure]].<ref>Getches et al, pp. 140\u2013190.</ref>  Generally, the allocation process led to grouping family holdings and, in some cases, this sustained pre-reservation clan or other patterns.  There had been a few allotment programs ahead of the Dawes Act. However, the vast fragmentation of reservations occurred from the enactment of this act up to 1934, when the Indian Reorganization Act was passed.  However, Congress authorized some allotment programs in the ensuing years, such as on the Palm Springs/Agua Caliente Indian Reservation in California.<ref>The Equalization Act, 1959.</ref>\n\nAllotment set in motion a number of circumstances: \n* individuals could sell (alienate) the allotment \u2013 under the Dawes Act, it was not to happen until after twenty-five years.\n* individual allottees who would die intestate would encumber the land under prevailing state devisement laws, leading to complex patterns of heirship.  Congress has attempted to mollify the impact of heirship by granting tribes the capacity to acquire fragmented allotments owing to heirship by financial grants.  Tribes may also include such parcels in long-range land use planning.\n* With alienation to non-Indians, their increased presence on numerous reservations has changed the demography of Indian Country.  One of many implications of this fact is that tribes can not always effectively embrace the total management of a reservation, for non-Indian owners and users of allotted lands contend that tribes have no authority over lands that fall within the tax and law-and-order  jurisdiction of local government.<ref>Sutton, ed., 1991.</ref>\n\nThe demographic factor, coupled with landownership data, led, for example, to litigation between the Devils Lake Sioux and the State of North Dakota, where non-Indians owned more acreage than tribal members even though more Native Americans resided on the reservation than non-Indians. The court decision turned, in part, on the perception of ''Indian character'', contending that the tribe did not have jurisdiction over the alienated allotments. In a number of instances\u2014e.g., the Yakama Indian Reservation\u2014tribes have identified ''open'' and ''closed'' areas within reservations.  One finds the majority of non-Indian landownership and residence in the open areas and, contrariwise, closed areas represent exclusive tribal residence and related conditions.<ref>Wishart and Froehling</ref>\n\n[[File:SPRING ROUNDUP OF PAIUTE-OWNED CATTLE BEGINS AT SUTCLIFFE PYRAMID LAKE INDIAN RESERVATION. CORALLING AND BRANDING IS... - NARA - 553104 color corrected.tif|thumb|right|Spring roundup of [[Paiute people|Paiute]]-owned cattle begins at [[Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation]], 1973.]]\n[[Indian Country]] today consists of tripartite government\u2014i. e., federal, state and/or local, and tribal.  Where state and local governments may exert some, but limited, law-and-order authority, tribal sovereignty is diminished.  This situation prevails in connection with Indian gaming because federal legislation makes the state a party to any contractual or [[statutory]] agreement.<ref>Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 1988</ref>\n\nFinally, other-occupancy on reservations may be by virtue of tribal or individual tenure. There are many churches on reservations; most would occupy tribal land by consent of the federal government or the tribe.  BIA agency offices, hospitals, schools, and other facilities usually occupy residual federal parcels within reservations. Many reservations include one or more sections (about 640 acres) of school lands, but those lands typically remain part of the reservation (e.g., Enabling Act of 1910 at Section 20<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/const/enabling.pdf|title=Enabling Act of 1910|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>).  As a general practice, such lands may sit idle or be grazed by tribal ranchers.\n\n==Disputes over land sovereignty==\n\nWhen the Europeans discovered the \"New World\" in the fifteenth century, the land that was new to them had been home to Native Peoples for thousands of years. The American colonial government determined a precedent of establishing the land sovereignty of North America through treaties between countries. This precedent was upheld by the United States government. As a result, most Native American land was \"purchased\" by the United States government, a portion of which was designated to remain under Native sovereignty. The United States government and Native Peoples do not always agree on how land should be governed, which has resulted in a series of disputes over sovereignty.\n\n=== Black Hills land dispute ===\n{{Main|Black Hills Land Claim}}\nThe Federal Government and [[Lakota people|The Lakota Sioux]] tribe members have been involved in sorting out a legal claim for the [[Black Hills]] since signing the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lenane|first=Rita|date=2015|title=It Doesn't Seem Very Fair, Because We Were Here First: Resolving the Sioux Nation Black Hills Land Dispute and the Potential for Restorative Justice to Facilitate Government-to-Government Negotiations|url=https://cardozojcr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lenane_It-Doesnt-Seem-Very-Fair.pdf|journal=Cardozo Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=16.2|pages=651-683}}</ref> which created what is known today as the Great Sioux Nation covering the Black Hills and nearly half of western South Dakota.<ref name=\":0\" /> This treaty was acknowledged and respected until 1874, when General George Custer discovered gold,<ref name=\":0\" /> sending a wave of settlers into the area and leading to the realization of the value of the land from United States President Grant.<ref name=\":0\" /> President Grant used tactical military force to remove the Sioux from the land and assisted in the development of the Congressional appropriations bill for Indian Services in 1876, a \"starve or sell\" treaty signed by only 10% of the 75% tribal men required based on specifications from the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty]]  that relinquished the Sioux's rights to the Black Hills.<ref name=\":0\" /> Following this treaty, the Agreement of 1877 was passed by Congress to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills, stating that the land was purchased from the Sioux despite the insufficient number of signatures,<ref name=\":0\" /> the lack of transaction records, and the tribe's claim that the land was never for sale.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=dd3bd5c2-cabf-413e-8c63-c08f67a1d94b@sessionmgr4008&vid=0&hid=4108&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=edsgcl.285460966&db=edsglr|title=Saying no to $1 billion: why the impoverished Sioux nation won't take feder...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux as a place central to their spirituality and identity,<ref name=\":0\" /> and contest of ownership of the land has been pressured in the courts by the Sioux Nation since they were allowed legal avenue in 1920.<ref name=\":0\" /> Beginning in 1923, the Sioux made legal claim that their relinquishment from the Black Hills was illegal under the Fifth Amendment, and no amount of money can make up for the loss of their sacred land.<ref name=\":0\" /> This claim went all the way up to the Supreme Court ''[[United States v.

The Hopi reservation is 2,531.773 square miles within Arizona and lies surrounded by the greater Navajo reservation which spans 27,413 square miles and extends slightly into the states of New Mexico and Utah. The Hopi, also known as the Pueblo people, made many spiritually motivated migrations throughout the Southwest before settling in present-day Northern Arizona.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dongoske|first=Kurt E.|date=1 January 1996|title=The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act: A New Beginning, Not the End, for Osteological Analysis\u2014A Hopi Perspective|jstor=1185706|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=20|issue=2|pages=287\u2013296|doi=10.2307/1185706}}</ref> The Navajo people also migrated throughout western North America following spiritual commands before settling near the Grand Canyon area. The two tribes peacefully coexisted and even traded and exchanged ideas with each other; However, their way of lives were threatened when the \"New people\", what the Navajo called white settlers,<ref>DeAngelis, T. (2004). The Navajo: Weavers of the Southwest. Mankato, MN: Blue Earth Books.</ref> began executing Natives across the continent and claiming their land, as a result of Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act. War ensued between the Navajo people, who call themselves the Din\u00e9, and new Americans. The end result was the Long Walk in the early 1860s in which the entire tribe was forced to walk roughly 400 miles from Fort Canby (present day Window Rock, Arizona) to Bosque Redondo in New Mexico. This march is similar to the well known Cherokee \"Trail of Tears\" and like it, many of the tribe did not survive the trek. The roughly 11,000 tribe members were imprisoned here in what the United States government deemed an experimental Indian reservation that failed because it became too expensive, there were too many people to feed, and they were continuously raided by other native tribes.<ref>Reidhead, S. (2001). Wild West.</ref> Consequently, in 1868, the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland after signing the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]]. The treaty officially established the \"Navajo Indian Reservation\" in Northern Arizona. The term reservation is one which creates territorialities or claims on places. This treaty gave them the right to the land and semi-autonomous governance of it. The Hopi reservation, on the other hand, was created through an executive order by President Arthur in 1882.\n\nA few years after the two reservations were established, the Dawes Allotment Act was passed under which communal tribal land was divvied up and allocated to each household in attempt to enforce European-American farming styles where each family owns and works their own plot of land. This was a further act of enclosure by the US government. Each family received 640 acres or less and the remaining land was deemed \"surplus\" because it was more than the tribes needed. This \"surplus\" land was then made available for purchase by American citizens.\n\nThe land designated to the Navajo and Hopi reservation was originally considered barren and unproductive by white settlers until 1921 when prospectors scoured the land for oil. The mining companies pressured the US government to set up Native American councils on the reservations so that they could agree to contracts, specifically leases, in the name of the tribe.<ref>Mudd, V.

Some people had even built their houses out of mine waste. The companies also failed to properly dispose of the radioactive waste which did and will continue to pollute the environment, including the natives' water sources. Many years later, these same men who worked the mines died from lung cancer and their families received no form of financial compensation.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Church Rock uranium mill spill]] was the largest release of radioactive waste in US history. The spill contaminated the Puerco River with 1,000 tons of solid radioactive waste and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution which flowed downstream into the Navajo Nation. The Navajos used the water from this river for irrigation and their livestock but were not immediately informed about the contamination and its danger.<ref>Pasternak, J. (2010). Yellow dirt: An American story of a poisoned land and a people betrayed. New York, NY: Free Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, the American population boomed and energy demands soared. The utility companies needed a new source of power so they began the construction of coal-fired power plants. They placed these power plants in the four corners region. In the 1960s, John Boyden, an attorney working for both Peabody Coal and the Hopi tribe, the nation's largest coal producer,  managed to gain rights to the Hopi land, including Black Mesa, a sacred location to both tribes which lay partially within the Joint Use Area of both tribes.\n\n{{npov|date=December 2019}}This case is an example of environmental racism and injustice, per the principles established by the Participants of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Environmental Justice|journal = Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume = 34|pages = 405\u2013430|last=Mohai|first=Paul|last2=Pellow|first2=David|date=15 October 2009|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348|last3=Roberts|first3=J.

At the same time, Hopi and Navajo tribes were squabbling over land rights while Navajo livestock continuously grazed on Hopi land. Boyden took advantage of this situation, presenting it to the House Subcommittee on Indian Affairs claiming that if the government did not step in and do something, a bloody war would ensue between the tribes. Congressmen agreed to pass the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 which forced any Hopi and Navajo people living on the other's land to relocate. This affected 6,000 Navajo people and ultimately benefitted coal companies the most who could now more easily access the disputed land. Instead of using military violence to deal with those who refused to move, the government passed what became known as the Bennett Freeze to encourage the people to leave. The Bennett Freeze banned 1.5 million acres of Navajo land from any type of development, including paving roadways and even roof repair. This was meant to be a temporary incentive to push tribe negotiations but lasted over forty years until 2009 when President Obama lifted the moratorium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://congress.gov/|title=Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|website=congress.gov|language=en|access-date=6 April 2017}}</ref> Still, the legacy of the Bennett Freeze looms over the region as seen by the nearly third world conditions on the reservation \u2013 seventy-five per cent of people do not have access to electricity and housing situations are poor.\n\n==Life and culture==\n{{See also|Modern social statistics of Native Americans}}\n{{Native American topics sidebar}}\n[[File:Bayfield county IMG 1612 red cliff wisconsin 34th powwow.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Cliff Indian Reservation]] in Wisconsin during their annual [[pow wow]]]]\nMany Native Americans who live on reservations deal with the federal government through two agencies: the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the [[Indian Health Service]].\n\nThe standard of living on some reservations is comparable to that in the [[developing world]], with issues of infant mortality,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/american-indian-health.htm|title=FastStats|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=24 April 2017}}</ref> life expectancy, poor nutrition, poverty, and alcohol and drug abuse.

The state attempted to close the operation down but was stopped in the courts. In the 1980s, the case of ''[[California v. Cabazon Band|California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]]'' established the right of reservations to operate other forms of gambling operations. In 1988, Congress passed the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which recognized the right of Native American tribes to establish gambling and gaming facilities on their reservations as long as the states in which they are located have some form of legalized gambling.\n\nToday, many Native American casinos are used as [[tourism|tourist]] attractions, including as the basis for hotel and conference facilities, to draw visitors and revenue to reservations.

Some of the lands these tribes were given to inhabit following the removals eventually became Indian reservations.\n\nIn 1851, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] which authorized the creation of Indian reservations in modern-day [[Oklahoma]]. Relations between settlers and natives had grown increasingly worse as the settlers encroached on territory and natural resources in the West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Elmer|title=Federal Indian Law|year=2008|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|isbn= 9781584777762|pages=201\u2013203}}</ref>\n\n===Forced assimilation (1868\u20131887)===\n[[File:New-mexico-rez.jpg|thumb|Most Indian reservations, like the [[Laguna Indian Reservation, New Mexico|Laguna Indian reservation]] in New Mexico (pictured here in 1943), are in the western United States, often in regions suitable more for ranching than farming.]]\nIn 1868, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] pursued a \"Peace Policy\" as an attempt to avoid violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/342.html|title=President Grant advances \"Peace Policy\" with tribes|publisher=US National Library of Medicine|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> The policy included a reorganization of the Indian Service, with the goal of relocating various tribes from their ancestral homes to parcels of lands established specifically for their inhabitation. The policy called for the replacement of government officials by religious men, nominated by churches, to oversee the Indian agencies on reservations in order to teach [[Christianity]] to the native tribes. The [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] were especially active in this policy on reservations.<ref>[http://millercenter.org/president/grant/essays/biography/4?ModPagespeed=noscript Miller Center, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211757/http://millercenter.org/president/grant/essays/biography/4?ModPagespeed=noscript |date=8 April 2014 }}, Retrieved 7 April 2014.</ref>\n\nThe policy was controversial from the start. Reservations were generally established by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]. In many cases, white settlers objected to the size of land parcels, which were subsequently reduced. A report submitted to Congress in 1868 found widespread corruption among the federal Native American agencies and generally poor conditions among the relocated tribes.\n\nMany tribes ignored the relocation orders at first and were forced onto their limited land parcels. Enforcement of the policy required the [[United States Army]] to restrict the movements of various tribes. The pursuit of tribes in order to force them back onto reservations led to a number of wars with Native Americans which included some massacres. The most well-known conflict was the [[Sioux War]] on the northern [[Great Plains]], between 1876 and 1881, which included the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]]. Other famous wars in this regard included the [[Nez Perce War]].\n\nBy the late 1870s, the policy established by President Grant was regarded as a failure, primarily because it had resulted in some of the bloodiest wars between Native Americans and the United States. By 1877, President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] began phasing out the policy, and by 1882 all religious organizations had relinquished their authority to the federal Indian agency.\n\n===Individualized reservations (1887\u20131934)===\nIn 1887, Congress undertook a significant change in reservation policy by the passage of the [[Dawes Act]], or General Allotment (Severalty) Act. The act ended the general policy of granting land parcels to tribes as-a-whole by granting small parcels of land to individual tribe members. In some cases, for example, the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation]], after the individual parcels were granted out of reservation land, the reservation area was reduced by giving the \"excess land\" to white settlers. The individual allotment policy continued until 1934 when it was terminated by the [[Indian Reorganization Act]].\n\n===Indian New Deal (1934\u2013present)===\nThe [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, also known as the ''Howard-Wheeler Act'', was sometimes called the ''Indian New Deal'' and was initiated by [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]]. It laid out new rights for Native Americans, reversed some of the earlier privatization of their common holdings, and encouraged [[tribal sovereignty]] and land management by tribes. The act slowed the assignment of tribal lands to individual members and reduced the assignment of \"extra\" holdings to nonmembers.\n\nFor the following 20 years, the U.S. government invested in infrastructure, health care, and education on the reservations. Likewise, over two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land were returned to various tribes. Within a decade of Collier's retirement the government's position began to swing in the opposite direction. The new Indian Commissioners Myers and Emmons introduced the idea of the \"withdrawal program\" or \"[[Indian termination policy|termination]]\", which sought to end the government's responsibility and involvement with Indians and to force their assimilation.\n\nThe Indians would lose their lands but were to be compensated, although many were not. Even though discontent and social rejection killed the idea before it was fully implemented, five tribes were terminated\u2014the [[Coushatta]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah|Paiute]], [[Menominee]] and [[Klamath people|Klamath]]\u2014and 114 groups in California lost their federal recognition as tribes. Many individuals were also relocated to cities, but one-third returned to their tribal reservations in the decades that followed.\n\n==Land tenure and federal Indian law==\nWith the establishment of reservations, tribal territories diminished to a fraction of original areas and indigenous customary practices of land tenure sustained only for a time, and not in every instance. Instead, the federal government established regulations that subordinated tribes to the authority, first, of the military, and then of the Bureau (Office) of Indian Affairs.<ref>Kinney 1937</ref> Under federal law, the government patented reservations to tribes, which became legal entities that at later times have operated in a corporate manner. [[Tribal tenure]] identifies jurisdiction over [[land-use planning]] and zoning, negotiating (with the close participation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) leases for timber harvesting and mining.<ref name=\"Tiller 1996\">Tiller (1996)</ref>\n\nTribes generally have authority over other forms of economic development such as ranching, agriculture, tourism, and casinos.  Tribes hire both members, other Indians and non-Indians in varying capacities; they may run tribal stores, gas stations, and develop museums (e.g., there is a gas station and general store at Fort Hall Indian Reservation, [[Idaho]], and a museum at Foxwoods, on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation in [[Connecticut]]).<ref name=\"Tiller 1996\"/>\n\nTribal members may utilize a number of resources held in tribal tenures such as grazing range and some cultivable lands. They may also construct homes on tribally held lands. As such, members are [[tenants-in-common]], which may be likened to communal tenure. Even if some of this pattern emanates from pre-reservation tribal custom, generally the tribe has the authority to modify tenant in-common practices.\n\n[[File:Wagon loaded with squash - NARA - 285663.jpg|thumb|left|Wagon loaded with squash, [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], ca. 1936]]\nWith the [[Dawes Act|General Allotment Act (Dawes)]], 1887, the government sought to individualize tribal lands by authorizing allotments held in [[individual tenure]].<ref>Getches et al, pp. 140\u2013190.</ref>  Generally, the allocation process led to grouping family holdings and, in some cases, this sustained pre-reservation clan or other patterns.  There had been a few allotment programs ahead of the Dawes Act. However, the vast fragmentation of reservations occurred from the enactment of this act up to 1934, when the Indian Reorganization Act was passed.  However, Congress authorized some allotment programs in the ensuing years, such as on the Palm Springs/Agua Caliente Indian Reservation in California.<ref>The Equalization Act, 1959.</ref>\n\nAllotment set in motion a number of circumstances: \n* individuals could sell (alienate) the allotment \u2013 under the Dawes Act, it was not to happen until after twenty-five years.\n* individual allottees who would die intestate would encumber the land under prevailing state devisement laws, leading to complex patterns of heirship.  Congress has attempted to mollify the impact of heirship by granting tribes the capacity to acquire fragmented allotments owing to heirship by financial grants.  Tribes may also include such parcels in long-range land use planning.\n* With alienation to non-Indians, their increased presence on numerous reservations has changed the demography of Indian Country.  One of many implications of this fact is that tribes can not always effectively embrace the total management of a reservation, for non-Indian owners and users of allotted lands contend that tribes have no authority over lands that fall within the tax and law-and-order  jurisdiction of local government.<ref>Sutton, ed., 1991.</ref>\n\nThe demographic factor, coupled with landownership data, led, for example, to litigation between the Devils Lake Sioux and the State of North Dakota, where non-Indians owned more acreage than tribal members even though more Native Americans resided on the reservation than non-Indians. The court decision turned, in part, on the perception of ''Indian character'', contending that the tribe did not have jurisdiction over the alienated allotments. In a number of instances\u2014e.g., the Yakama Indian Reservation\u2014tribes have identified ''open'' and ''closed'' areas within reservations.  One finds the majority of non-Indian landownership and residence in the open areas and, contrariwise, closed areas represent exclusive tribal residence and related conditions.<ref>Wishart and Froehling</ref>\n\n[[File:SPRING ROUNDUP OF PAIUTE-OWNED CATTLE BEGINS AT SUTCLIFFE PYRAMID LAKE INDIAN RESERVATION. CORALLING AND BRANDING IS... - NARA - 553104 color corrected.tif|thumb|right|Spring roundup of [[Paiute people|Paiute]]-owned cattle begins at [[Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation]], 1973.]]\n[[Indian Country]] today consists of tripartite government\u2014i. e., federal, state and/or local, and tribal.  Where state and local governments may exert some, but limited, law-and-order authority, tribal sovereignty is diminished.  This situation prevails in connection with Indian gaming because federal legislation makes the state a party to any contractual or [[statutory]] agreement.<ref>Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 1988</ref>\n\nFinally, other-occupancy on reservations may be by virtue of tribal or individual tenure. There are many churches on reservations; most would occupy tribal land by consent of the federal government or the tribe.  BIA agency offices, hospitals, schools, and other facilities usually occupy residual federal parcels within reservations. Many reservations include one or more sections (about 640 acres) of school lands, but those lands typically remain part of the reservation (e.g., Enabling Act of 1910 at Section 20<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/const/enabling.pdf|title=Enabling Act of 1910|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>).  As a general practice, such lands may sit idle or be grazed by tribal ranchers.\n\n==Disputes over land sovereignty==\n\nWhen the Europeans discovered the \"New World\" in the fifteenth century, the land that was new to them had been home to Native Peoples for thousands of years. The American colonial government determined a precedent of establishing the land sovereignty of North America through treaties between countries. This precedent was upheld by the United States government. As a result, most Native American land was \"purchased\" by the United States government, a portion of which was designated to remain under Native sovereignty. The United States government and Native Peoples do not always agree on how land should be governed, which has resulted in a series of disputes over sovereignty.\n\n=== Black Hills land dispute ===\n{{Main|Black Hills Land Claim}}\nThe Federal Government and [[Lakota people|The Lakota Sioux]] tribe members have been involved in sorting out a legal claim for the [[Black Hills]] since signing the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lenane|first=Rita|date=2015|title=It Doesn't Seem Very Fair, Because We Were Here First: Resolving the Sioux Nation Black Hills Land Dispute and the Potential for Restorative Justice to Facilitate Government-to-Government Negotiations|url=https://cardozojcr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lenane_It-Doesnt-Seem-Very-Fair.pdf|journal=Cardozo Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=16.2|pages=651-683}}</ref> which created what is known today as the Great Sioux Nation covering the Black Hills and nearly half of western South Dakota.<ref name=\":0\" /> This treaty was acknowledged and respected until 1874, when General George Custer discovered gold,<ref name=\":0\" /> sending a wave of settlers into the area and leading to the realization of the value of the land from United States President Grant.<ref name=\":0\" /> President Grant used tactical military force to remove the Sioux from the land and assisted in the development of the Congressional appropriations bill for Indian Services in 1876, a \"starve or sell\" treaty signed by only 10% of the 75% tribal men required based on specifications from the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Fort Laramie Treaty]]  that relinquished the Sioux's rights to the Black Hills.<ref name=\":0\" /> Following this treaty, the Agreement of 1877 was passed by Congress to remove the Sioux from the Black Hills, stating that the land was purchased from the Sioux despite the insufficient number of signatures,<ref name=\":0\" /> the lack of transaction records, and the tribe's claim that the land was never for sale.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=dd3bd5c2-cabf-413e-8c63-c08f67a1d94b@sessionmgr4008&vid=0&hid=4108&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=edsgcl.285460966&db=edsglr|title=Saying no to $1 billion: why the impoverished Sioux nation won't take feder...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux as a place central to their spirituality and identity,<ref name=\":0\" /> and contest of ownership of the land has been pressured in the courts by the Sioux Nation since they were allowed legal avenue in 1920.<ref name=\":0\" /> Beginning in 1923, the Sioux made legal claim that their relinquishment from the Black Hills was illegal under the Fifth Amendment, and no amount of money can make up for the loss of their sacred land.<ref name=\":0\" /> This claim went all the way up to the Supreme Court ''[[United States v.

The Hopi reservation is 2,531.773 square miles within Arizona and lies surrounded by the greater Navajo reservation which spans 27,413 square miles and extends slightly into the states of New Mexico and Utah. The Hopi, also known as the Pueblo people, made many spiritually motivated migrations throughout the Southwest before settling in present-day Northern Arizona.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dongoske|first=Kurt E.|date=1 January 1996|title=The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act: A New Beginning, Not the End, for Osteological Analysis\u2014A Hopi Perspective|jstor=1185706|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=20|issue=2|pages=287\u2013296|doi=10.2307/1185706}}</ref> The Navajo people also migrated throughout western North America following spiritual commands before settling near the Grand Canyon area. The two tribes peacefully coexisted and even traded and exchanged ideas with each other; However, their way of lives were threatened when the \"New people\", what the Navajo called white settlers,<ref>DeAngelis, T. (2004). The Navajo: Weavers of the Southwest. Mankato, MN: Blue Earth Books.</ref> began executing Natives across the continent and claiming their land, as a result of Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act. War ensued between the Navajo people, who call themselves the Din\u00e9, and new Americans. The end result was the Long Walk in the early 1860s in which the entire tribe was forced to walk roughly 400 miles from Fort Canby (present day Window Rock, Arizona) to Bosque Redondo in New Mexico. This march is similar to the well known Cherokee \"Trail of Tears\" and like it, many of the tribe did not survive the trek. The roughly 11,000 tribe members were imprisoned here in what the United States government deemed an experimental Indian reservation that failed because it became too expensive, there were too many people to feed, and they were continuously raided by other native tribes.<ref>Reidhead, S. (2001). Wild West.</ref> Consequently, in 1868, the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland after signing the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo]]. The treaty officially established the \"Navajo Indian Reservation\" in Northern Arizona. The term reservation is one which creates territorialities or claims on places. This treaty gave them the right to the land and semi-autonomous governance of it. The Hopi reservation, on the other hand, was created through an executive order by President Arthur in 1882.\n\nA few years after the two reservations were established, the Dawes Allotment Act was passed under which communal tribal land was divvied up and allocated to each household in attempt to enforce European-American farming styles where each family owns and works their own plot of land. This was a further act of enclosure by the US government. Each family received 640 acres or less and the remaining land was deemed \"surplus\" because it was more than the tribes needed. This \"surplus\" land was then made available for purchase by American citizens.\n\nThe land designated to the Navajo and Hopi reservation was originally considered barren and unproductive by white settlers until 1921 when prospectors scoured the land for oil. The mining companies pressured the US government to set up Native American councils on the reservations so that they could agree to contracts, specifically leases, in the name of the tribe.<ref>Mudd, V. (Director). (1985). Broken Rainbow [DVD]. United States: Earthworks Films.</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, uranium was mined from their land as well though the companies and government neglected to inform the people of the dangers of radiation exposure. Some people had even built their houses out of mine waste. The companies also failed to properly dispose of the radioactive waste which did and will continue to pollute the environment, including the natives' water sources. Many years later, these same men who worked the mines died from lung cancer and their families received no form of financial compensation.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Church Rock uranium mill spill]] was the largest release of radioactive waste in US history. The spill contaminated the Puerco River with 1,000 tons of solid radioactive waste and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution which flowed downstream into the Navajo Nation. The Navajos used the water from this river for irrigation and their livestock but were not immediately informed about the contamination and its danger.<ref>Pasternak, J. (2010). Yellow dirt: An American story of a poisoned land and a people betrayed. New York, NY: Free Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, the American population boomed and energy demands soared. The utility companies needed a new source of power so they began the construction of coal-fired power plants. They placed these power plants in the four corners region. In the 1960s, John Boyden, an attorney working for both Peabody Coal and the Hopi tribe, the nation's largest coal producer,  managed to gain rights to the Hopi land, including Black Mesa, a sacred location to both tribes which lay partially within the Joint Use Area of both tribes.\n\n{{npov|date=December 2019}}This case is an example of environmental racism and injustice, per the principles established by the Participants of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Environmental Justice|journal = Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume = 34|pages = 405\u2013430|last=Mohai|first=Paul|last2=Pellow|first2=David|date=15 October 2009|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348|last3=Roberts|first3=J. Timmons}}</ref> because the Navajo and Hopi people, which are communities of color, low income, and political alienation, were disproportionately affected by the proximity and resulting pollution of these power plants which disregard their right to clean air, their land was degraded, and because the related public policies are not based on mutual respect of all people.\n\nThe mining companies wanted more land but the joint ownership of the land made negotiations difficult. At the same time, Hopi and Navajo tribes were squabbling over land rights while Navajo livestock continuously grazed on Hopi land. Boyden took advantage of this situation, presenting it to the House Subcommittee on Indian Affairs claiming that if the government did not step in and do something, a bloody war would ensue between the tribes. Congressmen agreed to pass the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 which forced any Hopi and Navajo people living on the other's land to relocate. This affected 6,000 Navajo people and ultimately benefitted coal companies the most who could now more easily access the disputed land. Instead of using military violence to deal with those who refused to move, the government passed what became known as the Bennett Freeze to encourage the people to leave. The Bennett Freeze banned 1.5 million acres of Navajo land from any type of development, including paving roadways and even roof repair. This was meant to be a temporary incentive to push tribe negotiations but lasted over forty years until 2009 when President Obama lifted the moratorium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://congress.gov/|title=Congress.gov {{!}} Library of Congress|website=congress.gov|language=en|access-date=6 April 2017}}</ref> Still, the legacy of the Bennett Freeze looms over the region as seen by the nearly third world conditions on the reservation \u2013 seventy-five per cent of people do not have access to electricity and housing situations are poor.\n\n==Life and culture==\n{{See also|Modern social statistics of Native Americans}}\n{{Native American topics sidebar}}\n[[File:Bayfield county IMG 1612 red cliff wisconsin 34th powwow.JPG|thumb|left|[[Red Cliff Indian Reservation]] in Wisconsin during their annual [[pow wow]]]]\nMany Native Americans who live on reservations deal with the federal government through two agencies: the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the [[Indian Health Service]].\n\nThe standard of living on some reservations is comparable to that in the [[developing world]], with issues of infant mortality,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/american-indian-health.htm|title=FastStats|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=24 April 2017}}</ref> life expectancy, poor nutrition, poverty, and alcohol and drug abuse.

The state attempted to close the operation down but was stopped in the courts. In the 1980s, the case of ''[[California v. Cabazon Band|California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]]'' established the right of reservations to operate other forms of gambling operations. In 1988, Congress passed the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which recognized the right of Native American tribes to establish gambling and gaming facilities on their reservations as long as the states in which they are located have some form of legalized gambling.\n\nToday, many Native American casinos are used as [[tourism|tourist]] attractions, including as the basis for hotel and conference facilities, to draw visitors and revenue to reservations.

In the [[Modern history|modern era]], it has spread outside of Asia due to the efforts of the [[Tibetan diaspora]].\n\nApart from classical Mahayana Buddhist practices like the [[P\u0101ramit\u0101|six perfections]], Tibetan Buddhism also includes [[Tantra|Tantric]] practices, such as [[deity yoga]] and the [[Six Dharmas of Naropa]].

Senior figures from the three non-Gelukpa Buddhist schools and from the Bonpo have been included in the religious administration, and relations between the different lamas and schools are now on the whole very positive.

''pa\u00f1cam\u0101rga''; Tib. ''lam nga'') which are:<ref>Powers 2007, pp. 93-96</ref>\n\n# The path of accumulation - in which one collects wisdom and merit, generates [[bodhicitta]], cultivates the [[four foundations of mindfulness]] and [[Right effort|right effort (the \"four abandonments\")]].\n# The path of preparation - Is attained when one reaches the union of calm abiding and higher insight meditations (see below) and one becomes familiar with [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|emptiness]]. \n# The path of seeing - one perceives emptiness directly, all thoughts of subject and object are overcome, one becomes an ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|arya]]''.\n# The path of meditation - one removes subtler traces from one's mind and perfects one's understanding. \n# The path of no more learning - which culminates in Buddhahood.\n\nThe schema of the five paths is often elaborated and merged with the concept of the [[Bh\u016bmi (Buddhism)|''bhumis'']] or the bodhisattva levels.\n\n===Lamrim===\n{{Main|Lamrim}}\n''Lamrim'' (\"stages of the path\") is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] schema for presenting the stages of spiritual practice leading to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]]. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of ''lamrim'', presented by different teachers of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools.<ref>The [[Sakya]] school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the ''[[lamdr\u00e9]]''.</ref> However, all versions of the ''lamrim'' are elaborations of [[Atisha|Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th-century root text ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa|A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa'').<ref name=\"thubten\">[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment]</ref>\n\nAtisha's ''lamrim'' system generally divides practitioners into those of ''lesser'', ''middling'' and ''superior'' scopes or attitudes:\n*The lesser person is to focus on the preciousness of human birth as well as contemplation of death and impermanence.\n*The middling person is taught to contemplate [[karma]], [[dukkha]] (suffering) and the benefits of liberation and refuge. \n*The superior scope is said to encompass the four [[Brahmavihara]]s, the [[bodhisattva]] vow, the six [[paramitas]] as well as Tantric practices.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 52-53.</ref>\n\nAlthough ''lamrim'' texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways and with different emphasis depending on the school and tradition it belongs to. [[Gampopa]] and [[Tsongkhapa]] expanded the short root-text of Ati\u015ba into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], [[Buddhist cosmology]] and the practice of [[meditation]] are gradually explained in logical order.\n\n===Vajray\u0101na===\n[[File:Hevajra-Tibetan.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the tantric figures [[Hevajra]] and [[Nairatmya|Nair\u0101tmy\u0101]], Tibet, 18th Century.]]\nTibetan Buddhism is a form of [[Vajray\u0101na]] (''[[Vajra]] vehicle''), \"Secret Mantra\" (Skt. ''guhyamantra'') or Buddhist [[Tantra]], affirming the views espoused in the texts known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]] (dating from around the 7th century CE onwards).<ref name=\"Powers, 2007, p. 250\">Powers, 2007, p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[Tantra]] (Tib. ''rgyud'') generally refers to forms of religious practice which emphasize the use of unique visualizations, ideas, symbols and rituals for inner transformation.<ref name=\"Powers, 2007, p. 250\"/> The Vajrayana is seen by its adherents as the fastest and most powerful vehicle for enlightenment because it contains many skillful means (''[[upaya]]'') and because it takes the effect ([[Buddhahood]] itself, or [[Buddha nature]]) as the path (and hence is sometimes known as the \"effect vehicle\", ''phalayana'').<ref name=\"Powers, 2007, p. 250\"/>\n\nAn important element of Tantric practice are tantric deities and their [[mandala]]s. These deities come in peaceful (''shiwa'') and [[Fierce deities|fierce (''trowo'') forms]].<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 69.</ref>\n\nTantric texts also generally affirm the use of sense pleasures and other [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] in Tantric ritual as a path to enlightenment, as opposed to non-Tantric Buddhism which affirms that one must renounce all sense pleasures.<ref name=\"Kapstein 82\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 82.</ref> These practices are based on the theory of transformation which states that negative or sensual mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. As the [[Hevajra tantra]] states:\n\n<blockquote>Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.<ref>Snellgrove, David. (1987) ''Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors''. pp 125-126.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother element of the Tantras is their use of transgressive practices, such as drinking [[taboo]] substances such as alcohol or [[Karmamudr\u0101|sexual yoga]]. While in many cases these transgressions were interpreted only symbolically, in other cases they are practiced literally.<ref name=\"Kapstein 83\">Kapstein, Matthew T.

[[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101|Shunyata]], the true nature of reality, or the emptiness of [[Svabhava|inherent existence]] (''svabhava'') of all things, is traditionally propounded according to a hierarchical classification of four classical Indian philosophical schools.\n\nWhile the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelug school, is limited to four tenets (Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, Sautr\u0101ntika, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the ''shentong''-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical emptiness of the Gelugpa-school, and the experiential emptiness of the Nyingma and the Sakya.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}\n\nTwo tenets belong to the path referred to as the [[Hinayana]], and are both [[Sarvastivada]]-subschools. They do not include [[Theravada]], the only surviving of the 18 classical schools of Buddhism:{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=135}}\n* [[Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika]] ({{bo|w=bye brag smra ba}}). The primary source for the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika is the ''[[Abhidharma-kosa|Abhidharma-ko\u015ba]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] and its commentaries. This system affirms an atomistic view of reality as well the view that perception directly experiences external objects.<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 67.</ref>\n* [[Sautr\u0101ntika]] ({{bo|w=mdo sde pa}}). The ''Abhidharmako\u015ba'' was also an important source for the Sautr\u0101ntikas. [[Dign\u0101ga]] and [[Dharmakirti|Dharmak\u012brti]] are the most prominent exponents. As opposed to Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, this view holds that we do not directly perceive the external world, only phenomenal forms caused by objects and our senses.<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\"/>\n\nThe other two tenets are [[Mahayana]]:\n* [[Yogacara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]], also called ''Cittam\u0101tra''  \"Mind-Only\" ({{bo|w=sems-tsam-pa}}). Yogac\u0101rins base their views on texts from [[Maitreya]], [[Asanga|Asa\u1e45ga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]. Yogacara is often interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]].<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\"/> The system is entirely rejected by the Gelugpa, but elements of it form part of the teachings of the other schools.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=136}}\n* [[Madhyamaka]] ({{bo|w=dbu-ma-pa}}) - The philosophy of [[Nagarjuna|N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]] and [[Aryadeva|\u0100ryadeva]], which affirms that everything is empty of essence ([[svabhava]]) and is ultimately beyond concepts.<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\"/>\n\n:*[[Rangtong]], a term introduced by [[Dolpopa]], which rejects any inherent existing self or nature.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=146-147}} This includes:\n::* [[Svatantrika]]\n:::* Sautrantika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka - [[Bh\u0101viveka]]\n:::* Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka - [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]] and [[Kamala\u015b\u012bla]], the oldest Buddhist teachings to be introduced in Tibet{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=138}}\n::* [[Prasa\u1e45gika]], based on [[Buddhap\u0101lita]] and [[Candrak\u012brti]]. Within prasangika, a further division can be made:\n:::* Intellectual emptiness, which is realized by absolute denial. This is the view of Tsong Khapa and the Gelugpa school, which rejects any statements on an absolute reality beyond mere emptiness.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145}} \n:::* Experiential emptiness, which is realized when the understanding of intellectual emptiness gives way to the recognition of the true [[nature of mind]], c.q. [[rigpa]]. This is the view of Nyingma (Dzogchen) and Sakya.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145}}\n:*[[Shentong]], systematised by Dolpopa, and based on [[Buddha-nature]] teachings and influenced by \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's Yogacara-Madhyamaka. It states that the [[nature of mind]] shines through when emptiness has been realized. This approach is dominant in the Jonang school, and can also be found in the Kagyu tradition.{{sfn|Hookam|1991}}{{sfn|Brunnh\u00f6lzl|2004}}{{sfn|Cornu|2001}}\n\nThe tenet systems are used in monasteries and colleges to teach Buddhist philosophy in a systematic and progressive fashion, each philosophical view being seen as more subtle than its predecessor. Therefore, the four tenets can be seen as a gradual path from a rather easy-to-grasp, \"realistic\" philosophical point of view, to more and more complex and subtle views on the ultimate nature of reality, culminating in the philosophy of the M\u0101dhyamikas, which is widely believed to present the most sophisticated point of view.<ref>Sopa & Hopkins (1977), 67-69; Hopkins (1996).</ref> Non-Tibetan scholars point out that historically, Madhyamaka predates Yogacara, however.<ref>Cf.

Practiced focused texts such as the [[Yogacarabhumi|''Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra'']] and [[Kamala\u015b\u012bla]]'s ''[[Bh\u0101van\u0101krama]]'' are the major sources for meditation.\n\nWhile the Indian texts are often central, original material by key Tibetan scholars is also widely studied and collected into editions called ''sungbum''.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 20.</ref> The commentaries and interpretations that are used to shed light on these texts differ according to tradition. The Gelug school for example, use the works of [[Tsongkhapa]], while other schools may use the more recent work of [[Rim\u00e9 movement]] scholars like [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]].\n\nA corpus of extra-canonical scripture, the [[terma (religion)|treasure texts]] (''terma'') literature is acknowledged by [[Nyingma]] practitioners, but the bulk of the canon that is not commentary was translated from Indian sources. True to its roots in the ''P\u0101la'' system of North India, however, Tibetan Buddhism carries on a tradition of eclectic accumulation and systematisation of diverse Buddhist elements, and pursues their synthesis. Prominent among these achievements have been the [[lamrim|Stages of the Path]] and [[lojong|mind training]] literature, both stemming from teachings by the Indian scholar [[Ati\u015ba]].\n\n===Tantric literature===\n{{Main|Tantras (Buddhism)}}\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the Buddhist Tantras are divided into four or six categories, with several sub-categories for the highest Tantras.\n\nIn the Nyingma, the division is into ''Outer Tantras'' ([[Kriyayoga]], [[Charyayoga]], [[Yogatantra]]); and ''Inner Tantras'' ([[Mahayoga]], [[Anuyoga]], [[Atiyoga]] (Tib. [[Dzogchen]])), which correspond to the \"Anuttarayogatantra\".<ref>\"Yoginitantras are in the secondary literature often called Anuttarayoga. But this is based on a mistaken back translation of the Tibetan translation (rnal byor bla med kyi rgyud) of what appears in Sanskrit texts only as Yog\u0101nuttara or Yoganiruttara (cf. SANDERSON 1994: 97-98, fn.1).\"\n\nIsabelle Onians, \"Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm,\" D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001. pg 70\n</ref> For the Nyingma school, important tantras include the [[Guhyagarbha tantra]], the [[Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra|Guhyasamaja tantra]],<ref name=\":2\">Samuel 2012, p. 32.</ref> the [[Kulayar\u0101ja Tantra]] and the 17 [[Seventeen tantras|Dzogchen tantras]].\n\nIn the Sarma schools, the division is:<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 78.</ref>\n\n* Kriyayoga - These have an emphasis on purification and ritual acts and include texts like the [[Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa|''Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012bm\u016blakalpa'']].\n* Charyayoga - Contain \"a balance between external activities and internal practices\", mainly referring to the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra|Mah\u0101vairocana Abhisa\u1e43bodhi Tantra]].''\n* Yogatantra, is mainly concerned with internal yogic techniques and includes the ''[[Tattvasa\u1e43graha Tantra]].''\n* [[Anuttarayoga Tantra|Anuttarayogatantra]], contains more advanced techniques such as [[subtle body]] practices and is subdivided into: \n**Mother class tantras, which emphasize illusory body and [[Deity yoga|completion stage]] practices and includes the [[Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra|Guhyasamaja tantra]] and Yamantaka tantra.\n**Father class, which emphasize the development stage and [[Luminous mind|clear light mind]] and includes the [[Hevajra Tantra]] and [[Cakrasa\u1e43vara Tantra|Cakrasamvara Tantra]].\n**Non-dual class, which balance the above elements, and mainly refers to the [[Kalacakra|Kalacakra tantra]]\n\nIt is important to note that the root tantras themselves are almost unintelligible without the various Indian and Tibetan commentaries, therefore, they are never studied without the use of the tantric commentarial apparatus.\n\n===Transmission and realization===\nThere is a long history of [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]] of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of a [[Mantra#Mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism|mantra]], for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]]). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in [[Asanga]]'s visions of [[Maitreya]].\n\nAn emphasis on oral transmission as more important than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them.<ref>Conze (1993): 26</ref> Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha in the case of a ''[[S\u016btra|sutra]]'' or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.\n\n==Practices==\n{{See also|Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)}}In Tibetan Buddhism, practices are generally classified as either Sutra (or ''P\u0101ramit\u0101y\u0101na'') or Tantra (''Vajray\u0101na or Mantray\u0101na''), though exactly what constitutes each category and what is included and excluded in each is a matter of debate and differs among the various lineages. According to [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] for example, what separates Tantra from Sutra is the practice of [[Deity yoga]].<ref>Powers 2007, p. 271.</ref>\n\nWhile it is generally held that the practices of Vajray\u0101na are not included in Sutray\u0101na, all Sutray\u0101na practices are common to Vajray\u0101na practice. Traditionally, Vajray\u0101na is held to be a more powerful and effective path, but potentially more difficult and dangerous and thus they should only be undertaken by the advanced who have established a solid basis in other practices.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 50.</ref>\n\n=== P\u0101ramit\u0101 ===\n{{Main|Paramitas}}\nThe [[paramitas|''P\u0101ramit\u0101s'']] (perfections, transcendent virtues) is a key set of virtues which constitute the major practices of a bodhisattva in non-tantric Mahayana. They are:\n\n#''[[D\u0101na]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'': generosity, giving of oneself (Tibetan: \u0f66\u0f56\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f54 ''sbyin-pa'')\n#''[[\u015a\u012bla]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (\u0f5a\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f58\u0f66 ''tshul-khrims'')\n#''[[Kshanti|{{IAST|K\u1e63\u0101nti}}]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (\u0f56\u0f5f\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54 ''bzod-pa'')\n#''[[V\u012brya]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : energy, diligence, vigor, effort (\u0f56\u0f62\u0fa9\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f42\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f66 ''brtson-\u2019grus'')\n#''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|Dhy\u0101na]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : one-pointed concentration, contemplation (\u0f56\u0f66\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f4f\u0f53 ''bsam-gtan'')\n#''[[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : wisdom, insight (\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f56 ''shes-rab'')\n\nThe practice of ''D\u0101na'' (giving) while traditionally referring to offerings of food to the monastics can also refer to the ritual offering of bowls of water, incense, butter lamps and flowers to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on a shrine or household altar.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 45-46.</ref> Similar offerings are also given to other beings such as hungry ghosts, [[dakinis]], protector deities, local divinities etc.\n\nLike other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of the [[five precepts]] and [[Bodhisattva vow]]s is part of Tibetan Buddhist moral (''sila'') practice. In addition to these, there are also numerous sets of Tantric vows, termed [[Samaya]], which are given as part of Tantric initiations.\n\nCompassion (''[[karu\u1e47\u0101]]'') practices are also particularly important in Tibetan Buddhism. One of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the ''[[Bodhisattvacary\u0101vat\u0101ra]]'' by [[Shantideva]]. In the eighth section entitled ''Meditative Concentration'', Shantideva describes meditation on Karun\u0101 as thus:\n\n{{quote|Strive at first to meditate upon the sameness of yourself and others. In joy and sorrow all are equal; Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself. The hand and other limbs are many and distinct, But all are one--the body to kept and guarded. Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows, are, like me, all one in wanting happiness. This pain of mine does not afflict or cause discomfort to another's body, and yet this pain is hard for me to bear because I cling and take it for my own. And other beings' pain I do not feel, and yet, because I take them for myself, their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear. And therefore I'll dispel the pain of others, for it is simply pain, just like my own.  And others I will aid and benefit, for they are living beings, like my body. Since I and other beings both, in wanting happiness, are equal and alike, what difference is there to distinguish us, that I should strive to have my bliss alone?\"<ref>''The Way of the Bodhisattva'' by Shantideva.  Shambhala Publications.  Page 122-123</ref>}}\n\nA popular compassion meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is ''[[Tonglen]]'' (sending and taking love and suffering respectively). Practices associated with [[Avalokite\u015bvara|Chenrezig]] (Avalokiteshvara), also tend to focus on compassion.\n\n===Samatha and Vipa\u015byan\u0101===\n[[File:Young monk in meditation cell, Yerpa, Tibet. 1993.jpg|thumb|Young monk in meditation retreat, [[Yerpa]], [[Tibet]] in 1993]]\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] defines meditation (''bsgom pa'') as \"familiarization of the mind with an object of meditation.\"<ref>Powers 2007, p. 81.</ref> Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhism follows the two main approaches to [[meditation]] or mental cultivation (''[[bhavana]]'') as taught in all forms of Buddhism, [[\u015bamatha]] (Tib. ''Shine'') and [[vipa\u015byan\u0101]] (''lhaktong'').\n\nThe practice of [[\u015bamatha]] (calm abiding) is one of focusing one's mind on a single object such as a Buddha figure or the breath. Through repeated practice one's mind gradually becomes more stable, calm and happy. It is defined by [[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal|Takpo Tashi Namgyal]] as \"fixing the mind upon any object so as to maintain it without distraction...focusing the mind on an object and maintaining it in that state until finally it is channeled into one stream of attention and evenness.\"<ref>Powers 2007, p. 86.</ref> The [[Samatha#Nine mental abidings|nine mental abidings]] is the main progressive framework used for \u015bamatha in Tibetan Buddhism.<ref>Powers 2007, p. 88.</ref> Once a meditator has reached the ninth level of this schema they achieve what is termed \"pliancy\" (Tib. ''shin tu sbyangs pa'', Skt. ''[[Pra\u015brabdhi|prasrabdhi]]''), defined as \"a serviceability of mind and body such that the mind can be set on a virtuous object of observation as long as one likes; it has the function of removing all obstructions.\" This is also said to be very joyful and blissful for the body and the mind.<ref>Powers 2007, p. 90.</ref>\n\nThe other form of Buddhist meditation is [[vipa\u015byan\u0101]] (clear seeing, higher insight), which in Tibetan Buddhism is generally practiced after having attained proficiency in [[\u015bamatha]].<ref>Powers 2007, p. 91.</ref> This is generally seen as having two aspects, one of which is [[Vipassan\u0101#Inductive and deductive analysis in the Indo-Tibetan tradition|analytic meditation]], thinking rationally about ideas and concepts in a scholarly or philosophical manner. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions.{{sfn|khri byang blo bzang ye shes bstan \u02bcdzin rgya mtsho|2006|p=66, 212f}} The other type of [[vipa\u015byan\u0101]]  is a non-analytical, \"simple\" yogic style called ''tr\u00f6meh'' in Tibetan, which means \"without complication\".<ref>''The Practice of Tranquillity & Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Meditation'' by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. Shambhala Publications: 1994. {{ISBN|0-87773-943-9}} pg 91-93</ref>\n\nA meditation routine may involve alternating sessions of vipa\u015byan\u0101 to achieve deeper levels of realization, and samatha to consolidate them.<ref name=\"Hopkins 1996\" />\n\n===Preliminary practices===\n{{see also|Ng\u00f6ndro}}\n[[File:Mongol praying at a shrine in urga.jpg|thumb|Buddhist praying at a shrine in [[Ulaanbaatar|urga]].]]\n[[File:IMG_1016_Lhasa_Barkhor.jpg|thumb|Buddhists performing prostrations in front of [[Jokhang Monastery]].]]\n\n[[Vajray\u0101na]] is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be the fastest method for attaining Buddhahood but for unqualified practitioners it can be dangerous.<ref>Pabonka, p.649</ref> To engage in it one must receive an appropriate initiation (also known as an \"empowerment\") from a lama who is fully qualified to give it. The aim of [[ng\u00f6ndro|preliminary practices]] (''ng\u00f6ndro'') is to start the student on the correct path for such higher teachings.<ref>Kalu Rinpoche (1986), ''The Gem Ornament of Manifold Instructions''. Snow Lion, p. 21.</ref> Just as Sutray\u0101na preceded Vajray\u0101na historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones. Preliminary practices include all ''Sutray\u0101na'' activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principle stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic [[bodhicitta]] wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without the basis of these three in particular to practice Vajray\u0101na can be like a small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.<ref>[[Pabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo]], 649</ref>\n\nThe most widespread preliminary practices include: taking [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]], [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostration]], [[Vajrasattva]] meditation, mandala offering and [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]].<ref>Powers 2007, p. 295.</ref>\n\nThe merit acquired in the preliminary practices facilitates progress in Vajray\u0101na. While many Buddhists may spend a lifetime exclusively on sutra practices, however, an amalgam of the two to some degree is common. For example, in order to train in [[calm abiding]], one might use a tantric visualisation as the meditation object.\n\n====Guru yoga====\n{{see also|Guru#In_Buddhism|label 1=Guru in Buddhism}}\n\nAs in other Buddhist traditions, an attitude of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized.<ref>''Lama'' is the literal Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit ''guru''. For a traditional perspective on devotion to the guru, see Tsong-ka-pa I, 77-87. For a current perspective on the guru-disciple relationship in Tibetan Buddhism, see [http://studybuddhism.com/web/x/nav/group.html_1305527811.html Berzin, Alexander. ''Relating to a Spiritual Teacher: Building a Healthy Relationship'']</ref> At the beginning of a public teaching, a ''[[lama]]'' will do [[prostration]]s to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources.<ref>notably, ''Gurupancasika'', Tib.: ''Lama Ngachupa'', Wylie: ''bla-ma lnga-bcu-pa'', \"Fifty Verses of Guru-Devotion\" by [[A\u015bvagho\u1e63a]]</ref> By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.\n\nThere is a general sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a ''lama''. A student may have taken teachings from many authorities and revere them all as ''lamas'' in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru.<ref>Indian tradition (Cf. ''Saddharmapundarika Sutra'' II, 124) encourages the student to view the guru as representative of the Buddha himself.</ref>\n\nOne particular feature of the Tantric view of teacher student relationship is that in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, one is instructed to regard one's guru as an awakened Buddha.<ref name=\"Kapstein 80\" />\n\n===Esotericism and vows===\n[[File:Sand mandala. Drongste Gompa 1993.JPG|thumb|A [[sand mandala]]]]\nIn Vajray\u0101na particularly, Tibetan Buddhists subscribe to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated do not seek and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a [[Mandalas|mandala]] may be less public than that of a deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajray\u0101na is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.\n\nBuddhism has always had a taste for [[esotericism]] since its earliest period in India.<ref>Cf. Conze (1993), 26 and 52f.</ref> Tibetans today maintain greater or lesser degrees of confidentiality also with information on the ''[[vinaya]]'' and [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|emptiness]] specifically. In Buddhist teachings generally, too, there is caution about revealing information to people who may be unready for it.\n\nPracticing tantra also includes the maintaining of a separate set of vows, which are called ''[[Samaya]] (dam tshig)''. There are various lists of these and they may differ depending on the practice and one's lineage or individual guru. Upholding these vows is said to be essential for tantric practice and breaking them is said to cause great harm.<ref>Powers 2007, p. 315.</ref>[[File:Ritual musical instruments in Tibet - MIM Brussels (2015-05-30 07.00.30 by chibicode).jpg|thumb|right|Ritual musical instruments from Tibet; MIM Brussels.]]\n\n===Rites and rituals===\n[[File:Chenrezig empowerment seattle sakya.jpg|thumb|right|The reading of the text - the 'lung' - during an empowerment for [[Chenrezig]].]]\nThere has been a \"close association\" between the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the temporal<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cueppers|first=Christoph|title=The Relationship Between Religion and State (chos srid zung 'brel) In Traditional Tibet|url=https://www.academia.edu/2262393|language=en}}</ref> in Tibet. The term for this relationship is ''chos srid zung 'brel.'' Traditionally Tibetan lamas have tended to the lay populace by helping them with issues such as protection and prosperity. Common traditions have been the various rites and rituals for mundane ends, such as purifying one's karma, avoiding harm from demonic forces and enemies, and promoting a successful harvest.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''.

''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 5.</ref>\n\nRitual is generally more elaborate than in other forms of Buddhism, with complex altar arrangements and works of art (such as [[mandala]]s and [[thangka]]s), many ritual objects, hand gestures (''[[mudra]]''), chants, and musical instruments.<ref name=\"Kapstein 82\"/>\n\nA special kind of ritual called [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|an initiation or empowerment]] (Sanskrit: ''Abhiseka'', Tibetan: ''Wangkur'') is central to Tantric practice. These rituals consecrate a practitioner into a particular Tantric practice associated with individual mandalas of deities and mantras. Without having gone through initiation, one is generally not allowed to practice the higher Tantras.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 81.</ref>\n\nAnother important ritual occasion in Tibetan Buddhism is that of [[Funeral|mortuary rituals]] which are supposed to assure that one has a positive rebirth and a good spiritual path in the future.<ref name=\"Kapstein 94\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 94.</ref> Of central importance to Tibetan Buddhist ''[[Ars moriendi]]'' is the idea of the [[Bardo]] (Sanskrit: ''antar\u0101bhava''), the intermediate or liminal state between life and death.<ref name=\"Kapstein 94\"/> Rituals and the readings of texts such as the [[Bardo Thodol]] are done to ensure that the dying person can navigate this intermediate state skillfully. [[Cremation]] and [[sky burial]] are traditionally the main [[funeral]] rites used to dispose of the body.<ref name=\"Kapstein, Matthew T. 2014, p. 100\"/>\n\n===Mantra===\n[[File:IMG 0996 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|An elderly [[Tibet]]an woman with a [[prayer wheel]] inscribed with mantras]]\nThe use of (mainly [[Sanskrit]]) prayer formulas, incantations or phrases called [[mantras]] (Tibetan: ''sngags'') is another widespread feature of Tibetan Buddhist practice.<ref name=\"Kapstein 80\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 80.</ref> So common is the use of mantras that [[Vajrayana]] is also sometimes called \"''Mantray\u0101na''\" (the mantra vehicle). Mantras are widely recited, chanted, written or inscribed, and visualized as part of different forms of meditation. Each mantra has symbolic meaning and will often have a connection to a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 23-24</ref> Each deity's mantra is seen as symbolizing the function, speech and power of the deity.<ref>Samuel, Geoffrey. Introducing Tibetan Buddhism (World Religions), 2012, p. 74</ref> Tibetan Buddhist practitioners repeat mantras in order to train the mind, and transform their thoughts in line with the divine qualities of the mantra's deity and special power.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 265</ref>\n\nTibetan Buddhists see the etymology of the term mantra as meaning \"mind protector\", and mantras is seen as a way to guard the mind against negativity.<ref>Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr. The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism</ref> According to [[Lama Zopa Rinpoche]]:\n\n<blockquote>Mantras are effective because they help keep your mind quiet and peaceful,  automatically integrating it into one-pointedness.  They make your mind receptive to very subtle vibrations and thereby heighten your perception. Their recitation eradicates gross negativities and the true nature of things can then be reflected in your mind\u2019s resulting clarity. By practising a transcendental mantra, you can in fact purify all the defiled energy of your body, speech, and mind.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 266-67</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nMantras also serve to focus the mind as a [[samatha]] (calming) practice as well as a way to transform the mind through the symbolic meaning of the mantra. In Buddhism, it is important to have the proper intention, focus and faith when practicing mantras, if one does not, they will not work. Unlike in Hinduism, mantras are not believed to have inherent power of their own, and thus without the proper faith, intention and mental focus, they are just mere sounds.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 267</ref> Thus according to the Tibetan philosopher [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Jamgon Ju Mipham]]:\n\n<blockquote>if a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like non-conceptual wish-fulfilling jewels. Infusing one's being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon reflected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon's reflection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one's being.<ref>Jamgon Mipham, Luminous Essence: A Guide to the Guhyagarbha Tantra, page 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMantras are part of the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism, such as [[Deity Yoga]] and are recited and visualized during tantric [[sadhana]]s. Thus, [[Tsongkhapa]] says that mantra \"protects the mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions\".<ref>Tso\u1e45-kha-pa Blo-bza\u1e45-grags-pa. Tantra in Tibet: The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1987, page 47.</ref> This is because in Tibetan Buddhist Tantric praxis, one must develop a sense that everything is divine.\n\n===Tantric Yoga===\n{{See also|Deity yoga}}\n[[File:Ch\u00f6d practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Ch\u00f6d]] ritual, note the use of [[Damaru]] drum and hand-bell, as well as the [[Kangling]] (thighbone trumpet).]]\nIn what is called ''[[Anuttarayoga tantra|higher yoga tantra]]'' the emphasis is on various yoga practices which allow the practitioner to realize the true nature of reality.<ref name=\"Kapstein 83\"/>\n\n''[[Deity Yoga]]'' (Tibetan: ''lha'i rnal 'byor''; Sanskrit: ''Devata-yoga'') is a fundamental practice of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] involving [[mental image|visualization of mental image]]s consisting mainly of [[Buddhist deities]] such as Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and [[fierce deities]], along mantra repetition. According to Geoffrey Samuel: <blockquote>If Buddhahood is a source of infinite potentiality accessible at any time, then the Tantric deities are in a sense partial aspects, refractions of that total potentiality. Visualizing one of these deities, or oneself identifying with one of them, is not, in Tibetan Tantric thought, a technique to worship an external entity. Rather, it is a way of accessing or tuning into something that is an intrinsic part of the structure of the universe \u2014 as of course is the practitioner him or herself.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 71.</ref></blockquote>Deity yoga involves two stages, the '''generation stage''' and the '''completion stage'''. In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity (''[[yidam]]''), its [[mandala]] and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality.<ref>Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 52</ref> In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of [[sunyata]] or emptiness.\n\nCompletion stage practices can also include [[subtle body]] energy practices,<ref>Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45</ref> as well as other practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].\n\nThe views and practices associated with [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] are often seen as the culmination of the tantric path.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 87.</ref> These practices focus on the very nature of reality and experience, termed ''[[dharmakaya]]'' or ''[[rigpa]]''.\n\n== Institutions and Clergy ==\n[[File:Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, the 16th Karmapa with Gelongma Karma Kechog Palmo (Freda Bedi) at Rumtek Monastery, Sikkim in 1971.jpg|thumb|[[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje]], the 16th [[Karmapa]], with [[Freda Bedi]] (the first Western nun in Tibetan Buddhism), at [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Sikkim]].]]\n\n[[File:India - Ladakh - Leh - 012 - lonely gompa south of Leh (3841440587).jpg|thumb|A small ''gompa'' (religious building) in [[Ladakh]]]]\n\n[[File:Chagdud.jpg|thumb|[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], a tulku and a ngagpa (note the white and red robes).]][[Buddhist monasticism]] is an important part of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, all the major and minor schools maintain large monastic institutions based on the [[Mulasarvastivada]] [[Vinaya]] (monastic rule) and many religious leaders come from the monastic community. That being said, there are also many religious leaders or teachers (called ''[[Lama]]s'' and ''[[Guru]]s'') which are not celibate monastics. According to Geoffrey Samuel this is where \"religious leadership in Tibetan Buddhism contrasts most strongly with much of the rest of the Buddhist world.\"<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 130.</ref> Lamas are generally skilled and experienced tantric practitioners and ritual specialists in a specific initiation lineage and may be laypersons or monastics. They act not just as teachers, but as spiritual guides and guardians of the lineage teachings that they have received through a long and intimate process of apprenticeship with their Lamas.<ref>Samuel 2012, pp. 131-134.</ref>\n\nTibetan Buddhism also includes a number of [[lay clergy]] and lay tantric specialists, such as [[Ngagpa|''Ngagpas'']] (Skt. ''mantr\u012b''), ''Gomchens'', ''Serkyims'', and ''Ch\u00f6dpas'' (practitioners of [[Ch\u00f6d]]). According to Samuel, in the more remote parts of the Himalayas, communities were often led by lay religious specialists.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 141.</ref> Thus, while the large monastic institutions were present in the regions of the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan plateau]] which were more centralized politically, in other regions they were absent and instead smaller [[Gompa|''gompas'']] and more lay oriented communities prevailed.<ref>Samuel 2012 p. 158.</ref>\n\nSamuel outlines four main types of religious communities in Tibet:<ref>Samuel 2012 pp. 159-162.</ref>\n\n* Small communities of lay practitioners attached to a temple and a lama. Lay practitioners might stay in the ''gompa'' for periodic retreats.\n* Small communities of celibate monastics attached to a temple and a lama, often part of a village.\n* Medium to large communities of celibate monastics. These could maintain several hundred monks and might have extensive land holdings, be financially independent, and sometimes also act as trading centers.\n* Large teaching monasteries with thousands of monks, such as the big Gelug establishments of [[Sera Monastery|Sera]] (with over 6000 monks in the first half of the 20th century) and [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung]] (over 7000).<ref>Chapman F. Spencer. ''Lhasa the Holy City'', p. 195. Readers Union Ltd., London.</ref>\n\nIn some cases a lama is the leader of a spiritual community. Some lamas gain their title through being part of particular family which maintains a lineage of hereditary lamas (and are thus often laypersons). One example is the Sakya family of Kon, who founded the [[Sakya]] school and another is the hereditary lamas of [[Mindrolling Monastery|Mindrolling monastery]].<ref>Samuel 2012, pp. 140-141.</ref>\n\nIn other cases, lamas may be seen as \"[[Tulku|T\u00fclkus\"]] (\"incarnations\"). [[Tulku|T\u00fclkus]] are figures which are recognized as reincarnations of a particular bodhisattva or a previous religious figure. They are often recognized from a young age through the use of [[divination]] and the use of the possessions of the deceased lama, and therefore are able to receive extensive training. They are sometimes groomed to become leaders of monastic institutions.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 146.</ref> Examples include the [[Dalai Lamas]] and the [[Karmapa]]s, each of which are seen as key leaders in their respective traditions.\n\nThe system of [[Tulku|incarnate lamas]] is popularly held to be a Tibetan alteration to Indian Buddhism.\n\nAnother title unique to Tibetan Buddhism is that of [[Tert\u00f6n]] (treasure discoverer), who are considered capable of revealing or discovering special revelations or texts called [[Terma (religion)|Termas]] (lit. \"hidden treasure\"). They are also associated with the idea of ''[[beyul]]'' (\"hidden valleys\"), which are power places associated with deities and hidden religious treasures.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 144.</ref><br />\n\n===Women in Tibetan Buddhism===\n{{further|Women in Buddhism|Ordination of women in Buddhism}}\n[[File:Machik Labdron.jpg|thumb|[[Machig Labdr\u00f6n]], a famous female tantrika, teacher and founder of the [[Ch\u00f6d]] lineage]]\n[[File:Ayu-khandro.jpg|thumb|Painting of Ayu Khandro at Merigar West.

This might be because of the smaller household sizes and low population density in Tibet.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 206.</ref>  Women traditionally took many roles in Tibetan Buddhism, from lay supporters, to monastics, lamas and tantric practitioners.\n\nThere is evidence for the importance of female practitioners in Indian Tantric Buddhism and pre-modern Tibetan Buddhism. At least one major lineage of tantric teachings, the [[Shangpa Kagyu]], traces itself to Indian female teachers and there have been a series of important female Tibetan teachers, such as [[Yeshe Tsogyal]] and [[Machig Labdr\u00f6n]].<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 214.</ref> It seems that even though it might have been more difficult for women to become serious tantric yoginis, it was still possible for them to find lamas that would teach them high tantric practices.\n\nSome Tibetan women become lamas by being born in one of the hereditary lama families such as [[Khandro Rinpoche|Mindrolling Jets\u00fcn Khandro Rinpoche]] and Sakya Jets\u00fcn Kushok Chimey Luding.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 216.</ref> There have also been cases of influential female lamas who were also tert\u00f6ns, such as [[Kunzang Dekyong Wangmo|Sera Khandro]], [[Tare Lhamo]] and [[Ayu Khandro]].\n\nSome of these figures were also tantric consorts (''sangyum, kandroma'') with male lamas, and thus took part in the sexual practices associated with the highest levels of tantric practice.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 215.</ref>\n\n==== Nuns ====\nWhile monasticism is practiced there by women, it is much less common (2 percent of the population in the 20th century compared to 12 percent of men). Nuns were also much less respected by Tibetan society than monks and may receive less lay support than male monastics.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 211.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Tibetan Buddhist nuns were also not \"fully ordained\" as [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs]] (who take the full set of monastic vows in the [[Vinaya]]). When Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs]] required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet.{{sfn|Tsomo|1999|p=22}}{{refn|group=note|Under the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya, as with the two other extant Vinaya lineages today ([[Theravada]] and [[Dharmaguptaka]]), in order to ordain bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs, there must be quorums of both bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs ''and'' bhik\u1e63us; without both, a woman cannot be ordained as a nun ({{bo|t=\u0f51\u0f42\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fb3\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f0b|s=g\u00e9longma}}).}} Despite an absence of ordination there, bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs did travel to Tibet.

Speaking in general terms, were the Buddha to come to this 21st century world, I feel that most likely, seeing the actual situation in the world now, he might change the rules somewhat....\"\n#Later, in [[Z\u00fcrich]] during a 2005 conference of Tibetan Buddhist Centers, he said, \"Now I think the time has come; we should start a working group or committee\" to meet with monks from other Buddhist traditions. Looking at the German bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b [[Jampa Tsedroen]], he instructed, \"I prefer that Western Buddhist nuns carry out this work\u2026 Go to different places for further research and discuss with senior monks (from various Buddhist countries).

One of the most influential terma cycles is the [[Longchen Nyingthig]] which was revealed by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730\u20131798).\n\n====Sakya====\n{{Main|Sakya}}\n[[File:Sakya Pandita.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sakya Pandita]]]]\nThe \"Grey Earth\" school represents one of the first ''Sarma'' (new translation) scholarly traditions. Headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], this tradition was founded by Kh\u00f6n K\u00f6nchok Gyelpo ({{bo|w='khon dkon mchog rgyal po}}, 1034\u20131102), a disciple of the great [[Lotsawa]], Drogmi Sh\u0101kya ({{bo|w=brog mi lo ts\u0101 wa ye shes}}) and traces its lineage to the [[mahasiddha]] Vir\u016bpa.<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com\"/> A renowned exponent, [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182\u20131251CE), was the great-grandson of Kh\u00f6n K\u00f6nchok Gyelpo.\nSakyapa, the last one, was named because of the Sakya Monastery, of which the wall was painted into Red, White, and Cyan.\n\n====Bodong====\nThe [[Bodongpa|Bodong]] school is one of the minor schools, being much smaller and less influential than the four main schools. This tradition was founded in 1049 by the Kadam teacher Mudra Chenpo, who also established the Bodong E Monastery. Its most famous teacher was Bodong Penchen L\u00e9nam Gyelchok (1376-1451) who authored over one hundred and thirty-five volumes.\n\nThis tradition is also known for maintaining a female tulku lineage of incarnated lamas called the [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]].\n\n====Kagyu====\n{{Main|Kagyu}}\n[[File:Bhutanese_painted_thanka_of_Milarepa_(1052-1135),_Late_19th-early_20th_Century,_Dhodeydrag_Gonpa,_Thimphu,_Bhutan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Milarepa]]]]\n\nKagyu means \"oral transmission\" and consists of a series of lineages which all trace themselves back to Indian [[mahasiddha]]s like [[Saraha]] and [[Tilopa]]. Its most famous Tibetan exponent was [[Milarepa]], an 11th-century mystic. It is often divided into the larger [[Dagpo Kagyu]] and the smaller Shangpa Kagyu lineage\n\nThe Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Marpa Lotsawa]], Milarepa and [[Gampopa]]<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com\" /> and consists of four major sub-sects: the [[Karma Kagyu]], headed by a [[Karmapa]], the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu's founder, [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]]. The most notable of these are the [[Drikung Kagyu|Drikung]] and [[Drukpa Lineage]]s.\n\nThe once-obscure [[Shangpa Kagyu]], which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher [[Kalu Rinpoche]], traces its history back to the Indian female siddhas [[Niguma]] and [[Sukhasiddhi]], transmitted to Tibet via [[Khyungpo Naljor]] in the 11th century.<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com\" />\n\n====Jonang====\n{{Main|Jonang}}\nThe Jonang is a minor school which can be traced to early 12th century master [[Yumo Mikyo Dorje]], but was popularized by the influential master [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|D\u00f6lpopa Sh\u00e9rap Gyeltsen]] (1292\u20131361).\n\nThe Jonang re-established their religio-political center in [[Golok people|Golok]], [[Nakhi people|Nakhi]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] areas in [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] centered at [[Dzamthang Monastery]] and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. The tradition was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.\n\nHowever, their teachings were limited to these regions until the [[Rim\u00e9 movement]] of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice.<ref name=Gruschke>Gruschke 2001, p.72; and A.

Tibetan Studies I'' (Proceedings of the Ninth Seminar of The IATS, 2000), Brill Academic Publishers, Leiden 2002, pp. 183-214</ref> In modern times it has been encouraged to grow by the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who installed the [[9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] as its head.\n\n====Gelug====\n{{Main|Gelug}}\n[[File:Ganden_monastery,_2013.jpg|thumb|[[Ganden monastery]], Tibet, 2013]]\nThe \"Way of Virtue\" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa]], renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. He was a prominent supporter of the [[Madhyamika]] philosophy and formalized the [[Svatantrika-Prasa\u1e45gika distinction]]. Its spiritual head is the [[Ganden Tripa]] and its temporal one the [[Dalai Lama]]. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the embodiment of [[Avalokite\u015bvara]]. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas ruled [[Tibet]] from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.\nGelugpa is the youngest but largest sect of Tibetan Buddhism. People also call it the Yellow Sect due to the hat they wear is yellow color. The founder of Gelugpa is Tsongkhapa, a great master. The discipline of Gelugpa is very strict. Followers could not get married, could not eat meat, could not drink alcoholic beverages. Most of the famous monasteries in Tibet admire Gelugpa, such as Ganden Monastery, Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery in Lhasa, and Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse.\n\n==== Yungdrung Bon ====\nWhile [[Bon|Yungdrung Bon]] considers itself a separate religion with pre-Buddhist origins, and it is considered as non-Buddhist by the main Tibetan traditions, it shares so many similarities and practices with mainstream Tibetan Buddhism that some scholars such as Geoffrey Samuel see it as \"essentially a variant of Tibetan Buddhism\".<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 232.</ref> It is much more related to Nyingma Buddhism, and includes [[Dzogchen]] teachings, similar deities, rituals and forms of monasticism.<br />\n\n== Glossary of terms used ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"750\"\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''English'''\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''spoken Tibetan'''\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''Wylie Tibetan'''\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''Sanskrit transliteration'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |affliction\n|align=\"center\" |ny\u00f6nmong\n|align=\"center\" |nyon-mongs\n|align=\"center\" |kle\u015ba\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |analytic meditation\n|align=\"center\" |jegom\n|align=\"center\" |dpyad-sgom\n|align=\"center\" |yauktika dhy\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |calm abiding\n|align=\"center\" |shin\u00e9\n|align=\"center\" |zhi-gnas\n|align=\"center\" |\u015bamatha\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |devotion to the guru\n|align=\"center\" |lama-la tenpa\n|align=\"center\" |bla-ma-la bsten-pa\n|align=\"center\" |guruparyup\u0101sati\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |fixation meditation\n|align=\"center\" |joggom\n|align=\"center\" |'jog-sgom\n|align=\"center\" |nibandhita dhy\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |foundational vehicle\n|align=\"center\" |t\u2019ek m\u00e4n\n|align=\"center\" |theg sman\n|align=\"center\" |h\u012bnay\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |incarnate lama\n|align=\"center\" |t\u00fclku\n|align=\"center\" |sprul-sku\n|align=\"center\" |nirm\u0101nak\u0101ya\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |inherent existence\n|align=\"center\" |rangzhingi drubpa\n|align=\"center\" |rang-bzhin-gyi grub-pa\n|align=\"center\" |svabh\u0101vasiddha\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |mind of enlightenment\n|align=\"center\" |changchub sem\n|align=\"center\" |byang-chhub sems\n|align=\"center\" |bodhicitta\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |motivational training\n|align=\"center\" |lojong\n|align=\"center\" |blo-sbyong\n|align=\"center\" |autsukya dhy\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |omniscience\n|align=\"center\" |t\u2019amc\u00e9 k\u2019yempa\n|align=\"center\" |thams-cad mkhyen-pa\n|align=\"center\" |sarvaj\u00f1a\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |preliminary practices\n|align=\"center\" |ng\u00f6ndro\n|align=\"center\" |sngon-'gro\n|align=\"center\" |pr\u0101rambhika kriy\u0101ni\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |root guru\n|align=\"center\" |zaw\u00e9 lama\n|align=\"center\" |rtsa-ba'i bla-ma\n|align=\"center\" |m\u016blaguru\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |stages of the path\n|align=\"center\" |lamrim\n|align=\"center\" |lam-rim\n|align=\"center\" |p\u0101theya\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |transmission and realisation\n|align=\"center\" |lungtok\n|align=\"center\" |lung-rtogs\n|align=\"center\" |\u0101gam\u0101dhigama\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col}}<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n*[[Buddhism in Sri Lanka]]\n*[[Buddhist deities]]\n*[[Chinese Buddhism]]\n*[[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]]\n*[[Death horoscopes in Tibetan Buddhism]]\n*[[Derge Parkhang]]\n*[[Fierce deities]]\n*[[History of Tibetan Buddhism]]\n*[[Karma in Tibetan Buddhism]]\n*[[Keydong Thuk-Che-Cho-Ling Nunnery]]\n*[[Mahamudra]]\n*[[Milarepa]]\n*[[Nagarjuna]]\n*[[Ngagpa]]\n*[[Padmasambhava]]\n*[[Pure Land Buddhism]] (Tibetan)\n*[[Samaya]]\n*[[Schools of Buddhism]]\n*[[Shambhala Buddhism]]\n*[[Songs of realization]]\n*[[Taklung Tangpa]]\n*[[Tibetan art]]\n*[[:Category:Tibetan Buddhist teachers|Tibetan Buddhist teachers (category)]]\n*[[Tibetan prayer flag]]\n*[[Tibetan prayer wheel]]\n*[[Traditional Tibetan medicine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- B -->\n* {{Citation | last = Brunnh\u00f6lzl  |first = Karl  |year = 2004 | title = The Center of the Sunlit Sky: Madhyamaka in the Kagyu Tradition  | publisher = Shambhala | isbn = 1-55939-218-5 }}\n<!-- C -->\n* Coleman, Graham, ed.

It is also found in the regions surrounding the [[Himalayas]] (such as [[Buddhism in Bhutan|Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Sikkim]]), much of Chinese [[Central Asia]], the Southern [[Siberia]]n regions such as [[Tuva]], as well as [[Mongolia]].\n\nTibetan Buddhism is a form of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism stemming from the latest stages of [[Indian Buddhism]] (and so is also part of the tantric [[Vajrayana]] tradition). It thus preserves \"the [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] status quo of eighth-century India.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=White |first=David Gordon (ed.) |year=2000 |page=21 |title=Tantra in Practice |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-05779-6 }}</ref> However, it also includes native Tibetan developments and practices. In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271\u20131368), founded by [[Kublai Khan]], which ruled [[China]], Mongolia and parts of Siberia. In the [[Modern history|modern era]], it has spread outside of Asia due to the efforts of the [[Tibetan diaspora]].\n\nApart from classical Mahayana Buddhist practices like the [[P\u0101ramit\u0101|six perfections]], Tibetan Buddhism also includes [[Tantra|Tantric]] practices, such as [[deity yoga]] and the [[Six Dharmas of Naropa]].

''pa\u00f1cam\u0101rga''; Tib. ''lam nga'') which are:<ref>Powers 2007, pp. 93-96</ref>\n\n# The path of accumulation - in which one collects wisdom and merit, generates [[bodhicitta]], cultivates the [[four foundations of mindfulness]] and [[Right effort|right effort (the \"four abandonments\")]].\n# The path of preparation - Is attained when one reaches the union of calm abiding and higher insight meditations (see below) and one becomes familiar with [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|emptiness]]. \n# The path of seeing - one perceives emptiness directly, all thoughts of subject and object are overcome, one becomes an ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|arya]]''.\n# The path of meditation - one removes subtler traces from one's mind and perfects one's understanding. \n# The path of no more learning - which culminates in Buddhahood.\n\nThe schema of the five paths is often elaborated and merged with the concept of the [[Bh\u016bmi (Buddhism)|''bhumis'']] or the bodhisattva levels.\n\n===Lamrim===\n{{Main|Lamrim}}\n''Lamrim'' (\"stages of the path\") is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] schema for presenting the stages of spiritual practice leading to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]]. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of ''lamrim'', presented by different teachers of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools.<ref>The [[Sakya]] school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the ''[[lamdr\u00e9]]''.</ref> However, all versions of the ''lamrim'' are elaborations of [[Atisha|Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th-century root text ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa|A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa'').<ref name=\"thubten\">[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment]</ref>\n\nAtisha's ''lamrim'' system generally divides practitioners into those of ''lesser'', ''middling'' and ''superior'' scopes or attitudes:\n*The lesser person is to focus on the preciousness of human birth as well as contemplation of death and impermanence.\n*The middling person is taught to contemplate [[karma]], [[dukkha]] (suffering) and the benefits of liberation and refuge. \n*The superior scope is said to encompass the four [[Brahmavihara]]s, the [[bodhisattva]] vow, the six [[paramitas]] as well as Tantric practices.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 52-53.</ref>\n\nAlthough ''lamrim'' texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways and with different emphasis depending on the school and tradition it belongs to. [[Gampopa]] and [[Tsongkhapa]] expanded the short root-text of Ati\u015ba into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like [[karma]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], [[Buddhist cosmology]] and the practice of [[meditation]] are gradually explained in logical order.\n\n===Vajray\u0101na===\n[[File:Hevajra-Tibetan.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the tantric figures [[Hevajra]] and [[Nairatmya|Nair\u0101tmy\u0101]], Tibet, 18th Century.]]\nTibetan Buddhism is a form of [[Vajray\u0101na]] (''[[Vajra]] vehicle''), \"Secret Mantra\" (Skt. ''guhyamantra'') or Buddhist [[Tantra]], affirming the views espoused in the texts known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]] (dating from around the 7th century CE onwards).<ref name=\"Powers, 2007, p. 250\">Powers, 2007, p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[Tantra]] (Tib. ''rgyud'') generally refers to forms of religious practice which emphasize the use of unique visualizations, ideas, symbols and rituals for inner transformation.<ref name=\"Powers, 2007, p. 250\"/> The Vajrayana is seen by its adherents as the fastest and most powerful vehicle for enlightenment because it contains many skillful means (''[[upaya]]'') and because it takes the effect ([[Buddhahood]] itself, or [[Buddha nature]]) as the path (and hence is sometimes known as the \"effect vehicle\", ''phalayana'').<ref name=\"Powers, 2007, p. 250\"/>\n\nAn important element of Tantric practice are tantric deities and their [[mandala]]s. These deities come in peaceful (''shiwa'') and [[Fierce deities|fierce (''trowo'') forms]].<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 69.</ref>\n\nTantric texts also generally affirm the use of sense pleasures and other [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] in Tantric ritual as a path to enlightenment, as opposed to non-Tantric Buddhism which affirms that one must renounce all sense pleasures.<ref name=\"Kapstein 82\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 82.</ref> These practices are based on the theory of transformation which states that negative or sensual mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. As the [[Hevajra tantra]] states:\n\n<blockquote>Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.<ref>Snellgrove, David. (1987) ''Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors''. pp 125-126.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother element of the Tantras is their use of transgressive practices, such as drinking [[taboo]] substances such as alcohol or [[Karmamudr\u0101|sexual yoga]]. While in many cases these transgressions were interpreted only symbolically, in other cases they are practiced literally.<ref name=\"Kapstein 83\">Kapstein, Matthew T.

[[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101|Shunyata]], the true nature of reality, or the emptiness of [[Svabhava|inherent existence]] (''svabhava'') of all things, is traditionally propounded according to a hierarchical classification of four classical Indian philosophical schools.\n\nWhile the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelug school, is limited to four tenets (Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, Sautr\u0101ntika, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the ''shentong''-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical emptiness of the Gelugpa-school, and the experiential emptiness of the Nyingma and the Sakya.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}\n\nTwo tenets belong to the path referred to as the [[Hinayana]], and are both [[Sarvastivada]]-subschools. They do not include [[Theravada]], the only surviving of the 18 classical schools of Buddhism:{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=135}}\n* [[Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika]] ({{bo|w=bye brag smra ba}}). The primary source for the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika is the ''[[Abhidharma-kosa|Abhidharma-ko\u015ba]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] and its commentaries. This system affirms an atomistic view of reality as well the view that perception directly experiences external objects.<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 67.</ref>\n* [[Sautr\u0101ntika]] ({{bo|w=mdo sde pa}}). The ''Abhidharmako\u015ba'' was also an important source for the Sautr\u0101ntikas. [[Dign\u0101ga]] and [[Dharmakirti|Dharmak\u012brti]] are the most prominent exponents. As opposed to Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, this view holds that we do not directly perceive the external world, only phenomenal forms caused by objects and our senses.<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\"/>\n\nThe other two tenets are [[Mahayana]]:\n* [[Yogacara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]], also called ''Cittam\u0101tra''  \"Mind-Only\" ({{bo|w=sems-tsam-pa}}). Yogac\u0101rins base their views on texts from [[Maitreya]], [[Asanga|Asa\u1e45ga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]. Yogacara is often interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]].<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\"/> The system is entirely rejected by the Gelugpa, but elements of it form part of the teachings of the other schools.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=136}}\n* [[Madhyamaka]] ({{bo|w=dbu-ma-pa}}) - The philosophy of [[Nagarjuna|N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]] and [[Aryadeva|\u0100ryadeva]], which affirms that everything is empty of essence ([[svabhava]]) and is ultimately beyond concepts.<ref name=\"Kapstein 67\"/>\n\n:*[[Rangtong]], a term introduced by [[Dolpopa]], which rejects any inherent existing self or nature.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=146-147}} This includes:\n::* [[Svatantrika]]\n:::* Sautrantika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka - [[Bh\u0101viveka]]\n:::* Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka - [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]] and [[Kamala\u015b\u012bla]], the oldest Buddhist teachings to be introduced in Tibet{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=138}}\n::* [[Prasa\u1e45gika]], based on [[Buddhap\u0101lita]] and [[Candrak\u012brti]]. Within prasangika, a further division can be made:\n:::* Intellectual emptiness, which is realized by absolute denial. This is the view of Tsong Khapa and the Gelugpa school, which rejects any statements on an absolute reality beyond mere emptiness.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145}} \n:::* Experiential emptiness, which is realized when the understanding of intellectual emptiness gives way to the recognition of the true [[nature of mind]], c.q. [[rigpa]]. This is the view of Nyingma (Dzogchen) and Sakya.{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145}}\n:*[[Shentong]], systematised by Dolpopa, and based on [[Buddha-nature]] teachings and influenced by \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's Yogacara-Madhyamaka. It states that the [[nature of mind]] shines through when emptiness has been realized. This approach is dominant in the Jonang school, and can also be found in the Kagyu tradition.{{sfn|Hookam|1991}}{{sfn|Brunnh\u00f6lzl|2004}}{{sfn|Cornu|2001}}\n\nThe tenet systems are used in monasteries and colleges to teach Buddhist philosophy in a systematic and progressive fashion, each philosophical view being seen as more subtle than its predecessor. Therefore, the four tenets can be seen as a gradual path from a rather easy-to-grasp, \"realistic\" philosophical point of view, to more and more complex and subtle views on the ultimate nature of reality, culminating in the philosophy of the M\u0101dhyamikas, which is widely believed to present the most sophisticated point of view.<ref>Sopa & Hopkins (1977), 67-69; Hopkins (1996).</ref> Non-Tibetan scholars point out that historically, Madhyamaka predates Yogacara, however.<ref>Cf.

The Gelug school for example, use the works of [[Tsongkhapa]], while other schools may use the more recent work of [[Rim\u00e9 movement]] scholars like [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] and [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]].\n\nA corpus of extra-canonical scripture, the [[terma (religion)|treasure texts]] (''terma'') literature is acknowledged by [[Nyingma]] practitioners, but the bulk of the canon that is not commentary was translated from Indian sources. True to its roots in the ''P\u0101la'' system of North India, however, Tibetan Buddhism carries on a tradition of eclectic accumulation and systematisation of diverse Buddhist elements, and pursues their synthesis. Prominent among these achievements have been the [[lamrim|Stages of the Path]] and [[lojong|mind training]] literature, both stemming from teachings by the Indian scholar [[Ati\u015ba]].\n\n===Tantric literature===\n{{Main|Tantras (Buddhism)}}\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the Buddhist Tantras are divided into four or six categories, with several sub-categories for the highest Tantras.\n\nIn the Nyingma, the division is into ''Outer Tantras'' ([[Kriyayoga]], [[Charyayoga]], [[Yogatantra]]); and ''Inner Tantras'' ([[Mahayoga]], [[Anuyoga]], [[Atiyoga]] (Tib. [[Dzogchen]])), which correspond to the \"Anuttarayogatantra\".<ref>\"Yoginitantras are in the secondary literature often called Anuttarayoga. But this is based on a mistaken back translation of the Tibetan translation (rnal byor bla med kyi rgyud) of what appears in Sanskrit texts only as Yog\u0101nuttara or Yoganiruttara (cf. SANDERSON 1994: 97-98, fn.1).\"\n\nIsabelle Onians, \"Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm,\" D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001. pg 70\n</ref> For the Nyingma school, important tantras include the [[Guhyagarbha tantra]], the [[Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra|Guhyasamaja tantra]],<ref name=\":2\">Samuel 2012, p. 32.</ref> the [[Kulayar\u0101ja Tantra]] and the 17 [[Seventeen tantras|Dzogchen tantras]].\n\nIn the Sarma schools, the division is:<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 78.</ref>\n\n* Kriyayoga - These have an emphasis on purification and ritual acts and include texts like the [[Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa|''Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012bm\u016blakalpa'']].\n* Charyayoga - Contain \"a balance between external activities and internal practices\", mainly referring to the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra|Mah\u0101vairocana Abhisa\u1e43bodhi Tantra]].''\n* Yogatantra, is mainly concerned with internal yogic techniques and includes the ''[[Tattvasa\u1e43graha Tantra]].''\n* [[Anuttarayoga Tantra|Anuttarayogatantra]], contains more advanced techniques such as [[subtle body]] practices and is subdivided into: \n**Mother class tantras, which emphasize illusory body and [[Deity yoga|completion stage]] practices and includes the [[Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra|Guhyasamaja tantra]] and Yamantaka tantra.\n**Father class, which emphasize the development stage and [[Luminous mind|clear light mind]] and includes the [[Hevajra Tantra]] and [[Cakrasa\u1e43vara Tantra|Cakrasamvara Tantra]].\n**Non-dual class, which balance the above elements, and mainly refers to the [[Kalacakra|Kalacakra tantra]]\n\nIt is important to note that the root tantras themselves are almost unintelligible without the various Indian and Tibetan commentaries, therefore, they are never studied without the use of the tantric commentarial apparatus.\n\n===Transmission and realization===\nThere is a long history of [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]] of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of a [[Mantra#Mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism|mantra]], for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]]). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in [[Asanga]]'s visions of [[Maitreya]].\n\nAn emphasis on oral transmission as more important than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them.<ref>Conze (1993): 26</ref> Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha in the case of a ''[[S\u016btra|sutra]]'' or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.\n\n==Practices==\n{{See also|Tantra techniques (Vajrayana)}}In Tibetan Buddhism, practices are generally classified as either Sutra (or ''P\u0101ramit\u0101y\u0101na'') or Tantra (''Vajray\u0101na or Mantray\u0101na''), though exactly what constitutes each category and what is included and excluded in each is a matter of debate and differs among the various lineages. According to [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] for example, what separates Tantra from Sutra is the practice of [[Deity yoga]].<ref>Powers 2007, p. 271.</ref>\n\nWhile it is generally held that the practices of Vajray\u0101na are not included in Sutray\u0101na, all Sutray\u0101na practices are common to Vajray\u0101na practice. Traditionally, Vajray\u0101na is held to be a more powerful and effective path, but potentially more difficult and dangerous and thus they should only be undertaken by the advanced who have established a solid basis in other practices.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 50.</ref>\n\n=== P\u0101ramit\u0101 ===\n{{Main|Paramitas}}\nThe [[paramitas|''P\u0101ramit\u0101s'']] (perfections, transcendent virtues) is a key set of virtues which constitute the major practices of a bodhisattva in non-tantric Mahayana. They are:\n\n#''[[D\u0101na]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'': generosity, giving of oneself (Tibetan: \u0f66\u0f56\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f54 ''sbyin-pa'')\n#''[[\u015a\u012bla]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (\u0f5a\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f58\u0f66 ''tshul-khrims'')\n#''[[Kshanti|{{IAST|K\u1e63\u0101nti}}]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (\u0f56\u0f5f\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54 ''bzod-pa'')\n#''[[V\u012brya]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : energy, diligence, vigor, effort (\u0f56\u0f62\u0fa9\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b\u0f60\u0f42\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f66 ''brtson-\u2019grus'')\n#''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|Dhy\u0101na]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : one-pointed concentration, contemplation (\u0f56\u0f66\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f4f\u0f53 ''bsam-gtan'')\n#''[[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]] p\u0101ramit\u0101'' : wisdom, insight (\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f56 ''shes-rab'')\n\nThe practice of ''D\u0101na'' (giving) while traditionally referring to offerings of food to the monastics can also refer to the ritual offering of bowls of water, incense, butter lamps and flowers to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on a shrine or household altar.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 45-46.</ref> Similar offerings are also given to other beings such as hungry ghosts, [[dakinis]], protector deities, local divinities etc.\n\nLike other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of the [[five precepts]] and [[Bodhisattva vow]]s is part of Tibetan Buddhist moral (''sila'') practice. In addition to these, there are also numerous sets of Tantric vows, termed [[Samaya]], which are given as part of Tantric initiations.\n\nCompassion (''[[karu\u1e47\u0101]]'') practices are also particularly important in Tibetan Buddhism. One of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the ''[[Bodhisattvacary\u0101vat\u0101ra]]'' by [[Shantideva]]. In the eighth section entitled ''Meditative Concentration'', Shantideva describes meditation on Karun\u0101 as thus:\n\n{{quote|Strive at first to meditate upon the sameness of yourself and others. In joy and sorrow all are equal; Thus be guardian of all, as of yourself. The hand and other limbs are many and distinct, But all are one--the body to kept and guarded. Likewise, different beings, in their joys and sorrows, are, like me, all one in wanting happiness. This pain of mine does not afflict or cause discomfort to another's body, and yet this pain is hard for me to bear because I cling and take it for my own. And other beings' pain I do not feel, and yet, because I take them for myself, their suffering is mine and therefore hard to bear. And therefore I'll dispel the pain of others, for it is simply pain, just like my own.  And others I will aid and benefit, for they are living beings, like my body. Since I and other beings both, in wanting happiness, are equal and alike, what difference is there to distinguish us, that I should strive to have my bliss alone?\"<ref>''The Way of the Bodhisattva'' by Shantideva.  Shambhala Publications.  Page 122-123</ref>}}\n\nA popular compassion meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is ''[[Tonglen]]'' (sending and taking love and suffering respectively). Practices associated with [[Avalokite\u015bvara|Chenrezig]] (Avalokiteshvara), also tend to focus on compassion.\n\n===Samatha and Vipa\u015byan\u0101===\n[[File:Young monk in meditation cell, Yerpa, Tibet. 1993.jpg|thumb|Young monk in meditation retreat, [[Yerpa]], [[Tibet]] in 1993]]\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] defines meditation (''bsgom pa'') as \"familiarization of the mind with an object of meditation.\"<ref>Powers 2007, p. 81.</ref> Traditionally, Tibetan Buddhism follows the two main approaches to [[meditation]] or mental cultivation (''[[bhavana]]'') as taught in all forms of Buddhism, [[\u015bamatha]] (Tib. ''Shine'') and [[vipa\u015byan\u0101]] (''lhaktong'').\n\nThe practice of [[\u015bamatha]] (calm abiding) is one of focusing one's mind on a single object such as a Buddha figure or the breath. Through repeated practice one's mind gradually becomes more stable, calm and happy. It is defined by [[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal|Takpo Tashi Namgyal]] as \"fixing the mind upon any object so as to maintain it without distraction...focusing the mind on an object and maintaining it in that state until finally it is channeled into one stream of attention and evenness.\"<ref>Powers 2007, p. 86.</ref> The [[Samatha#Nine mental abidings|nine mental abidings]] is the main progressive framework used for \u015bamatha in Tibetan Buddhism.<ref>Powers 2007, p. 88.</ref> Once a meditator has reached the ninth level of this schema they achieve what is termed \"pliancy\" (Tib. ''shin tu sbyangs pa'', Skt. ''[[Pra\u015brabdhi|prasrabdhi]]''), defined as \"a serviceability of mind and body such that the mind can be set on a virtuous object of observation as long as one likes; it has the function of removing all obstructions.\" This is also said to be very joyful and blissful for the body and the mind.<ref>Powers 2007, p. 90.</ref>\n\nThe other form of Buddhist meditation is [[vipa\u015byan\u0101]] (clear seeing, higher insight), which in Tibetan Buddhism is generally practiced after having attained proficiency in [[\u015bamatha]].<ref>Powers 2007, p. 91.</ref> This is generally seen as having two aspects, one of which is [[Vipassan\u0101#Inductive and deductive analysis in the Indo-Tibetan tradition|analytic meditation]], thinking rationally about ideas and concepts in a scholarly or philosophical manner. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions.{{sfn|khri byang blo bzang ye shes bstan \u02bcdzin rgya mtsho|2006|p=66, 212f}} The other type of [[vipa\u015byan\u0101]]  is a non-analytical, \"simple\" yogic style called ''tr\u00f6meh'' in Tibetan, which means \"without complication\".<ref>''The Practice of Tranquillity & Insight: A Guide to Tibetan Buddhist Meditation'' by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. Shambhala Publications: 1994. {{ISBN|0-87773-943-9}} pg 91-93</ref>\n\nA meditation routine may involve alternating sessions of vipa\u015byan\u0101 to achieve deeper levels of realization, and samatha to consolidate them.<ref name=\"Hopkins 1996\" />\n\n===Preliminary practices===\n{{see also|Ng\u00f6ndro}}\n[[File:Mongol praying at a shrine in urga.jpg|thumb|Buddhist praying at a shrine in [[Ulaanbaatar|urga]].]]\n[[File:IMG_1016_Lhasa_Barkhor.jpg|thumb|Buddhists performing prostrations in front of [[Jokhang Monastery]].]]\n\n[[Vajray\u0101na]] is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be the fastest method for attaining Buddhahood but for unqualified practitioners it can be dangerous.<ref>Pabonka, p.649</ref> To engage in it one must receive an appropriate initiation (also known as an \"empowerment\") from a lama who is fully qualified to give it. The aim of [[ng\u00f6ndro|preliminary practices]] (''ng\u00f6ndro'') is to start the student on the correct path for such higher teachings.<ref>Kalu Rinpoche (1986), ''The Gem Ornament of Manifold Instructions''. Snow Lion, p. 21.</ref> Just as Sutray\u0101na preceded Vajray\u0101na historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones. Preliminary practices include all ''Sutray\u0101na'' activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principle stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic [[bodhicitta]] wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without the basis of these three in particular to practice Vajray\u0101na can be like a small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.<ref>[[Pabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo]], 649</ref>\n\nThe most widespread preliminary practices include: taking [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]], [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostration]], [[Vajrasattva]] meditation, mandala offering and [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]].<ref>Powers 2007, p. 295.</ref>\n\nThe merit acquired in the preliminary practices facilitates progress in Vajray\u0101na. While many Buddhists may spend a lifetime exclusively on sutra practices, however, an amalgam of the two to some degree is common. For example, in order to train in [[calm abiding]], one might use a tantric visualisation as the meditation object.\n\n====Guru yoga====\n{{see also|Guru#In_Buddhism|label 1=Guru in Buddhism}}\n\nAs in other Buddhist traditions, an attitude of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized.<ref>''Lama'' is the literal Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit ''guru''. For a traditional perspective on devotion to the guru, see Tsong-ka-pa I, 77-87. For a current perspective on the guru-disciple relationship in Tibetan Buddhism, see [http://studybuddhism.com/web/x/nav/group.html_1305527811.html Berzin, Alexander. ''Relating to a Spiritual Teacher: Building a Healthy Relationship'']</ref> At the beginning of a public teaching, a ''[[lama]]'' will do [[prostration]]s to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources.<ref>notably, ''Gurupancasika'', Tib.: ''Lama Ngachupa'', Wylie: ''bla-ma lnga-bcu-pa'', \"Fifty Verses of Guru-Devotion\" by [[A\u015bvagho\u1e63a]]</ref> By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.\n\nThere is a general sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a ''lama''. A student may have taken teachings from many authorities and revere them all as ''lamas'' in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru.<ref>Indian tradition (Cf. ''Saddharmapundarika Sutra'' II, 124) encourages the student to view the guru as representative of the Buddha himself.</ref>\n\nOne particular feature of the Tantric view of teacher student relationship is that in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, one is instructed to regard one's guru as an awakened Buddha.<ref name=\"Kapstein 80\" />\n\n===Esotericism and vows===\n[[File:Sand mandala. Drongste Gompa 1993.JPG|thumb|A [[sand mandala]]]]\nIn Vajray\u0101na particularly, Tibetan Buddhists subscribe to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated do not seek and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a [[Mandalas|mandala]] may be less public than that of a deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajray\u0101na is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.\n\nBuddhism has always had a taste for [[esotericism]] since its earliest period in India.<ref>Cf. Conze (1993), 26 and 52f.</ref> Tibetans today maintain greater or lesser degrees of confidentiality also with information on the ''[[vinaya]]'' and [[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|emptiness]] specifically. In Buddhist teachings generally, too, there is caution about revealing information to people who may be unready for it.\n\nPracticing tantra also includes the maintaining of a separate set of vows, which are called ''[[Samaya]] (dam tshig)''. There are various lists of these and they may differ depending on the practice and one's lineage or individual guru. Upholding these vows is said to be essential for tantric practice and breaking them is said to cause great harm.<ref>Powers 2007, p. 315.</ref>[[File:Ritual musical instruments in Tibet - MIM Brussels (2015-05-30 07.00.30 by chibicode).jpg|thumb|right|Ritual musical instruments from Tibet; MIM Brussels.]]\n\n===Rites and rituals===\n[[File:Chenrezig empowerment seattle sakya.jpg|thumb|right|The reading of the text - the 'lung' - during an empowerment for [[Chenrezig]].]]\nThere has been a \"close association\" between the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the temporal<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cueppers|first=Christoph|title=The Relationship Between Religion and State (chos srid zung 'brel) In Traditional Tibet|url=https://www.academia.edu/2262393|language=en}}</ref> in Tibet. The term for this relationship is ''chos srid zung 'brel.'' Traditionally Tibetan lamas have tended to the lay populace by helping them with issues such as protection and prosperity. Common traditions have been the various rites and rituals for mundane ends, such as purifying one's karma, avoiding harm from demonic forces and enemies, and promoting a successful harvest.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T.

These rituals consecrate a practitioner into a particular Tantric practice associated with individual mandalas of deities and mantras. Without having gone through initiation, one is generally not allowed to practice the higher Tantras.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 81.</ref>\n\nAnother important ritual occasion in Tibetan Buddhism is that of [[Funeral|mortuary rituals]] which are supposed to assure that one has a positive rebirth and a good spiritual path in the future.<ref name=\"Kapstein 94\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 94.</ref> Of central importance to Tibetan Buddhist ''[[Ars moriendi]]'' is the idea of the [[Bardo]] (Sanskrit: ''antar\u0101bhava''), the intermediate or liminal state between life and death.<ref name=\"Kapstein 94\"/> Rituals and the readings of texts such as the [[Bardo Thodol]] are done to ensure that the dying person can navigate this intermediate state skillfully. [[Cremation]] and [[sky burial]] are traditionally the main [[funeral]] rites used to dispose of the body.<ref name=\"Kapstein, Matthew T. 2014, p. 100\"/>\n\n===Mantra===\n[[File:IMG 0996 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|An elderly [[Tibet]]an woman with a [[prayer wheel]] inscribed with mantras]]\nThe use of (mainly [[Sanskrit]]) prayer formulas, incantations or phrases called [[mantras]] (Tibetan: ''sngags'') is another widespread feature of Tibetan Buddhist practice.<ref name=\"Kapstein 80\">Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 80.</ref> So common is the use of mantras that [[Vajrayana]] is also sometimes called \"''Mantray\u0101na''\" (the mantra vehicle). Mantras are widely recited, chanted, written or inscribed, and visualized as part of different forms of meditation. Each mantra has symbolic meaning and will often have a connection to a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 23-24</ref> Each deity's mantra is seen as symbolizing the function, speech and power of the deity.<ref>Samuel, Geoffrey. Introducing Tibetan Buddhism (World Religions), 2012, p. 74</ref> Tibetan Buddhist practitioners repeat mantras in order to train the mind, and transform their thoughts in line with the divine qualities of the mantra's deity and special power.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 265</ref>\n\nTibetan Buddhists see the etymology of the term mantra as meaning \"mind protector\", and mantras is seen as a way to guard the mind against negativity.<ref>Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr. The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism</ref> According to [[Lama Zopa Rinpoche]]:\n\n<blockquote>Mantras are effective because they help keep your mind quiet and peaceful,  automatically integrating it into one-pointedness.  They make your mind receptive to very subtle vibrations and thereby heighten your perception. Their recitation eradicates gross negativities and the true nature of things can then be reflected in your mind\u2019s resulting clarity. By practising a transcendental mantra, you can in fact purify all the defiled energy of your body, speech, and mind.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 266-67</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nMantras also serve to focus the mind as a [[samatha]] (calming) practice as well as a way to transform the mind through the symbolic meaning of the mantra. In Buddhism, it is important to have the proper intention, focus and faith when practicing mantras, if one does not, they will not work. Unlike in Hinduism, mantras are not believed to have inherent power of their own, and thus without the proper faith, intention and mental focus, they are just mere sounds.<ref>Powers, John; Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, page 267</ref> Thus according to the Tibetan philosopher [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Jamgon Ju Mipham]]:\n\n<blockquote>if a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like non-conceptual wish-fulfilling jewels. Infusing one's being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon reflected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon's reflection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one's being.<ref>Jamgon Mipham, Luminous Essence: A Guide to the Guhyagarbha Tantra, page 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMantras are part of the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism, such as [[Deity Yoga]] and are recited and visualized during tantric [[sadhana]]s. Thus, [[Tsongkhapa]] says that mantra \"protects the mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions\".<ref>Tso\u1e45-kha-pa Blo-bza\u1e45-grags-pa. Tantra in Tibet: The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1987, page 47.</ref> This is because in Tibetan Buddhist Tantric praxis, one must develop a sense that everything is divine.\n\n===Tantric Yoga===\n{{See also|Deity yoga}}\n[[File:Ch\u00f6d practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Ch\u00f6d]] ritual, note the use of [[Damaru]] drum and hand-bell, as well as the [[Kangling]] (thighbone trumpet).]]\nIn what is called ''[[Anuttarayoga tantra|higher yoga tantra]]'' the emphasis is on various yoga practices which allow the practitioner to realize the true nature of reality.<ref name=\"Kapstein 83\"/>\n\n''[[Deity Yoga]]'' (Tibetan: ''lha'i rnal 'byor''; Sanskrit: ''Devata-yoga'') is a fundamental practice of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] involving [[mental image|visualization of mental image]]s consisting mainly of [[Buddhist deities]] such as Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and [[fierce deities]], along mantra repetition. According to Geoffrey Samuel: <blockquote>If Buddhahood is a source of infinite potentiality accessible at any time, then the Tantric deities are in a sense partial aspects, refractions of that total potentiality. Visualizing one of these deities, or oneself identifying with one of them, is not, in Tibetan Tantric thought, a technique to worship an external entity. Rather, it is a way of accessing or tuning into something that is an intrinsic part of the structure of the universe \u2014 as of course is the practitioner him or herself.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 71.</ref></blockquote>Deity yoga involves two stages, the '''generation stage''' and the '''completion stage'''. In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity (''[[yidam]]''), its [[mandala]] and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality.<ref>Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 52</ref> In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of [[sunyata]] or emptiness.\n\nCompletion stage practices can also include [[subtle body]] energy practices,<ref>Garson, Nathaniel DeWitt; Penetrating the Secret Essence Tantra: Context and Philosophy in the Mahayoga System of rNying-ma Tantra, 2004, p. 45</ref> as well as other practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].\n\nThe views and practices associated with [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] are often seen as the culmination of the tantric path.<ref>Kapstein, Matthew T. ''Tibetan Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction''.

According to Geoffrey Samuel this is where \"religious leadership in Tibetan Buddhism contrasts most strongly with much of the rest of the Buddhist world.\"<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 130.</ref> Lamas are generally skilled and experienced tantric practitioners and ritual specialists in a specific initiation lineage and may be laypersons or monastics. They act not just as teachers, but as spiritual guides and guardians of the lineage teachings that they have received through a long and intimate process of apprenticeship with their Lamas.<ref>Samuel 2012, pp. 131-134.</ref>\n\nTibetan Buddhism also includes a number of [[lay clergy]] and lay tantric specialists, such as [[Ngagpa|''Ngagpas'']] (Skt. ''mantr\u012b''), ''Gomchens'', ''Serkyims'', and ''Ch\u00f6dpas'' (practitioners of [[Ch\u00f6d]]). According to Samuel, in the more remote parts of the Himalayas, communities were often led by lay religious specialists.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 141.</ref> Thus, while the large monastic institutions were present in the regions of the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan plateau]] which were more centralized politically, in other regions they were absent and instead smaller [[Gompa|''gompas'']] and more lay oriented communities prevailed.<ref>Samuel 2012 p. 158.</ref>\n\nSamuel outlines four main types of religious communities in Tibet:<ref>Samuel 2012 pp. 159-162.</ref>\n\n* Small communities of lay practitioners attached to a temple and a lama. Lay practitioners might stay in the ''gompa'' for periodic retreats.\n* Small communities of celibate monastics attached to a temple and a lama, often part of a village.\n* Medium to large communities of celibate monastics. These could maintain several hundred monks and might have extensive land holdings, be financially independent, and sometimes also act as trading centers.\n* Large teaching monasteries with thousands of monks, such as the big Gelug establishments of [[Sera Monastery|Sera]] (with over 6000 monks in the first half of the 20th century) and [[Drepung Monastery|Drepung]] (over 7000).<ref>Chapman F. Spencer. ''Lhasa the Holy City'', p. 195. Readers Union Ltd., London.</ref>\n\nIn some cases a lama is the leader of a spiritual community. Some lamas gain their title through being part of particular family which maintains a lineage of hereditary lamas (and are thus often laypersons). One example is the Sakya family of Kon, who founded the [[Sakya]] school and another is the hereditary lamas of [[Mindrolling Monastery|Mindrolling monastery]].<ref>Samuel 2012, pp. 140-141.</ref>\n\nIn other cases, lamas may be seen as \"[[Tulku|T\u00fclkus\"]] (\"incarnations\"). [[Tulku|T\u00fclkus]] are figures which are recognized as reincarnations of a particular bodhisattva or a previous religious figure. They are often recognized from a young age through the use of [[divination]] and the use of the possessions of the deceased lama, and therefore are able to receive extensive training. They are sometimes groomed to become leaders of monastic institutions.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 146.</ref> Examples include the [[Dalai Lamas]] and the [[Karmapa]]s, each of which are seen as key leaders in their respective traditions.\n\nThe system of [[Tulku|incarnate lamas]] is popularly held to be a Tibetan alteration to Indian Buddhism.\n\nAnother title unique to Tibetan Buddhism is that of [[Tert\u00f6n]] (treasure discoverer), who are considered capable of revealing or discovering special revelations or texts called [[Terma (religion)|Termas]] (lit. \"hidden treasure\"). They are also associated with the idea of ''[[beyul]]'' (\"hidden valleys\"), which are power places associated with deities and hidden religious treasures.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 144.</ref><br />\n\n===Women in Tibetan Buddhism===\n{{further|Women in Buddhism|Ordination of women in Buddhism}}\n[[File:Machik Labdron.jpg|thumb|[[Machig Labdr\u00f6n]], a famous female tantrika, teacher and founder of the [[Ch\u00f6d]] lineage]]\n[[File:Ayu-khandro.jpg|thumb|Painting of Ayu Khandro at Merigar West. The seat of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and The Dzogchen Community in Italy.]]\nWomen in Tibetan society, though still unequal, tended to have a relatively greater autonomy and power than in surrounding societies. This might be because of the smaller household sizes and low population density in Tibet.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 206.</ref>  Women traditionally took many roles in Tibetan Buddhism, from lay supporters, to monastics, lamas and tantric practitioners.\n\nThere is evidence for the importance of female practitioners in Indian Tantric Buddhism and pre-modern Tibetan Buddhism. At least one major lineage of tantric teachings, the [[Shangpa Kagyu]], traces itself to Indian female teachers and there have been a series of important female Tibetan teachers, such as [[Yeshe Tsogyal]] and [[Machig Labdr\u00f6n]].<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 214.</ref> It seems that even though it might have been more difficult for women to become serious tantric yoginis, it was still possible for them to find lamas that would teach them high tantric practices.\n\nSome Tibetan women become lamas by being born in one of the hereditary lama families such as [[Khandro Rinpoche|Mindrolling Jets\u00fcn Khandro Rinpoche]] and Sakya Jets\u00fcn Kushok Chimey Luding.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 216.</ref> There have also been cases of influential female lamas who were also tert\u00f6ns, such as [[Kunzang Dekyong Wangmo|Sera Khandro]], [[Tare Lhamo]] and [[Ayu Khandro]].\n\nSome of these figures were also tantric consorts (''sangyum, kandroma'') with male lamas, and thus took part in the sexual practices associated with the highest levels of tantric practice.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 215.</ref>\n\n==== Nuns ====\nWhile monasticism is practiced there by women, it is much less common (2 percent of the population in the 20th century compared to 12 percent of men). Nuns were also much less respected by Tibetan society than monks and may receive less lay support than male monastics.<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 211.</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Tibetan Buddhist nuns were also not \"fully ordained\" as [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs]] (who take the full set of monastic vows in the [[Vinaya]]). When Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs]] required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet.{{sfn|Tsomo|1999|p=22}}{{refn|group=note|Under the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya, as with the two other extant Vinaya lineages today ([[Theravada]] and [[Dharmaguptaka]]), in order to ordain bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs, there must be quorums of both bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs ''and'' bhik\u1e63us; without both, a woman cannot be ordained as a nun ({{bo|t=\u0f51\u0f42\u0f7a\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fb3\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f0b|s=g\u00e9longma}}).}} Despite an absence of ordination there, bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012bs did travel to Tibet.

In Dharamsala, he encouraged, \"We need to bring this to a conclusion. We Tibetans alone can't decide this. Rather, it should be decided in collaboration with Buddhists from all over the world. Speaking in general terms, were the Buddha to come to this 21st century world, I feel that most likely, seeing the actual situation in the world now, he might change the rules somewhat....\"\n#Later, in [[Z\u00fcrich]] during a 2005 conference of Tibetan Buddhist Centers, he said, \"Now I think the time has come; we should start a working group or committee\" to meet with monks from other Buddhist traditions. Looking at the German bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b [[Jampa Tsedroen]], he instructed, \"I prefer that Western Buddhist nuns carry out this work\u2026 Go to different places for further research and discuss with senior monks (from various Buddhist countries). I think, first, senior bhikshunis need to correct the monks' way of thinking.\n#\"This is the 21st century. Everywhere we are talking about equality\u2026.Basically Buddhism needs equality. There are some really minor things to remember as a Buddhist--a bhikshu always goes first, then a bhikshuni\u2026.The key thing is the restoration of the bhikshuni vow.\"\n\n[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] referred to the Dalai Lama having said on occasion of the 2007 Hamburg congress:\n{{quote|Sometimes in religion there has been an emphasis on male importance. In Buddhism, however, the highest vows, namely the bhikshu and bhikshuni ones, are equal and entail the same rights. This is the case despite the fact that in some ritual areas, due to social custom, bhikshus go first. But Buddha gave the basic rights equally to both sangha groups. There is no point in discussing whether or not to revive the bhikshuni ordination; the question is merely how to do so properly within the context of the Vinaya.<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com 2\">[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34 Human Rights and the Status of Women in Buddhism]</ref>}}}}\n\n====Western nuns and lamas====\nBuddhist author Michaela Haas notes that Tibetan Buddhism is undergoing a sea change in the West, with women playing a much more central role.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michaela-haas/female-dalai-lama-why-it-matters_b_2982005.html|title=A Female Dalai Lama?

One of the most influential terma cycles is the [[Longchen Nyingthig]] which was revealed by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730\u20131798).\n\n====Sakya====\n{{Main|Sakya}}\n[[File:Sakya Pandita.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sakya Pandita]]]]\nThe \"Grey Earth\" school represents one of the first ''Sarma'' (new translation) scholarly traditions. Headed by the [[Sakya Trizin]], this tradition was founded by Kh\u00f6n K\u00f6nchok Gyelpo ({{bo|w='khon dkon mchog rgyal po}}, 1034\u20131102), a disciple of the great [[Lotsawa]], Drogmi Sh\u0101kya ({{bo|w=brog mi lo ts\u0101 wa ye shes}}) and traces its lineage to the [[mahasiddha]] Vir\u016bpa.<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com\"/> A renowned exponent, [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182\u20131251CE), was the great-grandson of Kh\u00f6n K\u00f6nchok Gyelpo.\nSakyapa, the last one, was named because of the Sakya Monastery, of which the wall was painted into Red, White, and Cyan.\n\n====Bodong====\nThe [[Bodongpa|Bodong]] school is one of the minor schools, being much smaller and less influential than the four main schools. This tradition was founded in 1049 by the Kadam teacher Mudra Chenpo, who also established the Bodong E Monastery. Its most famous teacher was Bodong Penchen L\u00e9nam Gyelchok (1376-1451) who authored over one hundred and thirty-five volumes.\n\nThis tradition is also known for maintaining a female tulku lineage of incarnated lamas called the [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]].\n\n====Kagyu====\n{{Main|Kagyu}}\n[[File:Bhutanese_painted_thanka_of_Milarepa_(1052-1135),_Late_19th-early_20th_Century,_Dhodeydrag_Gonpa,_Thimphu,_Bhutan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Milarepa]]]]\n\nKagyu means \"oral transmission\" and consists of a series of lineages which all trace themselves back to Indian [[mahasiddha]]s like [[Saraha]] and [[Tilopa]]. Its most famous Tibetan exponent was [[Milarepa]], an 11th-century mystic. It is often divided into the larger [[Dagpo Kagyu]] and the smaller Shangpa Kagyu lineage\n\nThe Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master [[Naropa]] via [[Marpa Lotsawa]], Milarepa and [[Gampopa]]<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com\" /> and consists of four major sub-sects: the [[Karma Kagyu]], headed by a [[Karmapa]], the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu's founder, [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]]. The most notable of these are the [[Drikung Kagyu|Drikung]] and [[Drukpa Lineage]]s.\n\nThe once-obscure [[Shangpa Kagyu]], which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher [[Kalu Rinpoche]], traces its history back to the Indian female siddhas [[Niguma]] and [[Sukhasiddhi]], transmitted to Tibet via [[Khyungpo Naljor]] in the 11th century.<ref name=\"StudyBuddhism.com\" />\n\n====Jonang====\n{{Main|Jonang}}\nThe Jonang is a minor school which can be traced to early 12th century master [[Yumo Mikyo Dorje]], but was popularized by the influential master [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|D\u00f6lpopa Sh\u00e9rap Gyeltsen]] (1292\u20131361).\n\nThe Jonang re-established their religio-political center in [[Golok people|Golok]], [[Nakhi people|Nakhi]] and [[Mongols|Mongol]] areas in [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] centered at [[Dzamthang Monastery]] and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. The tradition was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.\n\nHowever, their teachings were limited to these regions until the [[Rim\u00e9 movement]] of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice.<ref name=Gruschke>Gruschke 2001, p.72; and A.

Tibetan Studies I'' (Proceedings of the Ninth Seminar of The IATS, 2000), Brill Academic Publishers, Leiden 2002, pp. 183-214</ref> In modern times it has been encouraged to grow by the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who installed the [[9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] as its head.\n\n====Gelug====\n{{Main|Gelug}}\n[[File:Ganden_monastery,_2013.jpg|thumb|[[Ganden monastery]], Tibet, 2013]]\nThe \"Way of Virtue\" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa]], renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. He was a prominent supporter of the [[Madhyamika]] philosophy and formalized the [[Svatantrika-Prasa\u1e45gika distinction]]. Its spiritual head is the [[Ganden Tripa]] and its temporal one the [[Dalai Lama]]. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the embodiment of [[Avalokite\u015bvara]]. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas ruled [[Tibet]] from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.\nGelugpa is the youngest but largest sect of Tibetan Buddhism. People also call it the Yellow Sect due to the hat they wear is yellow color. The founder of Gelugpa is Tsongkhapa, a great master. The discipline of Gelugpa is very strict. Followers could not get married, could not eat meat, could not drink alcoholic beverages. Most of the famous monasteries in Tibet admire Gelugpa, such as Ganden Monastery, Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery in Lhasa, and Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse.\n\n==== Yungdrung Bon ====\nWhile [[Bon|Yungdrung Bon]] considers itself a separate religion with pre-Buddhist origins, and it is considered as non-Buddhist by the main Tibetan traditions, it shares so many similarities and practices with mainstream Tibetan Buddhism that some scholars such as Geoffrey Samuel see it as \"essentially a variant of Tibetan Buddhism\".<ref>Samuel 2012, p. 232.</ref> It is much more related to Nyingma Buddhism, and includes [[Dzogchen]] teachings, similar deities, rituals and forms of monasticism.<br />\n\n== Glossary of terms used ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"750\"\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''English'''\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''spoken Tibetan'''\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''Wylie Tibetan'''\n!align=\"center\" width=\"120\"|'''Sanskrit transliteration'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |affliction\n|align=\"center\" |ny\u00f6nmong\n|align=\"center\" |nyon-mongs\n|align=\"center\" |kle\u015ba\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |analytic meditation\n|align=\"center\" |jegom\n|align=\"center\" |dpyad-sgom\n|align=\"center\" |yauktika dhy\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |calm abiding\n|align=\"center\" |shin\u00e9\n|align=\"center\" |zhi-gnas\n|align=\"center\" |\u015bamatha\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |devotion to the guru\n|align=\"center\" |lama-la tenpa\n|align=\"center\" |bla-ma-la bsten-pa\n|align=\"center\" |guruparyup\u0101sati\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |fixation meditation\n|align=\"center\" |joggom\n|align=\"center\" |'jog-sgom\n|align=\"center\" |nibandhita dhy\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |foundational vehicle\n|align=\"center\" |t\u2019ek m\u00e4n\n|align=\"center\" |theg sman\n|align=\"center\" |h\u012bnay\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |incarnate lama\n|align=\"center\" |t\u00fclku\n|align=\"center\" |sprul-sku\n|align=\"center\" |nirm\u0101nak\u0101ya\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |inherent existence\n|align=\"center\" |rangzhingi drubpa\n|align=\"center\" |rang-bzhin-gyi grub-pa\n|align=\"center\" |svabh\u0101vasiddha\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |mind of enlightenment\n|align=\"center\" |changchub sem\n|align=\"center\" |byang-chhub sems\n|align=\"center\" |bodhicitta\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |motivational training\n|align=\"center\" |lojong\n|align=\"center\" |blo-sbyong\n|align=\"center\" |autsukya dhy\u0101na\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |omniscience\n|align=\"center\" |t\u2019amc\u00e9 k\u2019yempa\n|align=\"center\" |thams-cad mkhyen-pa\n|align=\"center\" |sarvaj\u00f1a\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |preliminary practices\n|align=\"center\" |ng\u00f6ndro\n|align=\"center\" |sngon-'gro\n|align=\"center\" |pr\u0101rambhika kriy\u0101ni\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |root guru\n|align=\"center\" |zaw\u00e9 lama\n|align=\"center\" |rtsa-ba'i bla-ma\n|align=\"center\" |m\u016blaguru\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |stages of the path\n|align=\"center\" |lamrim\n|align=\"center\" |lam-rim\n|align=\"center\" |p\u0101theya\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |transmission and realisation\n|align=\"center\" |lungtok\n|align=\"center\" |lung-rtogs\n|align=\"center\" |\u0101gam\u0101dhigama\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col}}<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n*[[Buddhism in Sri Lanka]]\n*[[Buddhist deities]]\n*[[Chinese Buddhism]]\n*[[Chinese Esoteric Buddhism]]\n*[[Death horoscopes in Tibetan Buddhism]]\n*[[Derge Parkhang]]\n*[[Fierce deities]]\n*[[History of Tibetan Buddhism]]\n*[[Karma in Tibetan Buddhism]]\n*[[Keydong Thuk-Che-Cho-Ling Nunnery]]\n*[[Mahamudra]]\n*[[Milarepa]]\n*[[Nagarjuna]]\n*[[Ngagpa]]\n*[[Padmasambhava]]\n*[[Pure Land Buddhism]] (Tibetan)\n*[[Samaya]]\n*[[Schools of Buddhism]]\n*[[Shambhala Buddhism]]\n*[[Songs of realization]]\n*[[Taklung Tangpa]]\n*[[Tibetan art]]\n*[[:Category:Tibetan Buddhist teachers|Tibetan Buddhist teachers (category)]]\n*[[Tibetan prayer flag]]\n*[[Tibetan prayer wheel]]\n*[[Traditional Tibetan medicine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- B -->\n* {{Citation | last = Brunnh\u00f6lzl  |first = Karl  |year = 2004 | title = The Center of the Sunlit Sky: Madhyamaka in the Kagyu Tradition  | publisher = Shambhala | isbn = 1-55939-218-5 }}\n<!-- C -->\n* Coleman, Graham, ed.

See also [[Glossary of baseball (G)#Grapefruit League|Grapefruit League]].\n\n===caddy===\n\n:A caddy's sole function is to come in as a substitute in the late innings of a lopsided game to act as a defensive replacement for an aging power hitter or to pinch run. Everything's false\n\n===called up===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Darren Clarke (baseball)]] -->\n\n:A Major League team may call up or promote a player from the minor leagues during the season to take a spot on its roster, often to replace a player who has been [[Glossary of baseball (S)#sent down|sent down]] to the minor leagues or else placed on the [[Glossary of baseball (D)#disabled list|disabled list]]. Players who have been in the major leagues previously (and were sent down) may be said to be '''recalled''' rather than called up. After August 31, several minor leaguers may be called up to take a spot on the [[Major League Baseball transactions#25-man, 40-man, and postseason rosters|expanded roster]].\n\n===cannon===\n\n:*A strong arm. Also, a '''gun'''.\n:*To throw strongly. Announcer following a play in which the shortstop fields a ground ball and throws hard to first: \"Guillen cannons and gets him.\"\n\n===can of corn===\n\n:A high, easy-to-catch, [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fly ball|fly ball]] hit to the outfield. The phrase is said to have originated in the nineteenth-century and relates to an old-time grocer's method of getting canned goods down from a high shelf. Using a stick with a hook on the end, a grocer could tip a can so it would fall for an easy catch into his apron. One theory for use of corn as the canned good in the phrase is that a can of corn was considered the easiest \"catch\" as corn was the best selling vegetable in the store and so was heavily stocked on the lowest shelves. Another theory is that the corn refers to the practice in the very early days of baseball of calling the outfield the \"corn field\", especially in early amateur baseball where the outfield may have been a farm field. Frequently used by [[Red Barber]], a variation, 'A #8 CAN OF GOLDEN BANTAM' was favored by [[Bob Prince]], Pittsburgh Pirates' announcer. The phrase was also used by Yankee announcer [[Phil Rizzuto]] and Red Sox and then White Sox broadcaster [[Ken Harrelson|Ken \"The Hawk\" Harrelson]]. Also, a phrase used to refer to something that is not challenging. Informally, can of corn may be used as a phrase to describe mild excitement, personal acknowledgement or recognition of significance.\n\n===Captain Hook===\n\n:A manager who often takes a pitcher out of the game at the first sign of trouble. [[Sparky Anderson]] was perhaps the best example of a \"Captain Hook\" at the major league level. See [[Glossary of baseball (H)#hook|hook]].\n\n===carve up===\n\n:When a pitcher quickly dispatches a batter with three or four pitches that the batter only whiffs at, the pitcher may be said to have \"carved up the batter\"&nbsp;\u2013 like a chef carving up a turkey. Headline: \"How [[Mark Buehrle|Buehrle]] carved up [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay]] with just one 90-m.p.h. pitch.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dailyherald.com/node/2317 |title=How Buehrle carved up Tampa Bay with just one 90-m.p.h. pitch &#124; DailyHerald.com Blogs |publisher=Blogs.dailyherald.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n===cash in===\n:To knock in a runner who is already on base. \"Lauren Rorebeck then cashed both runners in with a home run over the left field fence to tie the game at 7\u20137 with two innings to play.\"<ref>[http://newmanjets.com/news/2011/4/16/SB_0416114630.aspx Newman University April 16, 2011].</ref>\n\n===catbird seat===\n{{Main article|Catbird seat}}\n\n:A desirable or auspicious situation. Popularized by [[Red Barber]], longtime broadcaster for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. [[James Thurber]] wrote in his short story of the same title: ''\"[S]itting in the catbird seat\" means sitting pretty, like a batter with [[strike zone|three balls and no strikes]] on him.'' The [[Gray catbird|catbird]] is said to seek out the highest point in a tree to sing his song, so someone in the catbird seat is high up.\n\n===catch up to a fastball===\n\n:As if a batter were running a footrace with a fastball, he's said to \"catch up\" to a fastball if his reaction time and bat speed are quick enough to hit a fastball by a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#power pitcher|power pitcher]]. \"Our scouting reports indicate he can still hit and still catch up to a fastball.

In professional baseball, play continues and after continuous playing action ceases, the umpire calls time. The penalty is that the batter is awarded first base; any runner attempting to steal is awarded that base and all other runners advance only if forced. The manager of the offensive team has the option of keeping the result of the play. He will not be given the option by the umpires and must explicitly declare it before the play continues after awarding bases. The catcher is charged with an error. This is one of many types of [[Interference (baseball)|interference]] call.\n\n===caught looking===\n\n:From [http://open-site.org/Sports/Baseball/Terminology/C/Caught_Looking/ Open-site.org]: A term used when the third strike is called on a batter without the batter attempting to swing at the pitch.\n\n===caught napping===\n\n:A baserunner who is [[Glossary of baseball (T)#tag|tagged out]] because he wasn't paying attention to what the defensive players were doing is \"caught napping\". Often this involves a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pickoff|pickoff play]] in which the infielder sneaks up behind the runner and takes a throw from the pitcher or, less often, the catcher.\n\n===cellar===\n\n:Last place, bottom of the standings. A team that spends too much time in last place, especially over a stretch of years, tends to acquire the unflattering title of '''cellar dweller'''. SYNONYM: [[Glossary of baseball (B)#basement|basement]].\n\n===cement mixer===\n\n:A baseball pitched with the intent to break out of the strike zone that fails to break and ends up hanging in the strike zone; an unintentional slow fastball with side spin resembling a fixed-axis spinning cement mixer, which does not translate.\n\n===the chair===\n\n:Specifically regarding a batter: A seat on the bench, as opposed to reaching base or remaining in the batter's box. As in, \"throw him the chair\". The expression is an encouragement to the pitcher to strike out the batter, sending him back to the dugout, thus \"throwing him the chair\"&nbsp;\u2014 forcing him to sit down.\n\n===challenge the hitter===\n\n:When a pitcher is aggressive and throws strikes, perhaps his best fastball, he may be said to \"challenge the hitter\". Akin to [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pound the strike zone|pounding the strike zone]] or [[Glossary of baseball (A)#attack the strike zone|attacking the strike zone]]. \"Jared has outstanding stuff\", Mee said. \"The one thing I would like to see him do is throw more strikes and challenge the hitters.

[retrieved 2 July 2011]</ref>\n\n===change the eye level===\n\n:A pitcher \"changes the eye level\" of a hitter by thowing pitches at different heights in the strike zone. This is intended to keep the hitter off-balance or uncomfortable. \"Changing the eye-level of a hitter is important because as you advance, it'll become more difficult for you to get a hitter to move his feet in the batters box \u2013 even by pitching inside \u2013 so the next option is to move the hitter's eyes.\"<ref>\"How pitchers can make hitters make adjustments\", [https://archive.is/20120914094210/http://www.stevenellis.com/steven_ellis_the_complete/2006/09/how_pitchers_ca.html StevenEllis.com] [retrieved 2 July 2011]</ref>\n\n===changeup===\n{{Main article|changeup}}\n\n:A changeup or '''a change''' is a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitch|pitch]] meant to look like a [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fastball|fastball]] - but with less velocity - short for '''change of pace'''. A variety of this pitch is the '''circle change''', where a circle is formed using the thumb and index finger on the last third of a ball. This causes the ball to break inside and down to right-handed batter from a right-handed pitcher, frequently resulting in ground balls. Also, a '''straight change''' - made famous by [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] - can be utilized. The grip requires all fingers to be used in holding the ball, resulting in more friction, thus slowing the ball down tremendously.\n\n===charge===\n\n:*When an infielder runs towards a ground ball rather than wait for it to come to him.\n:*Runs are said to be \"charged\" to the pitcher who initially allowed the scoring runner to get on base.\n\n===charging the mound===\n{{Main article|Charging the mound}}\n\n:[[Charging the mound]] refers to a batter assaulting the pitcher after being [[Glossary of baseball (H)#hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] or in some cases after narrowly avoiding being hit. The first incident of a professional charging the mound has not been identified but the practice certainly dates back to the game's early days. Charging the mound is often the precipitating cause of a [[bench-clearing brawl]] and will most likely result in the batter's [[ejection (sports)|ejection]].\n\n===chase===\n\n:*To chase (or chase after) is to [[Glossary of baseball (S)#swing|swing]] at a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitch|pitch]] well outside of the [[Glossary of baseball (S)#strike zone|strike zone]].\n:*A pitcher who is removed from the game by the manager because he gave up too many runs is said to have been \"chased from the game\" or \"chased from the mound\" by the opposing batters. \"[[Andy Pettitte|Pettitte]] was chased from the game in the seventh inning following an RBI single by [[Willy Taveras]] and a two-RBI triple by [[Kazuo Matsui]].\"<ref>Ryan Thorburg, \"Rockies Play Hardball vs. Yanks\", [http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/jun/21/rockies-play-hardball-vs-yanks/ DailyCamera.com, June 21, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721172924/http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/jun/21/rockies-play-hardball-vs-yanks/ |date=July 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n:*A player or coach who is [[Glossary of baseball (E)#ejected|ejected]] from the game by an umpire can be said to be chased. \"[[Billy Martin|Martin]] was tossed by umpire [[Lee Weyer]] in the fourth game of the [[1976 World Series|1976 Series]], seven years after [[Earl Weaver|Weaver]] was chased by [[Shag Crawford]] in the fourth game in 1969.\"<ref>George Voss, \"Umpire Confrontations\", [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_1_61/ai_80599486/pg_5 Baseball Digest, January 2002.]</ref>\n\n===chatter===\n\n:To verbally challenge or taunt to distract the opposing batter. Fans and players alike participate in chatter. \"Heybattabattabatta\" is an example of common baseball chatter.\n\n===Chavez Ravine===\n\n:Nickname for [[Dodger Stadium]]. The ballpark was built in the late 1950s in a former residential neighborhood named Chavez Ravine.\n\n===cheap run===\n\n:A run that comes about from luck or with little effort by the offensive team.

If he fails to stop it in time, the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] will call a strike because he swung at the pitch. Often the umpire's view of the swing is obstructed. If the umpire calls the pitch a ball, a defensive player such as the catcher or pitcher can ask the home plate umpire to ask another umpire whether the batter swung at the pitch. In such a case, the home plate umpire always accepts the judgment of the other umpire. \"Basically, the [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] tied the [[Boston Red Sox|Sox]] in knots the entire game \u2014 or else they wouldn't have had as many checked swings as they did. Or as many strikes that they tried to sell to the umpires as balls.\"<ref>Tom Gage, \"Tigers' arms stymie Red Sox in series opener\", Detroit News, [http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20131012/SPORTS0104/310120065/Tigers-arms-stymie-Red-Sox-series-opener?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|FRONTPAGE October 13, 2013].</ref>\n\n===cheddar===\n\n:See [[Glossary of baseball (C)#cheese|cheese]].\n\n===cheese===\n\n:A [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fastball|fastball]], particularly one that is difficult to hit. A fastball high in the strike zone is also called [[Glossary of baseball (H)#high cheese|high cheese]], and one low in the zone can be called cheese at the knees. 'Easy Cheese' refers to the seemingly effortless motion of a pitcher as he throws a fastball at very high velocity.\n\n===chin music===\n\n:A [[Glossary of baseball (H)#high and tight|high and tight]], [[Glossary of baseball (U)#up and in|up and in]] [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitch|pitch]] meant to knock a batter back from [[Glossary of baseball (H)#home plate|home plate]] to avoid being hit on the chin. Also known as a ''[[Glossary of baseball (B)#brushback|brush-back]]'' or ''[[Glossary of baseball (P)#purpose pitch|purpose pitch]]''.\n\n===Chinese home run===\n{{main article|Chinese home run}}\n\n:*An older term for a home run, often a high fly ball, that barely clears the fence at that part of the outfield closest to the plate. It was frequently used in reference to such hits at the [[Polo Grounds]], former home of the [[New York Giants (MLB)|New York Giants]], which had notoriously short foul lines. Its use has declined since that stadium was demolished, and even further as it has been perceived as ethnically offensive.<ref name=\"Dickson Chinese home run definition\">{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary|date=2011|publisher=[[W.W.

This usage appears to be restricted to [[sandlot ball]] games in [[New England]], where it may have evolved from a supposed \"Chaney's home run\", a backward foul by a player of that name who eventually won a game for the hitting team when the ball, the last one available, could not be found. The umpire then ruled that the other team failed to provide an adequate number of balls and had thus forfeited the game.<ref name=\"Dickson Chinese home run definition\" />\n\n===chinker===\n\n:A [[Glossary of baseball (B)#blooper|blooper]]; a [[Glossary of baseball (D)#dying quail|dying quail]]; a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bleeder|bleeder]].\n\n===chopper===\n\n:A chopper refers to a batted ball that immediately strikes the hardened area of dirt directly in front of home plate, causing it to bounce high into the infield. Batters who are fast runners can convert such choppers into base hits. Also a batted ball that bounces several times before either being fielded by an infielder or reaching the outfield. Former Braves broadcaster Skip Caray often whimsically called bouncers to third base when Atlanta was on defense as \"a chopper to Chipper\" in reference to long-time Braves third baseman [[Chipper Jones]].\n\n===choke up===\n\n:A [[Glossary of baseball (B)#batter|batter]] \"chokes up\" by sliding his hands up from the knob end of the [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bat|bat]] to give him more control over his bat. It reduces the power and increases the control. Prior to driving in the Series-winning hit with a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#blooper|bloop single]] in the [[2001 World Series]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] choked up on the bat. Thus he came through, and did not \"[[choke (sports)|choke]]\" in the clutch.\n\n===chuck===\n\n:Throw. A pitcher is sometimes referred to as a chucker or someone who can really chuck the ball. In San Francisco, sometimes the fans are referred to as '''battery chuckers''', referring to several incidents where many fans threw batteries onto the field. These incidents date back at least to the early aughts in San Francisco, although there was at least one earlier incident involving Phillies fans.<ref>https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2011/3/11/2044411/jd-drew-phillies-fans-batteries</ref>\n\n===circle===\n\n:The ''on-deck circle'', officially known as the [[Glossary of baseball (N)#next batter's box|next batter's box]].\n\n===circus catch===\n\n:An outstanding catch, usually when a fielder has to leave his feet or go through contortions to make, resembling a circus acrobat in the process.\n\n===clean hit===\n\n:When a batter hits a ball through the infield without its being touched by a fielder, he may be said to have a \"clean hit\". Similarly, if a batter hits a ball over an outfielder's head, he may have a \"clean hit\". \"[[Tris Speaker|Tris]] truly loved to hit and would always get a thrill when getting a 'clean' hit that travelled over an outfielder's head.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadball.com/speaker.htm |title=The domain name deadball.com is for sale |publisher=Deadball.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\n===clean inning===\n\n:When a team pitches and plays defense without mental or physical errors or allowing the other team to score runs or advance runners easily. \"I want to see clean innings\", [[Cecil Cooper|Cooper]] said. \"This is a time when we should be seeing them{{snd}}crisp, clean innings. Yet we're hitting guys [who] are trying to bunt, walking guys on four pitches{{nbsp}}... This is not young kids doing this stuff. This is ridiculous. I don't care who it is.

Alternatively, they might specialize in a pitch that is difficult to hit, such as the [[Split-finger fastball|splitter]] or the [[Cutter (baseball)|cut fastball]].\n\n===close the book===\n:One can \"close the book\" on a pitcher who has been replaced when his statistics for the game become final. If a [[Glossary of baseball (R)#relief pitcher|relief pitcher]] enters the game with one or more [[Inherited runners|inherited runners]], and those runners eventually score, they still affect the statistics of the pitcher who allowed them on base (e.g., [[Glossary of baseball (E)#Earned run average|earned run average]]). Once all runners charged to a particular pitcher score or get put out, or the third out is made in the inning, then his statistics can no longer change (except his status as [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitcher of record|pitcher of record]]) and his \"book\" is \"closed\".\n\n===clothesline===\n\n:See \"[[Glossary of baseball (T)#throw a clothesline|throw a clothesline]]\".\n\n===clubhouse===\n\n:A team's [[Changing room|locker room]], which may also include eating, entertainment, and workout facilities, especially at the highest professional level.

May refer to such a situation (being '''in the clutch''') or to a player (a good [[clutch hitter]], or one who \"can hit in the clutch\"); or to specific [[Glossary of baseball (H)#hit|hits]] (\"that was a clutch hit\"). Most baseball [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fan|fans]] believe that clutch hitting exists, but there is significant disagreement among [[Glossary of baseball (S)#stathead|statheads]] whether clutch hitting is a specific skill or instead just something good hitters in general do. An old synonym for clutch is '''pinch''', as in [[Christy Mathewson]]'s book, ''Pitching in a Pinch''.\n\n===cock-shot===\n:A belt-high, very hittable fastball, usually down the middle of the plate.

Thus, he's usually able to make contact with the ball and [[Glossary of baseball (I)#In play|put it in play]]. This doesn't mean he's necessarily a pitty-patty [[Glossary of baseball (S)#slap hitter|slap hitter]]. He may hit for power, but typically with more doubles/triples instead of home runs.

In such a case, the runner is told to \"run on contact\". This play would typically occur when the game is close or the bases are loaded. More generally, \"Baserunners 'run on contact' when there are two outs, since there is nothing to lose if the ball is caught or the batter is thrown out.\"<ref>James Click, \"What if Ricky Henderson Had Pete Incaviglia's Legs\", in [[Jonah Keri]], Ed., ''Baseball Between the Numbers'' (New York: Basic Books, 2006), p. 117.</ref>\n\n===control artist===\n{{Main article|Control pitcher}}\n\n:A pitcher who gives up very few bases on balls or has excellent [[Command (baseball)|command]] of his pitches.

Usually announced as a pair of numbers, for instance \"3\u20130\" (pronounced \"three and oh\"), with the first number being the number of balls and the second being the number of strikes. A 3\u20132 count&nbsp;\u2013 one with the maximum number of balls and strikes in a given at bat&nbsp;\u2013 is referred to as a '''full count'''. A count of 1\u20131 or 2\u20132 is called '''even''', although the pitcher is considered to have the advantage on a 2\u20132 pitch because he can still throw another ball without consequence, whereas another strike means the batter is out. A batter is said to be '''ahead in the count''' (and a pitcher behind in the count) if the count is 1\u20130, 2\u20130, 2\u20131, 3\u20130, or 3\u20131. A batter is said to be '''behind in the count''' (and a pitcher ahead in the count) if the count is 0\u20131, 0\u20132, or 1\u20132.\n\n===cousin===\n\n:A pitcher who is easy for a particular batter to hit.\n\n===covering a base===\n{{Main article|Covering a base}}\n\n:*Part of the infielders' job is to cover bases. That is, stand next to a base in anticipation of receiving the ball from another fielder, then make a play on a baserunner who is approaching that base. On a [[force play]] or an [[appeal play]], the fielder covering a base stands with one foot on that base when he catches the ball.\n:*When a [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fielder|fielder]] goes to make a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#play|play]] at a [[Baseball field#Specifications|base]] that is not his [[Glossary of baseball (P)#position|position]] (usually because the fielder for that base is unavailable to [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] the ball at that base because he is busy [[Glossary of baseball (F)#field|fielding]] the [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bat|batted ball]]). A common example is when the [[first baseman]] [[Glossary of baseball (F)#field|fields]] a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bat|batted]] [[Glossary of baseball (G)#ground ball|ground ball]], but is too far from the base to [[putout|put the runner out]]. The [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitcher|pitcher]] runs over to \"cover\" [[Baseball field#First base|first base]] to take the throw from the first baseman (play would be scored as \"3-1\", meaning first baseman to pitcher).\n\n===crack of the bat===\n\n:*The sound of the bat hitting the ball. The term is used in baseball to mean \"immediately, without hesitation\". For example, a baserunner may start running \"on the crack of the bat\", as opposed to waiting to see where the ball goes.\n:*Outfielders often use the sound of bat-meeting-ball as a clue to how far a ball has been hit. As physicist [[Robert Adair (physicist)|Robert Adair]] has written, \"When a baseball is hit straight at an outfielder he cannot quickly judge the angle of ascent and the distance the ball will travel. If he waits until the trajectory is well defined, he has waited too long and will not be able to reach otherwise catchable balls. If he starts quickly, but misjudges the ball such that his first step is wrong (in for a long fly or back for a short fly), the turn-around time sharply reduces his range and he will again miss catchable balls. To help his judgment, the experienced outfielder listens to the sound of the wooden bat hitting the ball. If he hears a 'crack' he runs out, if he hears a 'clunk' he runs in.\"<ref>Robert K.

This fielder is said to \"cut off\" the throw or to be the \"[[Cut-off man|cut-off man]]\". This tactic increases accuracy over long distances and shortens the time required to get a ball to a specific place. It also gives the cut-off man the choice of putting out a trailing runner trying to advance [[On the throw|on the throw]] if he thinks it impossible to make the play at home.

The phrase is said to have originated in the nineteenth-century and relates to an old-time grocer's method of getting canned goods down from a high shelf. Using a stick with a hook on the end, a grocer could tip a can so it would fall for an easy catch into his apron. One theory for use of corn as the canned good in the phrase is that a can of corn was considered the easiest \"catch\" as corn was the best selling vegetable in the store and so was heavily stocked on the lowest shelves. Another theory is that the corn refers to the practice in the very early days of baseball of calling the outfield the \"corn field\", especially in early amateur baseball where the outfield may have been a farm field. Frequently used by [[Red Barber]], a variation, 'A #8 CAN OF GOLDEN BANTAM' was favored by [[Bob Prince]], Pittsburgh Pirates' announcer. The phrase was also used by Yankee announcer [[Phil Rizzuto]] and Red Sox and then White Sox broadcaster [[Ken Harrelson|Ken \"The Hawk\" Harrelson]]. Also, a phrase used to refer to something that is not challenging. Informally, can of corn may be used as a phrase to describe mild excitement, personal acknowledgement or recognition of significance.\n\n===Captain Hook===\n\n:A manager who often takes a pitcher out of the game at the first sign of trouble.

In professional baseball, play continues and after continuous playing action ceases, the umpire calls time. The penalty is that the batter is awarded first base; any runner attempting to steal is awarded that base and all other runners advance only if forced. The manager of the offensive team has the option of keeping the result of the play. He will not be given the option by the umpires and must explicitly declare it before the play continues after awarding bases. The catcher is charged with an error.

This causes the ball to break inside and down to right-handed batter from a right-handed pitcher, frequently resulting in ground balls. Also, a '''straight change''' - made famous by [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] - can be utilized.

Batters who are fast runners can convert such choppers into base hits. Also a batted ball that bounces several times before either being fielded by an infielder or reaching the outfield. Former Braves broadcaster Skip Caray often whimsically called bouncers to third base when Atlanta was on defense as \"a chopper to Chipper\" in reference to long-time Braves third baseman [[Chipper Jones]].\n\n===choke up===\n\n:A [[Glossary of baseball (B)#batter|batter]] \"chokes up\" by sliding his hands up from the knob end of the [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bat|bat]] to give him more control over his bat. It reduces the power and increases the control. Prior to driving in the Series-winning hit with a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#blooper|bloop single]] in the [[2001 World Series]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] choked up on the bat. Thus he came through, and did not \"[[choke (sports)|choke]]\" in the clutch.\n\n===chuck===\n\n:Throw. A pitcher is sometimes referred to as a chucker or someone who can really chuck the ball.

Usually announced as a pair of numbers, for instance \"3\u20130\" (pronounced \"three and oh\"), with the first number being the number of balls and the second being the number of strikes. A 3\u20132 count&nbsp;\u2013 one with the maximum number of balls and strikes in a given at bat&nbsp;\u2013 is referred to as a '''full count'''. A count of 1\u20131 or 2\u20132 is called '''even''', although the pitcher is considered to have the advantage on a 2\u20132 pitch because he can still throw another ball without consequence, whereas another strike means the batter is out. A batter is said to be '''ahead in the count''' (and a pitcher behind in the count) if the count is 1\u20130, 2\u20130, 2\u20131, 3\u20130, or 3\u20131. A batter is said to be '''behind in the count''' (and a pitcher ahead in the count) if the count is 0\u20131, 0\u20132, or 1\u20132.\n\n===cousin===\n\n:A pitcher who is easy for a particular batter to hit.\n\n===covering a base===\n{{Main article|Covering a base}}\n\n:*Part of the infielders' job is to cover bases. That is, stand next to a base in anticipation of receiving the ball from another fielder, then make a play on a baserunner who is approaching that base. On a [[force play]] or an [[appeal play]], the fielder covering a base stands with one foot on that base when he catches the ball.\n:*When a [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fielder|fielder]] goes to make a [[Glossary of baseball (P)#play|play]] at a [[Baseball field#Specifications|base]] that is not his [[Glossary of baseball (P)#position|position]] (usually because the fielder for that base is unavailable to [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] the ball at that base because he is busy [[Glossary of baseball (F)#field|fielding]] the [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bat|batted ball]]). A common example is when the [[first baseman]] [[Glossary of baseball (F)#field|fields]] a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bat|batted]] [[Glossary of baseball (G)#ground ball|ground ball]], but is too far from the base to [[putout|put the runner out]]. The [[Glossary of baseball (P)#pitcher|pitcher]] runs over to \"cover\" [[Baseball field#First base|first base]] to take the throw from the first baseman (play would be scored as \"3-1\", meaning first baseman to pitcher).\n\n===crack of the bat===\n\n:*The sound of the bat hitting the ball. The term is used in baseball to mean \"immediately, without hesitation\". For example, a baserunner may start running \"on the crack of the bat\", as opposed to waiting to see where the ball goes.\n:*Outfielders often use the sound of bat-meeting-ball as a clue to how far a ball has been hit. As physicist [[Robert Adair (physicist)|Robert Adair]] has written, \"When a baseball is hit straight at an outfielder he cannot quickly judge the angle of ascent and the distance the ball will travel. If he waits until the trajectory is well defined, he has waited too long and will not be able to reach otherwise catchable balls. If he starts quickly, but misjudges the ball such that his first step is wrong (in for a long fly or back for a short fly), the turn-around time sharply reduces his range and he will again miss catchable balls. To help his judgment, the experienced outfielder listens to the sound of the wooden bat hitting the ball. If he hears a 'crack' he runs out, if he hears a 'clunk' he runs in.\"<ref>Robert K.

In the latter case, he's said to '''\"cut the ball off\"''' because he's trying to shorten the path of the ball. \"When [[Curtis Granderson|Granderson]] drifted towards left-center field on [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]]'s fifth-inning line drive, he wasn't heading that direction to make a catch. He was preparing to field it on the bounce.

This fielder is said to \"cut off\" the throw or to be the \"[[Cut-off man|cut-off man]]\". This tactic increases accuracy over long distances and shortens the time required to get a ball to a specific place. It also gives the cut-off man the choice of putting out a trailing runner trying to advance [[On the throw|on the throw]] if he thinks it impossible to make the play at home. '''Missing the cut-off''' (man) is considered a [[Glossary of baseball (M)#mistake|mistake]] by an outfielder (though not scored as an error) because it may allow a runner to advance or to score.\n\n===cut-off man===\n\n:A [[Glossary of baseball (F)#fielder|fielder]] who \"[[Glossary of baseball (C)#cut-off|cuts off]]\" a long throw to an important target.
