{"title_page": "List of United States light rail systems by ridership", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{See also|List of North American light rail systems by ridership|List of United States rapid transit systems by ridership}}\n{{Use mdy dates|cs1-dates=ly|date=April 2020}}\nThe following is a '''list of all [[light rail]] systems in the United States, ranked by ridership.'''  Also included are those urban [[tram|streetcar/trolley]] systems that are providing regular public transit service (i.e. operating year-round and at least five days/week). This list does ''not'' include statistics for [[Rapid transit|metro/rapid transit]] systems (see: the [[List of United States rapid transit systems by ridership]] for those). Daily and annual ridership figures are based on \"average weekday ''unlinked'' passenger trips\" (where transfers between lines are counted as two separate passenger \"boardings\" or \"trips\"). The annual ridership figures for 2019 and average weekday ridership figures for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2019 come from the [[American Public Transportation Association]]'s (APTA) Ridership Reports statistics for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2019,<ref name=\"APTA-2019-Q4\" /> unless otherwise noted (e.g. [[NJ Transit]] systems).  References with supplementary (i.e. non-APTA) ridership figures are included in the ''System'' column.\n\n== List ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!\n! style=\"width:250px;\"| System\n!

One of the film series' main characters, Fiona is introduced as a beautiful princess placed under a curse that transforms her into an ogre at night. She is initially determined to break the enchantment by kissing a prince, only to meet and fall in love with [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], an ogre, instead. The character's origins and relationships with other characters are further explored in subsequent films; she introduces her new husband Shrek to her parents in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), becomes a mother by ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), and is an empowered warrior in ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010), much of which takes place in an [[Multiverse|alternate reality]] in which Fiona and Shrek never meet.\n\nCreated by screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], Fiona is loosely based on the unsightly princess in [[William Steig]]'s children's book ''[[Shrek!]]'' (1990), from which her role and appearance were significantly modified. The screenwriters adapted the character into a princess under a [[shapeshifting]] enchantment, an idea that was initially greatly contested by other filmmakers. Fiona is voiced by actress [[Cameron Diaz]]. Comedian and actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] was originally cast as the character until she was fired from the first film with little explanation. Fiona was one of the first human characters to have a lead role in a [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] film, thus the animators aspired to make her both beautiful and realistic in appearance. However, an early [[test screening]] resulted in children reacting negatively towards the character's [[Uncanny valley|uncanny realism]], prompting the animators to re-design Fiona into a more stylized, cartoonish heroine. Several revolutionary achievements in computer animation were applied to the character to render convincing skin, hair, clothing and lighting.\n\nThe character is considered a [[parody]] of traditional princesses in both fairy tales and [[Disney Princess|animated Disney films]]. Reception towards Fiona has been mostly positive, with critics commending her characterization, [[martial arts]] prowess and Diaz's performance. However, reviewers were divided over the character's human design, some of whom were impressed by her technological innovations, while others found her realism unsettling and too similar to Diaz. Several media publications consider Fiona a feminist icon, crediting her with subverting princess and gender stereotypes by embracing her flaws. Diaz also became one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses due to her role in the ''Shrek'' franchise, earning $3 million for her performance in the first film and upwards of $10 million for each sequel.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Creation and writing ===\n\n''Shrek'' is loosely based on [[William Steig]]'s [[Children\u2019s book|children's book]] ''[[Shrek!]]'' (1990),<ref>{{cite

decided to adapt ''Shrek!''<nowiki/>'s princess into a beautiful maiden who has been cursed to become ugly only during evenings, which she is forced to conceal from the film's other characters, thus providing \"narrative motivation for not showing her ogre manifestation.\"<ref name=\":17\" /> Furthermore, Furniss observed that [[Lord Farquaad]]'s romantic interest in Fiona is more practical since he is vain and only attracted to her beauty, while his main motivation remains to marry a princess so that he can rule Duloc.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nFeeling that her curse remaining undiscovered until the end was unsuitable for a feature-length film, screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] introduced the concept of a [[shapeshifting]] princess, which was rejected by the other filmmakers for six months because they found it \"too complex\" for a fairy tale.<ref name=\":60\">{{cite web|url=https://creativescreenwriting.com/shrek/|title=Ted Elliott and

Elliot and Rossio contested that similar ideas had been used successfully in Disney's ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ultimately convincing the studio by referring to Fiona as an enchanted princess instead.<ref name=\":60\" /> Some writers expressed concerns over whether turning Fiona into an ogre full-time once she professes her love for Shrek suggested \"that ugly people belong with ugly people.\"<ref name=\":60\" /> Rossio explained that since Fiona shape-shifts, the best moral is \"'Even princesses who change their shapes can find love too.' And Shrek would love her in all of her varied forms.\"<ref name=\":60\" /> Elliot elaborated that this prompts audiences to debate if Fiona's \"true form\" is beautiful or unattractive: \"Her true form is beautiful by day, ugly by night.' ... and she was trying to rid herself of part of who she truly was, because society maintained that was wrong.\"<ref name=\":60\" /> The studio ultimately conceded that Fiona remain an ogre, which Elliot considers to be \"a more conventional idea\".<ref name=\":60\" /> \n\nIn early drafts of the script, Fiona is born an ogre to human parents, who lock

To determine the gown's volume, fullness and where certain areas would rest on the character's form, the costume designer worked with both a pattern maker and designer.<ref name=\":40\" /> The patterns and seams were labeled and forwarded to the animators, who would replicate the images on the computer.<ref name=\":40\" /> Mussenden decided to give Fiona's dresses tight sleeves as opposed to the long, flowing sleeves associated with traditional [[Medieval fashion|medieval clothing]] due to the difficulty the latter would have been for the animators.<ref name=\":41\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/05/18/clothes-make-the-ogre/a04bd3bd-2597-4e9d-9ee4-7a6c5c244319/|title=Clothes Make the Ogre|last=|first=|date=2004|website=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref> Unlike ''Shrek'', Fiona has several costume changes in ''Shrek 2''.

One of the film series' main characters, Fiona is introduced as a beautiful princess placed under a curse that transforms her into an ogre at night. She is initially determined to break the enchantment by kissing a prince, only to meet and fall in love with [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], an ogre, instead. The character's origins and relationships with other characters are further explored in subsequent films; she introduces her new husband Shrek to her parents in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), becomes a mother by ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), and is an empowered warrior in ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010), much of which takes place in an [[Multiverse|alternate reality]] in which Fiona and Shrek never meet.\n\nCreated by screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], Fiona is loosely based on the unsightly princess in [[William Steig]]'s children's book ''[[Shrek!]]'' (1990), from which her role and appearance were significantly modified. The screenwriters adapted the character into a princess under a [[shapeshifting]] enchantment, an idea that was initially greatly contested by other filmmakers. Fiona is voiced by actress [[Cameron Diaz]]. Comedian and actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] was originally cast as the character until she was fired from the first film with little explanation. Fiona was one of the first human characters to have a lead role in a [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] film, thus the animators aspired to make her both beautiful and realistic in appearance. However, an early [[test screening]] resulted in children reacting negatively towards the character's [[Uncanny valley|uncanny realism]], prompting the animators to re-design Fiona into a more stylized, cartoonish heroine. Several revolutionary achievements in computer animation were applied to the character to render convincing skin, hair, clothing and lighting.\n\nThe character is considered a [[parody]] of traditional princesses in both fairy tales and [[Disney Princess|animated Disney films]]. Reception towards Fiona has been mostly positive, with critics commending her characterization, [[martial arts]] prowess and Diaz's performance. However, reviewers were divided over the character's human design, some of whom were impressed by her technological innovations, while others found her realism unsettling and too similar to Diaz. Several media publications consider Fiona a feminist icon, crediting her with subverting princess and gender stereotypes by embracing her flaws. Diaz also became one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses due to her role in the ''Shrek'' franchise, earning $3 million for her performance in the first film and upwards of $10 million for each sequel.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Creation and writing ===\n\n''Shrek'' is loosely based on [[William Steig]]'s [[Children\u2019s book|children's book]] ''[[Shrek!]]'' (1990),<ref>{{cite

providing \"narrative motivation for not showing her ogre manifestation.\"<ref name=\":17\" /> Furthermore, Furniss observed that [[Lord Farquaad]]'s romantic interest in Fiona is more practical since he is vain and only attracted to her beauty, while his main motivation remains to marry a princess so that he can rule Duloc.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nFeeling that her curse remaining undiscovered until

an ogre full-time once she professes her love for Shrek suggested \"that ugly people belong with ugly people.\"<ref name=\":60\" /> Rossio explained that since Fiona shape-shifts, the best moral is \"'Even princesses who change their shapes can find love too.'

character resemble Diaz too closely, elements of the actress's movements and mannerisms, which were videotaped during recording sessions,<ref name=\":71\" /> were incorporated into Fiona nonetheless, which they drew onto a different face to create a unique new character.<ref name=\":7\" /> Studying Diaz's mannerisms inspired the animators to exaggerate Fiona's expressions and reactions, instead of

previous computer animated films, in which clothing was typically depicted as a tight layer over the figure, adorned with a few wrinkles.<ref name=\":40\" /> The filmmakers had envisioned Fiona's velvet gown as one that moves independently from her body, therefore one of the film's producers recruited Mussenden, with whom they had worked prior, to assist them with the process.<ref name=\":40\"

To determine the gown's volume, fullness and where certain areas would rest on the character's form, the costume designer worked with both a pattern maker and designer.<ref name=\":40\" /> The patterns and seams were labeled and forwarded to the animators, who would replicate the images on the computer.<ref name=\":40\" /> Mussenden decided to give Fiona's dresses tight sleeves as opposed to the long, flowing sleeves associated with traditional [[Medieval fashion|medieval clothing]] due to the difficulty the latter would have been for the animators.<ref name=\":41\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/05/18/clothes-make-the-ogre/a04bd3bd-2597-4e9d-9ee4-7a6c5c244319/|title=Clothes Make the Ogre|last=|first=|date=2004|website=[[The Washington Post]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 21, 2018}}</ref> Unlike ''Shrek'', Fiona has several costume changes in ''Shrek 2''.

To ensure that both forms looked equally flattering in the same outfit, Mussenden lowered the dress' waistline to make it more medieval in appearance than the costume she wears in the first film.<ref name=\":41\" /> Fiona's first costume is a lilac dress, which Mussenden designed to appear \"organic and textured, because she's been living in the swamp\".

Franco was a scholar and agent for Immanuel Perada, a Dutch merchant. He delivered supplies to Edward Gibbons, a [[major general]] in the Massachusetts militia. After a dispute over who should pay Franco (Gibbons or Perada) the [[Massachusetts General Court]] ruled on May 6, 1649, that Franco was to be expelled from the colony, and granted him \"six shillings per week out of the Treasury for ten weeks, for sustenance, till he can get his passage to Holland.\"{{ref|Franco}}{{ref|Franco2}}\n\n===Solomon Pietersen===\nSolomon Pietersen was a merchant from Amsterdam who came to town in 1654. In 1656, Pietersen became the first known American Jew to [[interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarry]] with a [[Christianity|Christian]]; though there are no records showing Pietersen formally converted, his daughter Anna was [[Baptism|baptized]] in childhood.{{ref|Pietersen}}{{ref|Pietersen2}}{{ref|Pietersen3}}\n\n===Jacob Barsimson===\nOn July 8, 1654, [[Jacob Barsimson]] left Holland and arrived aboard ''Peartree'' on August 22 in the port of [[New Amsterdam]] (in [[Lower Manhattan]], where [[Wall Street]] is today). Barsimson was employed by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and had fled the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese settlements in the New World]], who had captured a formerly Dutch settlement and established the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] there.\n\n===Asser Levy===\n[[Asher Levy|Asser Levy (Van Swellem)]] is first mentioned in public records in [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654 in connection with the group of 23 Jews who arrived as refugees from [[Brazil]]. It is likely he preceded their arrival.  Levy was the (kosher) butcher for the small [[Congregation Shearith Israel|Jewish community]].  He fought for Jewish rights in the Dutch colony and is famous for having secured the right of Jews to be admitted as Burghers and to serve guard duty for the colony.\n\n==Dutch Brazilian Sephardi group==\n{{further|History of Pernambuco#Jews in Pernambuco|Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands}}\n\nThe [[Jewish arrival in New Amsterdam|first ''group'' of Jews in the northern colonies]] disembarked in early September 1654, shortly after Barsimson. Barsimson is said to have met them at [[Battery Park|The Battery]] upon their arrival. This group was made up of twenty-three [[Portuguese Jews]] from the Netherlands (four couples, two widows, and thirteen children). Like Barsimson, they had fled from a former Dutch settlement; the group had emigrated from [[Dutch Brazil]] after the settlement was conquered by the Portuguese. Fearing the Inquisition, the Jews left Recife. They originally docked in [[Spanish Jamaica]] and [[Spanish Cuba]], but the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] did not allow them to remain there. Their ship, ''Ste. Catherine'', went to New Amsterdam instead, settling against the wishes of local merchants and the local [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. Colonial governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]], upon complaint from these groups, attempted to have the Jews expelled. He wrote a letter to the directors of the [[Dutch West India Company]] dated September 22, 1654:\n\n<blockquote>The Jews who have arrived would nearly all like to remain here, but learning that they (with their customary [[usury]] and deceitful trading with the Christians) were very repugnant to the inferior magistrates, as also to the people having the most affection for you; the Deaconry also fearing that owing to their present indigence they might become a charge in the coming winter, we have, for the benefit of this weak and newly developing place and the land in general, deemed it useful to require them in a friendly way to depart, praying also most seriously in this connection, for ourselves as also for the general community of your worships, that the deceitful race&mdash;such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of [[Christ]]&mdash;be not allowed to further infect and trouble this new colony to the detraction of your worships and the dissatisfaction of your worships' most affectionate subjects.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, among the directors of the Dutch West India Company included several influential Jews, who interceded on the refugees' behalf. Company officials rebuffed Stuyvesant and ordered him in a letter dated April 26, 1655, to let the Jews remain in New Amsterdam, \"provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation\":\n\n<blockquote>We would have liked to effectuate and fulfill your wishes and request that the new territories should no more be allowed to be infected by people of the Jewish nation, for we foresee therefrom the same difficulties which you fear, but after having further weighed and considered the matter, we observe that this would be somewhat unreasonable and unfair, especially because of the considerable loss sustained by this nation, with others, in the taking of Brazil, as also because of the large amount of capital which they still have invested in the shares of this company. Therefore after many deliberations we have finally decided and resolved to apostille [annotate] upon a certain petition presented by said Portuguese Jews that these people may travel and trade to and in [[New Netherland]] and live and remain there, provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation. You will now govern yourself accordingly.</blockquote>\n\nUpon the capture of the colony by the English in 1664, the rights enjoyed by the Jews were not interfered with, and for twenty years they appear to have lived much as before the British occupation, though with slight increase in their numbers. Jews had previously been barred from settling in English colonies, as they had been banned from all English lands for 400 years. [[Oliver Cromwell]] (British Protector from 1649 through 1660, through his son Richard) lifted this prohibition, and founding of the first major Jewish settlement soon followed in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. In 1672, Rabba Couty attained prominence by his appeal to the [[King's Council]] in England from a decree passed against him by the courts of Jamaica, as a result of which one of his ships had been seized and declared forfeited. His appeal was successful and established the rights of Jews as British subjects. This appears to be the first case in which a colonial grant of [[naturalization]] was recognized as valid.\n\n==New York==\n{{further|History of the Jews in New York|Jews in New York City}}\n\nIn 1685, the application of Saul Brown (originally Saul Pardo) to trade at retail was denied, as was also that of the Jews for liberty to exercise their religion publicly. That they did so privately in some definite place of worship would appear from the fact that a map of New York, dated 1695, shows the location of a Jewish synagogue on [[Beaver Street (Manhattan)|Beaver Street]], also that Saul Brown was the minister, and that the congregation comprised twenty families. Five years later the site of the synagogue was so well known that in a conveyance of property the premises were referred to as a landmark. In 1710, the minister of the congregation, Abraham de Lucena, was granted exemption from civil and military service by reason of his ministerial functions, and reference is made to the enjoyment of the same privileges by his predecessors. The minutes of the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]] of New York begin in 1729, when it was located in Mill Street, and refer to records dating back as far as 1706. This congregation established on Mill Street, in 1730, on a lot purchased two years before, the first synagogue in the future [[United States]].\n\nIt would thus appear that the religious rights of these early Jewish settlers had been secured in the beginning of the 18th century, and that they enjoyed also many political rights. An act passed by the [[General Assembly of New York]] on November 15, 1727, provided that when the oath of abjuration was to be taken by any British subject professing the Jewish religion, the words \"upon the true faith of a Christian\" might be omitted. Three days later an act was passed naturalizing one Daniel Nunes da Costa. A bitter political controversy of 1737 resulted in the decision by the General Assembly that Jews should not be allowed to vote for members of that body.\n\nIn 1740, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Plantation Act 1740|Plantation Act]] specifically permitting Jews to be naturalized in [[British America|the colonies]]. Previous to this date, however, the New York Colonial Assembly had passed numerous special acts of naturalization, some of which were applicable to individuals only; others, more general in character, under which Jews could be naturalized without taking oath \"upon the true faith of a Christian,\" were also put upon the statute-book. Between this time and the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the Jewish community in this colony increased by slow stages, the principal immigrants coming from [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and the [[West Indies]].\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], Jacob Franks was the royal agent, in association with a British syndicate, for provisioning the British forces in America; his dealings with the crown during this period exceeded \u00a3750,000 in value.\n\n==Upstate New York settlement==\n{{main|History of the Jews in New York}}\n\nAlthough most of the earlier immigrants settled in New York City, a few settled beyond its limits, some even as far as the confines of what now constitutes the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1661, when [[Albany, New York|Albany]] was but a trading-post, Asser Levy owned real estate there, but between that date and the early years of the nineteenth century there are no records of any settlers in that town. They were not there in sufficient numbers to form a congregation until 1838, and they had no rabbi until 1846.\n\n==In New England==\n\nA group of Jews settled in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in the late 1600s due to the official religious tolerance of the colony as established by [[Roger Williams]]. In other parts of [[New England]] there were probably occasional settlers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but the intolerance of the [[Puritans]] rendered impossible the establishment of any religious communities. According to several sources, [[Moses Simonson]], who settled in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] in 1621, may have had Dutch Jewish ancestry.<ref>Arthur Hertzberg, The Jews in America: Four Centuries of an Uneasy Encounter : a History (1997), pg. 22 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0231108419</ref><ref>American Jewish Historical Quarterly, Volume 1, pg 107\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=B6UyAQAAMAAJ (1893)</ref> An interesting personality is that of [[Judah Monis]], who became a convert to [[Christianity]] and filled the chair of Hebrew in [[Harvard College]] from 1722 until his death in 1764.\n\nMention is found of a Jew in [[Connecticut]] on November 9, 1659, and of another in 1670. The first Jewish family to settle in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] came in 1772, though a few individuals who had become converts to Christianity dwelt there a few years before. The first congregation was established about 1840, the congregants being members of about twenty [[Bavaria]]n families. From that date on the community increased by slow stages. There are Jewish settlements also in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Ansonia, Connecticut|Ansonia]], [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. The first congregation in Hartford was established in 1843. Since 1891, a number of Jewish farmers have been settled in various parts of the state.\n\nThe earliest mention of a Jew in [[Massachusetts]] bears the date May 3, 1649, and there are references to Jews among the inhabitants of [[Boston]] in 1695 and 1702; but they can be regarded only as stragglers, as no settlers made their homes in Massachusetts until the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] drove the Jews from [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]. In 1777, Aaron Lopez and Jacob Rivera, with fifty-nine others, went from Newport to [[Leicester, Massachusetts|Leicester]], and established themselves there; but this settlement did not survive the close of the war. A number of Jews, including the Hays family, settled at Boston before 1800. Of these [[Moses Michael Hays]] was the most important. In 1830, a number of [[Algerian Jews]] went to Boston, but they soon disappeared. The history of the present community begins with 1840, when the first congregation was established.\n\nThe Jewish immigrants to [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] have never been very numerous, though there are congregations in [[Burlington, Vermont]] and in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], and [[Dover, New Hampshire]]. Little of importance can be said about the communal life of the Jews in New England, and their numbers increased but slowly until after the beginning of the great Russian emigration in 1882, when the overflow from New York as well as the emigration through [[Canada]] commenced to stream into New England.\n\nThe opening up of the West and the resulting unprofitable nature of farming in New England drew away from this part of the United States many thrifty farmers, who abandoned their unfruitful fields for the more attractive opportunities in the western states. Of interest in connection with this shifting of the population is the fact that many of these abandoned farms, especially in Connecticut, have been taken up by [[Russian Jews]], who, principally as [[dairy farming|dairy farmers]], have added a new and useful element to the agricultural community.\n\n==Maryland==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Baltimore}}\n\nIt would seem that only a few Jews found their way to [[Maryland]] during the first half of the 17th century, and that the first settlers of this colony came as individuals, and not in considerable numbers at any time, as was the case in New York, Newport, [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. To judge by the names alone it would appear that a few Jews were resident in Maryland from the earliest days of the colony. The most prominent figure, who was unquestionably a Jew, was a Dr. [[Jacob Lumbrozo]], who had arrived January 24, 1656, and who, in 1658, was tried for blasphemy, but was released by reason of the general amnesty granted in honor of the accession of [[Richard Cromwell]] (March 3, 1658). Letters of denization were issued to Lumbrozo September 10, 1663. Besides practising medicine, he also owned a plantation, engaged in trade with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and had active intercourse with London merchants. He was one of the earliest medical practitioners in the colony, and his career casts much light upon the history and nature of religious tolerance in Maryland. By the strength of his personality he was able to disregard nearly all the laws which would have rendered his residence in the colony impossible, and he seems to have observed his faith even though this, under the laws, was forbidden. The unfavorable environment rendered the admittance of Jews to Maryland difficult, and until the [[Maryland Constitution of 1776|Constitution of 1776]] established the religious rights of all, few Jews settled in the colony.\n\n==Pennsylvania==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Pennsylvania}}\n{{main|History of the Jews in Philadelphia|History of the Jews in Pittsburgh}}\n\nIt is on record that Jews from New Amsterdam traded along the [[Delaware River]] as early as 1655. There were probably some settlers in the southeastern portion of the territory of which [[William Penn]] took possession in 1681. A very considerable number of the early Pennsylvania colonists were [[German Jews]]. The first Jewish resident of [[Philadelphia]] was Jonas Aaron, who was living there in 1703. Another early pioneer and one of considerable prominence was [[Isaac Miranda]]. He was the first to settle at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], at which place, as also at [[Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania|Shaefferstown]], there was an early Jewish immigration. Miranda became a convert to [[Christianity]] and held several state offices. A number of Jews settled in Philadelphia in the first half of the eighteenth century, and became prominent in the life of the city. Among these were [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], Joseph Marks, and Sampson Levy. The Non-Importation Resolutions of 1765 contained the signatures of eight Jews, an indication of the importance of the Jewish community at this time. As early as 1747 a number of persons held religious services in a small house in Sterling alley, and afterward in Cherry alley&mdash;between Third and Fourth streets. They were mostly German and [[Polish Jews]]; and their differences as to the liturgy to be followed prevented, at the time, the formation of any regular congregation. Attempts, indeed, were made in 1761 and 1773 to form one, but none was established until the influx of Jews from New York during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], with the arrival of [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]], gave the community sufficient strength to carry out this cherished object. A lot was purchased and a synagogue erected, the dedication occurring in September 1782. A number of Philadelphia Jews served in the army of the Revolution; and the inestimable services rendered by [[Haym Salomon]] to [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]] in the finances of the Revolution make his name stand out as the most prominent character in American Jewry.\n\nJews have lived in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], since at least 1730, before the town and county were organized. Joseph Simon was the best known of the first arrivals. Meyer Hart and Michael Hart were among the earlier settlers at [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], where they arrived previous to the Revolutionary War. A synagogue was established there in 1839. Shaefferstown had a few Jewish settlers at an early date, and a synagogue and cemetery in 1732. For a considerable number of years preceding the Revolutionary War a number of Jews of Pennsylvania were engaged in the exploitation and sale of western Pennsylvania lands. Among the more prominent of these were Jacob and David Franks, Barnard and Michael Gratz, Joseph Simon, and Levy Andrew Levy.\n\n==The American South==\n{{further|History of the Jews in Charleston, South Carolina}}\n\nThe Jewish settlement in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] dates almost from the very foundation of the colony; and the early history of Georgia is practically the history of the growth and development of Savannah, Jewish life centering in that city. It would appear that a movement was set on foot in London to settle some Jews in the colony even before [[James Oglethorpe]], in June, 1733, led his first band of followers to the point which soon after became the city of Savannah. The second vessel which reached the colony from England (on July 11, 1733) had among its passengers no less than forty Jewish emigrants. Although their arrival was unexpected, the liberal-minded governor welcomed them gladly, notwithstanding that he was aware that the trustees of the colony in England had expressed some opposition to permitting Jews to settle there. These first settlers were all of Spanish, Portuguese, and Prussian extraction, though within a year of their arrival others, who were apparently German Jews, also took up their residence there. These two bands of settlers received equally liberal treatment from Oglethorpe, and were the progenitors of one of the most important communities of Jews in the U.S. Many of their descendants are still living in various parts of the country. The first male white child born in the colony was a Jew, Philip (Uri) Minis on July 11, 1734.\n\nAmong the first immigrants was Dr. Nunis, who was made welcome because of his medical knowledge, and because he, with a number of others, brought sufficient wealth to the colony to enable the immigrants to take up large tracts of land. A congregation was organized as early as 1734. Three years later Abraham de Lyon, who had been a ''vigneron'' in Portugal, introduced the culture of grapes. The cultivation and manufacture of silk and the pursuit of agriculture and of commerce were the chief occupations of these early settlers. A dispute with the trustees of the colony respecting the introduction of slaves caused an extensive emigration to [[South Carolina]] in 1741, and resulted in the dissolution of the congregation. But in 1751 a number of Jews returned to Georgia, and in the same year the trustees sent over [[Joseph Ottolenghi]] to superintend the somewhat extensive silk-industry in the colony. Ottolenghi soon attained prominence in the political life of his associates, and was elected a member of the Assembly in 1761 and in succeeding years. There seems to have been little if any distinction made socially between the Jews and the other settlers, and educational and philanthropic institutions seem to have been supported by all alike.\n\nThe liberal charter which [[John Locke]] drew up in 1669 for the governance of the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] should have operated to attract Jews there at an early date, since \"Jews, heathen, and dissenters\" were by the terms of Locke's charter granted full liberty of conscience. Although political changes modified Locke's original plans considerably, the spirit of tolerance was always retained. Nevertheless, no Jews in any numbers appear to have come to [[South Carolina]] until the exodus from Georgia from 1740 to 1771, already referred to. However, one Simon Valentine, one of four Jews who applied for citizenship in 1697, became the first documented Jewish landowner, which entitled him to vote.<ref name=har>\"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/01/a-portion-of-the-people.html A \"portion of the People\"]\", Nell Porter Brown, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', January\u2013February, 2003</ref> A few others followed him, for in 1703 a protest was raised against \"Jew strangers\" voting in an election for members of the Assembly.\n\nIn 1748, some prominent London Jews set on foot a scheme for the acquisition of a tract of {{convert|200000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (809&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land in South Carolina. Nothing came of this, however, though on November 27, 1755, [[Joseph Salvador]] purchased {{convert|100000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (405&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land near Fort Ninety-six for \u00a32,000. Twenty years later Salvador sold {{convert|60000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (243&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land for \u00a33,000 to thirteen London Sephardic Jews. This land was known as the \"Jews' Lands.\" Another of the Salvadors ([[Francis Salvador]], the nephew of Joseph) purchased extensive tracts of land in the same vicinity in 1773\u201374.<ref name=har/> [[Moses Lindo]], likewise a London Jew, who arrived in 1756, became actively engaged in [[indigo]] manufacture,<ref name=har/> spending large sums in its development, and making this one of the principal industries of the state.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War the Jews of South Carolina were to be found on both sides; and the most eminent of the revolutionists was [[Francis Salvador]], who was elected a member of the First and Second Provincial Congresses which met 1775\u201376, the most important political office held by any Jew during the Revolution.<ref name=har/> Two-thirds of a company of militia commanded by [[Richard Lushington]] was made up of Charleston Jews.\n\nAfter the fall of Charleston in 1780 the majority of Jews left that city, but most of them returned at the close of the war. The Sephardic Jews established a congregation in 1750, and the Jews of German descent another shortly thereafter. In 1791, when the Sephardic congregation was incorporated, the total number of Jews in Charleston is estimated to have been 400.\n\nTo judge by names alone, it would appear that a few Jews wandered into [[Virginia]] as early as 1624. A small number seem also to have been there before the end of the seventeenth century, but for nearly 100 years no traces of Jewish settlement are found. At least one Jewish soldier&mdash;possibly two&mdash;served in Virginia regiments under Washington in his expedition across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] in 1754. It is probable that Jews drifted into the colony from Baltimore and other points in Maryland at an early date. By 1785, Richmond had a Jewish community of about a dozen families of Spanish-Portuguese descent, which organized a Sephardic congregation in 1791. This congregation remained in existence until 1898.\n\nA few Jews were among the traders who settled in [[Tennessee]], near the [[Holston River]], in 1778, but they were mere stragglers and made no permanent settlement.\n\nOf the remaining states of the southern group east of the [[Mississippi River]] the principal Jewish settlements have been made in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]]. An occasional Jew made his way into the territory which is now Alabama during the early part of the eighteenth century. One Pallachio became prominent in 1776.\n\nIt is likely that there were a few Jews in the Natchez district of Mississippi before the close of the eighteenth century, but no congregation was organized until that of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] was established in 1843.\n\n==In the American Revolution==\n\nBefore and during the American Revolutionary War the Jews had representatives of their people upon both sides of the controversy, though the majority joined the colonial side. On the [[Non-Importation Agreement]] of 1769 the names of not less than five Jews are found; this is also the case with respect to other agreements of a similar nature. The outbreak of the Revolutionary War dissolved the congregation in [[New York City|New York]]; and upon the eve of the British occupancy of the town the majority of the congregation, headed by [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]], took all the belongings of the synagogue and removed to [[Philadelphia]], where they established the first regular congregation, the Mickv\u00e9 Israel, in 1782. The small number who remained in New York occasionally held services in the synagogue. Most of those that left for Philadelphia returned to New York after the war. [[Haym Solomon]] or (Salomon), (1740\u20131785) was possibly the prime financier of the American side during the [[American War of Independence]] against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. He was born in [[Prussia]] and died in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].\n\nAlthough the Jews participated prominently in the events leading up to the Revolution, it would appear that even in the midst of absorbing political discussions they were able, in 1774, to start another congregation. They were not all, however, to be found on the colonial side during the war, for [[Mordecai Sheftall]], Levi Sheftall, Philip Jacob Cohen, Philip Minis, and Sheftall Sheftall were in the first days of the Revolution disqualified by the authorities from holding any office of trust in the province because of the pronounced revolutionary ideas which they advocated. The community was dispersed during the Revolution, but many Jews returned immediately after the close of the war.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonial history of the United States]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Notes==\n#{{note|Gans}} \"Joachim Gaunse.\" Jewish Virtual Library.

Franco was a scholar and agent for Immanuel Perada, a Dutch merchant. He delivered supplies to Edward Gibbons, a [[major general]] in the Massachusetts militia. After a dispute over who should pay Franco (Gibbons or Perada) the [[Massachusetts General Court]] ruled on May 6, 1649, that Franco was to be expelled from the colony, and granted him \"six shillings per week out of the Treasury for ten weeks, for sustenance, till he can get his passage to Holland.\"{{ref|Franco}}{{ref|Franco2}}\n\n===Solomon Pietersen===\nSolomon Pietersen was a merchant from Amsterdam who came to town in 1654. In 1656, Pietersen became the first known American Jew to [[interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarry]] with a [[Christianity|Christian]]; though there are no records showing Pietersen formally converted, his daughter Anna was [[Baptism|baptized]] in childhood.{{ref|Pietersen}}{{ref|Pietersen2}}{{ref|Pietersen3}}\n\n===Jacob Barsimson===\nOn July 8, 1654, [[Jacob Barsimson]] left Holland and arrived aboard ''Peartree'' on August 22 in the port of [[New Amsterdam]] (in [[Lower Manhattan]], where [[Wall Street]] is today). Barsimson was employed by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and had fled the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese settlements in the New World]], who had captured a formerly Dutch settlement and established the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] there.\n\n===Asser Levy===\n[[Asher Levy|Asser Levy (Van Swellem)]] is first mentioned in public records in [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654 in connection with the group of 23 Jews who arrived as refugees from [[Brazil]]. It is likely he preceded their arrival.  Levy was the (kosher) butcher for the small [[Congregation Shearith Israel|Jewish community]].  He fought for Jewish rights in the Dutch colony and is famous for having secured the right of Jews to be admitted as Burghers and to serve guard duty for the colony.\n\n==Dutch Brazilian Sephardi group==\n{{further|History of Pernambuco#Jews in Pernambuco|Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands}}\n\nThe [[Jewish arrival in New Amsterdam|first ''group'' of Jews in the northern colonies]] disembarked in early September 1654, shortly after Barsimson. Barsimson is said to have met them at [[Battery Park|The Battery]] upon their arrival. This group was made up of twenty-three [[Portuguese Jews]] from the Netherlands (four couples, two widows, and thirteen children). Like Barsimson, they had fled from a former Dutch settlement; the group had emigrated from [[Dutch Brazil]] after the settlement was conquered by the Portuguese. Fearing the Inquisition, the Jews left Recife. They originally docked in [[Spanish Jamaica]] and [[Spanish Cuba]], but the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] did not allow them to remain there. Their ship, ''Ste. Catherine'', went to New Amsterdam instead, settling against the wishes of local merchants and the local [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. Colonial governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]], upon complaint from these groups, attempted to have the Jews expelled. He wrote a letter to the directors of the [[Dutch West India Company]] dated September 22, 1654:\n\n<blockquote>The Jews who have arrived would nearly all like to remain here, but learning that they (with their customary [[usury]] and deceitful trading with the Christians) were very repugnant to the inferior magistrates, as also to the people having the most affection for you; the Deaconry also fearing that owing to their present indigence they might become a charge in the coming winter, we have, for the benefit of this weak and newly developing place and the land in general, deemed it useful to require them in a friendly way to depart, praying also most seriously in this connection, for ourselves as also for the general community of your worships, that the deceitful race&mdash;such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of [[Christ]]&mdash;be not allowed to further infect and trouble this new colony to the detraction of your worships and the dissatisfaction of your worships' most affectionate subjects.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, among the directors of the Dutch West India Company included several influential Jews, who interceded on the refugees' behalf. Company officials rebuffed Stuyvesant and ordered him in a letter dated April 26, 1655, to let the Jews remain in New Amsterdam, \"provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation\":\n\n<blockquote>We would have liked to effectuate and fulfill your wishes and request that the new territories should no more be allowed to be infected by people of the Jewish nation, for we foresee therefrom the same difficulties which you fear, but after having further weighed and considered the matter, we observe that this would be somewhat unreasonable and unfair, especially because of the considerable loss sustained by this nation, with others, in the taking of Brazil, as also because of the large amount of capital which they still have invested in the shares of this company. Therefore after many deliberations we have finally decided and resolved to apostille [annotate] upon a certain petition presented by said Portuguese Jews that these people may travel and trade to and in [[New Netherland]] and live and remain there, provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation. You will now govern yourself accordingly.</blockquote>\n\nUpon the capture of the colony by the English in 1664, the rights enjoyed by the Jews were not interfered with, and for twenty years they appear to have lived much as before the British occupation, though with slight increase in their numbers. Jews had previously been barred from settling in English colonies, as they had been banned from all English lands for 400 years. [[Oliver Cromwell]] (British Protector from 1649 through 1660, through his son Richard) lifted this prohibition, and founding of the first major Jewish settlement soon followed in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. In 1672, Rabba Couty attained prominence by his appeal to the [[King's Council]] in England from a decree passed against him by the courts of Jamaica, as a result of which one of his ships had been seized and declared forfeited. His appeal was successful and established the rights of Jews as British subjects. This appears to be the first case in which a colonial grant of [[naturalization]] was recognized as valid.\n\n==New York==\n{{further|History of the Jews in New York|Jews in New York City}}\n\nIn 1685, the application of Saul Brown (originally Saul Pardo) to trade at retail was denied, as was also that of the Jews for liberty to exercise their religion publicly. That they did so privately in some definite place of worship would appear from the fact that a map of New York, dated 1695, shows the location of a Jewish synagogue on [[Beaver Street (Manhattan)|Beaver Street]], also that Saul Brown was the minister, and that the congregation comprised twenty families. Five years later the site of the synagogue was so well known that in a conveyance of property the premises were referred to as a landmark. In 1710, the minister of the congregation, Abraham de Lucena, was granted exemption from civil and military service by reason of his ministerial functions, and reference is made to the enjoyment of the same privileges by his predecessors. The minutes of the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]] of New York begin in 1729, when it was located in Mill Street, and refer to records dating back as far as 1706. This congregation established on Mill Street, in 1730, on a lot purchased two years before, the first synagogue in the future [[United States]].\n\nIt would thus appear that the religious rights of these early Jewish settlers had been secured in the beginning of the 18th century, and that they enjoyed also many political rights. An act passed by the [[General Assembly of New York]] on November 15, 1727, provided that when the oath of abjuration was to be taken by any British subject professing the Jewish religion, the words \"upon the true faith of a Christian\" might be omitted. Three days later an act was passed naturalizing one Daniel Nunes da Costa. A bitter political controversy of 1737 resulted in the decision by the General Assembly that Jews should not be allowed to vote for members of that body.\n\nIn 1740, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Plantation Act 1740|Plantation Act]] specifically permitting Jews to be naturalized in [[British America|the colonies]]. Previous to this date, however, the New York Colonial Assembly had passed numerous special acts of naturalization, some of which were applicable to individuals only; others, more general in character, under which Jews could be naturalized without taking oath \"upon the true faith of a Christian,\" were also put upon the statute-book. Between this time and the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the Jewish community in this colony increased by slow stages, the principal immigrants coming from [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and the [[West Indies]].\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], Jacob Franks was the royal agent, in association with a British syndicate, for provisioning the British forces in America; his dealings with the crown during this period exceeded \u00a3750,000 in value.\n\n==Upstate New York settlement==\n{{main|History of the Jews in New York}}\n\nAlthough most of the earlier immigrants settled in New York City, a few settled beyond its limits, some even as far as the confines of what now constitutes the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1661, when [[Albany, New York|Albany]] was but a trading-post, Asser Levy owned real estate there, but between that date and the early years of the nineteenth century there are no records of any settlers in that town. They were not there in sufficient numbers to form a congregation until 1838, and they had no rabbi until 1846.\n\n==In New England==\n\nA group of Jews settled in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] in the late 1600s due to the official religious tolerance of the colony as established by [[Roger Williams]]. In other parts of [[New England]] there were probably occasional settlers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but the intolerance of the [[Puritans]] rendered impossible the establishment of any religious communities. According to several sources, [[Moses Simonson]], who settled in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] in 1621, may have had Dutch Jewish ancestry.<ref>Arthur Hertzberg, The Jews in America: Four Centuries of an Uneasy Encounter : a History (1997), pg. 22 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0231108419</ref><ref>American Jewish Historical Quarterly, Volume 1, pg 107\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=B6UyAQAAMAAJ (1893)</ref> An interesting personality is that of [[Judah Monis]], who became a convert to [[Christianity]] and filled the chair of Hebrew in [[Harvard College]] from 1722 until his death in 1764.\n\nMention is found of a Jew in [[Connecticut]] on November 9, 1659, and of another in 1670. The first Jewish family to settle in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] came in 1772, though a few individuals who had become converts to Christianity dwelt there a few years before. The first congregation was established about 1840, the congregants being members of about twenty [[Bavaria]]n families. From that date on the community increased by slow stages. There are Jewish settlements also in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Ansonia, Connecticut|Ansonia]], [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. The first congregation in Hartford was established in 1843. Since 1891, a number of Jewish farmers have been settled in various parts of the state.\n\nThe earliest mention of a Jew in [[Massachusetts]] bears the date May 3, 1649, and there are references to Jews among the inhabitants of [[Boston]] in 1695 and 1702; but they can be regarded only as stragglers, as no settlers made their homes in Massachusetts until the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] drove the Jews from [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]. In 1777, Aaron Lopez and Jacob Rivera, with fifty-nine others, went from Newport to [[Leicester, Massachusetts|Leicester]], and established themselves there; but this settlement did not survive the close of the war. A number of Jews, including the Hays family, settled at Boston before 1800. Of these [[Moses Michael Hays]] was the most important. In 1830, a number of [[Algerian Jews]] went to Boston, but they soon disappeared. The history of the present community begins with 1840, when the first congregation was established.\n\nThe Jewish immigrants to [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] have never been very numerous, though there are congregations in [[Burlington, Vermont]] and in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], and [[Dover, New Hampshire]]. Little of importance can be said about the communal life of the Jews in New England, and their numbers increased but slowly until after the beginning of the great Russian emigration in 1882, when the overflow from New York as well as the emigration through [[Canada]] commenced to stream into New England.\n\nThe opening up of the West and the resulting unprofitable nature of farming in New England drew away from this part of the United States many thrifty farmers, who abandoned their unfruitful fields for the more attractive opportunities in the western states. Of interest in connection with this shifting of the population is the fact that many of these abandoned farms, especially in Connecticut, have been taken up by [[Russian Jews]], who, principally as [[dairy farming|dairy farmers]], have added a new and useful element to the agricultural community.\n\n==Maryland==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Baltimore}}\n\nIt would seem that only a few Jews found their way to [[Maryland]] during the first half of the 17th century, and that the first settlers of this colony came as individuals, and not in considerable numbers at any time, as was the case in New York, Newport, [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. To judge by the names alone it would appear that a few Jews were resident in Maryland from the earliest days of the colony. The most prominent figure, who was unquestionably a Jew, was a Dr. [[Jacob Lumbrozo]], who had arrived January 24, 1656, and who, in 1658, was tried for blasphemy, but was released by reason of the general amnesty granted in honor of the accession of [[Richard Cromwell]] (March 3, 1658). Letters of denization were issued to Lumbrozo September 10, 1663. Besides practising medicine, he also owned a plantation, engaged in trade with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and had active intercourse with London merchants. He was one of the earliest medical practitioners in the colony, and his career casts much light upon the history and nature of religious tolerance in Maryland. By the strength of his personality he was able to disregard nearly all the laws which would have rendered his residence in the colony impossible, and he seems to have observed his faith even though this, under the laws, was forbidden. The unfavorable environment rendered the admittance of Jews to Maryland difficult, and until the [[Maryland Constitution of 1776|Constitution of 1776]] established the religious rights of all, few Jews settled in the colony.\n\n==Pennsylvania==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Pennsylvania}}\n{{main|History of the Jews in Philadelphia|History of the Jews in Pittsburgh}}\n\nIt is on record that Jews from New Amsterdam traded along the [[Delaware River]] as early as 1655. There were probably some settlers in the southeastern portion of the territory of which [[William Penn]] took possession in 1681. A very considerable number of the early Pennsylvania colonists were [[German Jews]]. The first Jewish resident of [[Philadelphia]] was Jonas Aaron, who was living there in 1703. Another early pioneer and one of considerable prominence was [[Isaac Miranda]]. He was the first to settle at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], at which place, as also at [[Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania|Shaefferstown]], there was an early Jewish immigration. Miranda became a convert to [[Christianity]] and held several state offices. A number of Jews settled in Philadelphia in the first half of the eighteenth century, and became prominent in the life of the city. Among these were [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], Joseph Marks, and Sampson Levy. The Non-Importation Resolutions of 1765 contained the signatures of eight Jews, an indication of the importance of the Jewish community at this time. As early as 1747 a number of persons held religious services in a small house in Sterling alley, and afterward in Cherry alley&mdash;between Third and Fourth streets. They were mostly German and [[Polish Jews]]; and their differences as to the liturgy to be followed prevented, at the time, the formation of any regular congregation. Attempts, indeed, were made in 1761 and 1773 to form one, but none was established until the influx of Jews from New York during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], with the arrival of [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]], gave the community sufficient strength to carry out this cherished object. A lot was purchased and a synagogue erected, the dedication occurring in September 1782. A number of Philadelphia Jews served in the army of the Revolution; and the inestimable services rendered by [[Haym Salomon]] to [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]] in the finances of the Revolution make his name stand out as the most prominent character in American Jewry.\n\nJews have lived in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], since at least 1730, before the town and county were organized. Joseph Simon was the best known of the first arrivals. Meyer Hart and Michael Hart were among the earlier settlers at [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], where they arrived previous to the Revolutionary War. A synagogue was established there in 1839. Shaefferstown had a few Jewish settlers at an early date, and a synagogue and cemetery in 1732. For a considerable number of years preceding the Revolutionary War a number of Jews of Pennsylvania were engaged in the exploitation and sale of western Pennsylvania lands. Among the more prominent of these were Jacob and David Franks, Barnard and Michael Gratz, Joseph Simon, and Levy Andrew Levy.\n\n==The American South==\n{{further|History of the Jews in Charleston, South Carolina}}\n\nThe Jewish settlement in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] dates almost from the very foundation of the colony; and the early history of Georgia is practically the history of the growth and development of Savannah, Jewish life centering in that city. It would appear that a movement was set on foot in London to settle some Jews in the colony even before [[James Oglethorpe]], in June, 1733, led his first band of followers to the point which soon after became the city of Savannah. The second vessel which reached the colony from England (on July 11, 1733) had among its passengers no less than forty Jewish emigrants. Although their arrival was unexpected, the liberal-minded governor welcomed them gladly, notwithstanding that he was aware that the trustees of the colony in England had expressed some opposition to permitting Jews to settle there. These first settlers were all of Spanish, Portuguese, and Prussian extraction, though within a year of their arrival others, who were apparently German Jews, also took up their residence there. These two bands of settlers received equally liberal treatment from Oglethorpe, and were the progenitors of one of the most important communities of Jews in the U.S. Many of their descendants are still living in various parts of the country. The first male white child born in the colony was a Jew, Philip (Uri) Minis on July 11, 1734.\n\nAmong the first immigrants was Dr. Nunis, who was made welcome because of his medical knowledge, and because he, with a number of others, brought sufficient wealth to the colony to enable the immigrants to take up large tracts of land. A congregation was organized as early as 1734. Three years later Abraham de Lyon, who had been a ''vigneron'' in Portugal, introduced the culture of grapes. The cultivation and manufacture of silk and the pursuit of agriculture and of commerce were the chief occupations of these early settlers. A dispute with the trustees of the colony respecting the introduction of slaves caused an extensive emigration to [[South Carolina]] in 1741, and resulted in the dissolution of the congregation. But in 1751 a number of Jews returned to Georgia, and in the same year the trustees sent over [[Joseph Ottolenghi]] to superintend the somewhat extensive silk-industry in the colony. Ottolenghi soon attained prominence in the political life of his associates, and was elected a member of the Assembly in 1761 and in succeeding years. There seems to have been little if any distinction made socially between the Jews and the other settlers, and educational and philanthropic institutions seem to have been supported by all alike.\n\nThe liberal charter which [[John Locke]] drew up in 1669 for the governance of the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] should have operated to attract Jews there at an early date, since \"Jews, heathen, and dissenters\" were by the terms of Locke's charter granted full liberty of conscience. Although political changes modified Locke's original plans considerably, the spirit of tolerance was always retained. Nevertheless, no Jews in any numbers appear to have come to [[South Carolina]] until the exodus from Georgia from 1740 to 1771, already referred to. However, one Simon Valentine, one of four Jews who applied for citizenship in 1697, became the first documented Jewish landowner, which entitled him to vote.<ref name=har>\"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/01/a-portion-of-the-people.html A \"portion of the People\"]\", Nell Porter Brown, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', January\u2013February, 2003</ref> A few others followed him, for in 1703 a protest was raised against \"Jew strangers\" voting in an election for members of the Assembly.\n\nIn 1748, some prominent London Jews set on foot a scheme for the acquisition of a tract of {{convert|200000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (809&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land in South Carolina. Nothing came of this, however, though on November 27, 1755, [[Joseph Salvador]] purchased {{convert|100000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (405&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land near Fort Ninety-six for \u00a32,000. Twenty years later Salvador sold {{convert|60000|acres|0|abbr=on}} (243&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land for \u00a33,000 to thirteen London Sephardic Jews. This land was known as the \"Jews' Lands.\" Another of the Salvadors ([[Francis Salvador]], the nephew of Joseph) purchased extensive tracts of land in the same vicinity in 1773-74.<ref name=har/> [[Moses Lindo]], likewise a London Jew, who arrived in 1756, became actively engaged in [[indigo]] manufacture,<ref name=har/> spending large sums in its development, and making this one of the principal industries of the state.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War the Jews of South Carolina were to be found on both sides; and the most eminent of the revolutionists was [[Francis Salvador]], who was elected a member of the First and Second Provincial Congresses which met 1775-76, the most important political office held by any Jew during the Revolution.<ref name=har/> Two-thirds of a company of militia commanded by [[Richard Lushington]] was made up of Charleston Jews.\n\nAfter the fall of Charleston in 1780 the majority of Jews left that city, but most of them returned at the close of the war. The Sephardic Jews established a congregation in 1750, and the Jews of German descent another shortly thereafter. In 1791, when the Sephardic congregation was incorporated, the total number of Jews in Charleston is estimated to have been 400.\n\nTo judge by names alone, it would appear that a few Jews wandered into [[Virginia]] as early as 1624. A small number seem also to have been there before the end of the seventeenth century, but for nearly 100 years no traces of Jewish settlement are found. At least one Jewish soldier&mdash;possibly two&mdash;served in Virginia regiments under Washington in his expedition across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] in 1754. It is probable that Jews drifted into the colony from Baltimore and other points in Maryland at an early date. By 1785, Richmond had a Jewish community of about a dozen families of Spanish-Portuguese descent, which organized a Sephardic congregation in 1791. This congregation remained in existence until 1898.\n\nA few Jews were among the traders who settled in [[Tennessee]], near the [[Holston River]], in 1778, but they were mere stragglers and made no permanent settlement.\n\nOf the remaining states of the southern group east of the [[Mississippi River]] the principal Jewish settlements have been made in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]]. An occasional Jew made his way into the territory which is now Alabama during the early part of the eighteenth century. One Pallachio became prominent in 1776.\n\nIt is likely that there were a few Jews in the Natchez district of Mississippi before the close of the eighteenth century, but no congregation was organized until that of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] was established in 1843.\n\n==In the American Revolution==\n\nBefore and during the American Revolutionary War the Jews had representatives of their people upon both sides of the controversy, though the majority joined the colonial side. On the [[Non-Importation Agreement]] of 1769 the names of not less than five Jews are found; this is also the case with respect to other agreements of a similar nature. The outbreak of the Revolutionary War dissolved the congregation in [[New York City|New York]]; and upon the eve of the British occupancy of the town the majority of the congregation, headed by [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]], took all the belongings of the synagogue and removed to [[Philadelphia]], where they established the first regular congregation, the Mickv\u00e9 Israel, in 1782. The small number who remained in New York occasionally held services in the synagogue. Most of those that left for Philadelphia returned to New York after the war. [[Haym Solomon]] or (Salomon), (1740\u20131785) was possibly the prime financier of the American side during the [[American War of Independence]] against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. He was born in [[Prussia]] and died in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].\n\nAlthough the Jews participated prominently in the events leading up to the Revolution, it would appear that even in the midst of absorbing political discussions they were able, in 1774, to start another congregation. They were not all, however, to be found on the colonial side during the war, for [[Mordecai Sheftall]], Levi Sheftall, Philip Jacob Cohen, Philip Minis, and Sheftall Sheftall were in the first days of the Revolution disqualified by the authorities from holding any office of trust in the province because of the pronounced revolutionary ideas which they advocated. The community was dispersed during the Revolution, but many Jews returned immediately after the close of the war.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonial history of the United States]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Notes==\n#{{note|Gans}} \"Joachim Gaunse.\" Jewish Virtual Library.

Homer suggests the group attempt to track down Corrie and Kevin. They release a smoke bomb into the hospital and investigate during the evacuation. They discover that Corrie is comatose and that Kevin was beaten when he arrived.\n\nFresh from the discovery of what had happened to their friends, the group agrees to make an attack on the convoys on the highway to Cobbler's Bay. While preparing their ambush, the group is surprised by a small patrol. Homer kills one soldier and injures another with a sawed-off shotgun at close quarters before going into shock. A third, and final, soldier panics and flees into the bush away from the highway leaving their pack and rifle behind. Ellie takes charge of the situation, kills the wounded soldier and makes the decision to continue on with the attack. The attack succeeds and the group return to Hell.\n\nThey decide that their next course of action should be to investigate the other paths in and out of Hell to determine where they lead. Chris, however, decides not to go and to stay behind instead. Their exploration leads them to a group of free Australians called \"Harvey's Heroes\" led by former school principal and army reservist Major Harvey. He refuses to allow any portion of the group to return to Hell to find Chris. Although Harvey brags about having made several attacks on the enemy, these attacks are revealed to be low-risk acts. The group is invited to spectate as Harvey's Heroes destroy an abandoned tank, but they are led into an enemy ambush and have to flee from the scene. Fi is chased by an enemy soldier. Homer and Ellie ambush and incapacitate the man as he prepares to rape Fi but cannot bring themselves to kill him when they discover that he is a teenager like themselves. Lee arrives and stabs the soldier in the heart, disturbing the others.\n\nWhen they return to Hell to find Chris absent and then head into Wirrawee. The group take refuge in Robyn's music teacher's house, where Ellie and Lee consummate their relationship for the first time. They move on to a church, where they keep watch over some of the early colonists. Here they discover that Major Harvey, presumed dead in the ambush, is now working directly with the enemy. Reeling from this discovery, they arrange to blow up several of the houses.\n\nThe attack is successful, but on their way back to Hell they see an overturned vehicle near a dam; further investigation reveals that Chris had overturned the car and died weeks ago.

It has continued to the present. Following the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany in May 1940, the Jewish community was severely persecuted. About 70% of its members were killed by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Holocaust]] during World War II.\n\nThe area now known as the [[Netherlands]] was once part of the [[Spanish Empire]] but in 1581, the [[Dutch Republic|northern Dutch provinces]] declared independence. A principal motive was the wish to practice [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christianity, then [[Spanish Inquisition|forbidden under Spanish rule]]. Religious tolerance was effectively an important constitutional element of the newly independent state. This inevitably attracted the attention of Jews who were religiously oppressed in different parts of the world.  In pursuit of religious freedoms, many Jews migrated to the Netherlands where they flourished.  \n\nDuring the German Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, 70 percent of the Jewish population of the Netherlands was killed during the Holocaust, which included deportation to concentration and extermination camps.\n\n==History of Jews in the Netherlands==\n\n===Early history===\n\nIt was likely that the earliest Jews arrived in the \"Low Countries\", present-day Belgium and the Netherlands, during the Roman conquest early in the common era. Little is known about these early settlers, other than they were not very numerous. For some time, the Jewish presence consisted of, at most, small isolated communities and scattered families. Reliable documentary evidence dates only from the 1100s; for several centuries, the record reflects that the Jews were persecuted within the region and expelled on a regular basis. Early sources from the 11th and 12th centuries mention official debates or disputations between Christians and Jews, in which attempts were made to convince the Jews of the truth of Christianity and to try to convert them. They were documented in the other provinces at an earlier date, especially after their expulsion from [[History of the Jews in France|France]] in 1321 and the persecutions in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and the Rhine provinces. The first Jews in the province of [[Gelderland]] were reported in 1325. Jews have been settled in [[Nijmegen]], the oldest settlement, in [[Doesburg]], [[Zutphen]], and in [[Arnhem]] since 1404. As of the 13th century, there are sources that indicate that Jews were living in Brabant and Limburg, mainly in cities such as Brussels, Leuven, Tienen, and Maastricht. Sources from the 14th century also mention Jewish residents in the cities of Antwerp and Mechelen and in the northern region of Geldern.\n\nBetween 1347 and 1351, Europe was hit by the plague or [[Black Death]]. This resulted in a new theme in medieval anti-Semitic rhetoric. The Jews were held responsible for the epidemic and for the way it was rapidly spreading, because presumably they were the ones who had poisoned the water of springs used by the Christians. Various medieval chronicles mention this, e.g., those of Radalphus de Rivo (c. 1403) of Tongeren, who wrote that Jews were murdered in the Brabant region and in the city of Zwolle because they were accused of spreading the Black Death. This accusation was added to other traditional [[blood libels]] against the Jews. They were accused of piercing the Host used for communion and killing Christian children to use as a blood offering during [[Passover]]. Local Jewish communities were often murdered in part or entirely, or exiled in hysterical pogroms. In May 1370, six Jews were burned at the stake in Brussels because they were accused of theft and of desecrating the Holy Sacrament.\nIn addition, documentation can be found of instances in which Jews were abused and insulted, e.g., in the cities of Zutphen, Deventer, and Utrecht, for allegedly desecrating the Host. Rioters massacred the majority of the Jews in the region and expelled those who survived. \n\nIn 1349 the Duke of [[Guelders]] was authorized by the [[Emperor Louis IV]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire of Germany]] to receive Jews in his duchy, where they provided services, paid a tax, and were protected by the law. In Arnhem, where a Jewish physician is mentioned, the magistrate defended him against the hostilities of the populace. When Jews settled in the diocese of Utrecht is unknown, but rabbinical records regarding [[kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] speculated that the Jewish community there dated to Roman times. In 1444, Jews were expelled from the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Until 1789 Jews were prohibited from staying in the city overnight. They were tolerated in the village of [[Maarssen]], two hours distant, though their condition was not fortuitous. But, the community of Maarssen was one of the most important Jewish settlements in the Netherlands. Jews were admitted to Zeeland by Albert, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nIn 1477, by the marriage of [[Mary of Burgundy]] to the Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], the Netherlands were united to Austria, and its possessions passed to the crown of Spain. In the sixteenth century, owing to the persecutions of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Philip II of Spain]], the Netherlands became involved in a series of desperate and heroic struggles against this growing political and Catholic religious hegemony. In 1522, Charles V issued a proclamation in Gelderland and Utrecht against Christians who were suspected of being lax [[Roman Catholic Church|in the faith]], as well as against Jews who had not been baptized. He repeated such edicts in 1545 and 1549, trying to suppress the [[Protestant Reformation]], which was expanding. In 1571 the Duke of Alba notified the authorities of Arnhem that all Jews living there should be seized and held until their fates were determined. \n\nAt Dutch request, [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Mattias]] established religious peace in most of the provinces, which was later guaranteed by article 13 of the 1579 ''[[Union of Utrecht|Unie van Utrecht]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/cons/dutch/Union_Utrecht_1579.html|title=Union of Utrecht 1579}}</ref> Moreover, in 1581, the deputies of the United Provinces declared independence by issuing the [[Act of Abjuration]], which deposed Philip as their sovereign. As a consequence of these two events, Jews persecuted in Spain and Portugal turned toward the Dutch Republic as a place of refuge.\n\n===Sephardim===\n\n''Sephardim'' or [[Sephardic Jews]] (sometimes referred to as ''[[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]]'') were native to ''Sepharad'', the Hebrew name for [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. They had been expelled or were forced to convert to Catholicism in the late 15th century through the Spanish [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492, and later the [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|Portuguese Edicts]] of 1496 and 1497. Many still remained in the [[Iberian peninsula]], practicing either their [[New Christians|new religion]] in public and Judaism in secret, or both (see [[anusim]], [[crypto-Jews]], or [[Marranos]]). The newly independent and tolerant Dutch provinces provided more favourable conditions for observant Jews to establish a community, and to practice their religion openly. The Rabbi of the Portuguese-Spanish Synagogue in Amsterdam, still in use today, was Abraham Cohen Pimentel (died March 21, 1697). The services are still held in the Portuguese language. The Portuguese Jews migrated most notably to the city of [[Amsterdam]]. As they became established, they collectively brought new trading expertise and connections to the city. They also brought navigation knowledge and techniques from Portugal, which enabled the Netherlands to start competing in overseas trade with the Spanish and Portuguese colonies.\n\nAfter having been refused admission to [[Middelburg]] and [[Haarlem]], these [[Anusim]] arrived in Amsterdam in 1593. Among them were skilled artisans, physicians and prominent merchants such as [[Jacob Tirado]], who obtained permission from the authorities to practice Judaism within his household. Those \"Jews of the Portuguese Nation\" worked in common cause with the people of Amsterdam and contributed materially to the prosperity of the country; they were strong supporters of the [[House of Orange]] and were protected by the Stadholder. During the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], the commerce of the Dutch Republic increased considerably, and a period of strong development ensued. This was particularly true for Amsterdam, where the Marranos had established their main port and base of operations. They maintained foreign trade relationships in the Mediterranean, including Venice, the Levant and Morocco. The Emperor of Morocco had an ambassador at [[The Hague]] named [[Samuel Pallache]], through whose mediation, in 1620, a commercial understanding was reached with the [[Barbary States]].\n\nThe Sephardic Jews of Amsterdam also established trade relationships with other countries in Europe. In the early 1620s numerous Jews migrated from Holland to the Lower Elbe region.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''European Jewry in the Age of Mercantilism 1550\u20131750'', p.92</ref> In a letter dated 25 November 1622, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] invited Jews of Amsterdam to settle in [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]], where, among other privileges, they were assured the free exercise of their religion.\n\nThe trade developed between the Dutch and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish South America]] was established by such Iberian Jews. They also contributed to establishing the [[Dutch West Indies Company]] in 1621, and some of them sat on its directorate. The ambitious schemes of the Dutch for the conquest of Brazil were carried into effect by Francisco Ribeiro, a Portuguese captain, who is said to have had Jewish relations in Holland. The Sephardic Jews of Amsterdam strongly supported the Dutch Republic in its struggle with Portugal for the possession of Brazil, which started in Recife with the arrival of Count Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen in 1637. Some years later, the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch in Brazil]] appealed for more craftsmen of all kinds, and many Jews heeded the call. In 1642 about 600 Jews left Amsterdam for Brazil, accompanied by two distinguished scholars, [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]] and [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]]. After the loss of the Dutch colony of Recife to the Portuguese in 1654, they sought refuge in other Dutch colonies, including the island of [[Cura\u00e7ao]] in the Caribbean and [[New Amsterdam]] (Manhattan) in North America.\n\n[[File:SPAmster.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Interior of the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]], the synagogue for the Portuguese-Israelite ([[Sephardic]]) community. It was inaugurated 2 August 1675, and is still in use by the Jewish community.]]\nBesides merchants, many physicians were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam. These included Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family. Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice in April, 1623. Jews were admitted as students to the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science that was of practical use to them. They were not allowed to practice law, because lawyers were required to take a Christian oath, thereby excluding them. Jews were also excluded from the trade guilds, as in a 1632 resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam (the Dutch cities were largely autonomous). However, they were allowed to practice certain trades: printing, bookselling, and selling meat, poultry, groceries, and medicines. In 1655 a Sephardic Jew was exceptionally permitted to establish a sugar refinery using chemical methods. \n\nSeveral Sephardic Jews stood out during that time, including [[Menasseh Ben Israel]]. He was known for corresponding widely with Christian leaders and helped to promote [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|Jewish resettlement in England]]. Perhaps the most famous among Dutch Jews of Sephardic origin is [[Benedictus de Spinoza]] (Baruch Spinoza), a philosopher, scholar and optician who was excommunicated from the Jewish community in 1656 after speaking out his ideas concerning (the nature of) God, later published in his famous work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics Demonstrated in Geometrical Order]]'' (1677).\n\n===Ashkenazim===\n\nMany [[Ashkenazi Jews|German Jews]] were also attracted later to the tolerant and independent Dutch provinces, generally after the mid-17th century. Unlike the more acculturated Iberian Jews, most of these were displaced residents of [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos]] escaping persecution. In addition they were displaced by the violence of the [[Thirty Year War]] (1618\u20131648) in other parts of northern Europe, and local expulsions, as well as the 1648 [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in Poland. These poor immigrants were less welcomed. Their arrival in considerable number threatened the economic status of Amsterdam in particular, and with few exceptions they were turned away. They generally settled in rural areas, where they subsisted typically as [[peddler]]s and [[Hawker (trade)|hawker]]s. Many [[Mediene|smaller Jewish communities]] were started throughout the Dutch provinces.\n\nOver time, many German Jews gained prosperity through retail trading and they became specialists in diamond-cutting and sales. They had a monopoly in the latter trade until about 1870. When [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]] was proclaimed stadholder (1747), the Jews found another protector. He had close relations with the head of the DePinto family, at whose villa, Tulpenburg, near [[Ouderkerk]], he and his wife paid more than one visit. In 1748, when a French army was at the frontier and the treasury was empty, De Pinto collected a large sum and presented it to the state. Van Hogendorp, the secretary of state, wrote to him: \"You have saved the state.\" In 1750 De Pinto arranged for the conversion of the national debt from a 4 to a 3% basis.\n\nUnder the government of [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], the country was troubled by internal dissensions. But the Jews remained loyal to him. As he entered the legislature on the day of his majority, 8 March 1766, in the synagogues services of thanks-giving were held. William V visited both the German and the Portuguese synagogues on 3 June 1768. He also attended the marriages of offspring of various prominent Jewish families.\n\n===French Revolution and Napoleon===\n\nThe year 1795 brought the results of the French Revolution to the Netherlands, including emancipation for the Jews. The National Convention, on 2 September 1796, proclaimed this resolution: \"No Jew shall be excluded from rights or advantages which are associated with citizenship in the Batavian Republic, and which he may desire to enjoy.\" Moses Moresco was appointed member of the municipality at Amsterdam; Moses Asser member of the court of justice there. The old conservatives, at whose head stood the chief rabbi Jacob Moses L\u00f6wenstamm, were not desirous of emancipation rights. Indeed, these rights were for the greater part of doubtful advantage; their culture was not so far advanced that they could frequent ordinary society; besides, this emancipation was offered to them by a party which had expelled their beloved [[Prince of Orange]], to whose house they remained so faithful that the chief rabbi at The Hague, Saruco, was called the \"Orange dominie\"; the men of the old r\u00e9gime were even called \"Orange cattle\". Nevertheless, the Revolution appreciably ameliorated the condition of the Jews; in 1799 their congregations received, like the Christian congregations, grants from the treasury. In 1798 [[Jonas Daniel Meijer]] interceded with the French minister of foreign affairs in behalf of the [[Jews of Germany]]; and on 22 Aug. 1802, the Dutch ambassador, [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck|Schimmelpenninck]], delivered a note on the same subject to the French minister.\n\nFrom 1806 to 1810 the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was ruled by [[Louis Bonaparte]], whose intention it was to so amend the condition of the Jews that their newly acquired rights would become of real value to them; the shortness of his reign, however, prevented him from carrying out his plans. For example, after having changed the market-day in some cities (Utrecht and [[Rotterdam]]) from Saturday to Monday, he abolished the use of the \"[[Oath More Judaico]]\" in the courts of justice, and administered the same formula to both Christians and Jews. To accustom the latter to military services he formed two battalions of 803 men and 60 officers, all Jews, who had been until then excluded from military service, even from the town guard.\n\nThe union of Ashkenazim and Sephardim intended by Louis Napoleon did not come about. He had desired to establish schools for Jewish children, who were excluded from the public schools; even the [[Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen]], founded in 1784, did not willingly receive them or admit Jews as members. Among the distinguished Jews of this period were Meier Littwald Lehemon, [[:nl:Mozes Salomon Asser|Mozes Salomon Asser]], [[Abraham Capadose|Capadose]], and the physicians [[David Heilbron]], Davids (who introduced [[vaccination]]), Stein van Laun ([[tellurium]]), and many others.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnZJAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA387#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Geschiedenis der Joden in Nederland (History of the Jews in the Netherlands) p.387 | publisher=Bij C. van der Post Jr. | year=1843 | accessdate=31 January 2012 | author=Koenen, Hendrik Jakob | page=519}}</ref>\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\n[[File:Veghel Synagogue.JPG|thumb|The synagogue in the town of [[Veghel]]. The community in Veghel was a small ''mediene'' community, which reached its height around 1900. In the years following, the community shrank to some 30 members as people moved to larger cities. All Jews in the town were killed during the Holocaust.]]\n\nOn 30 November 1813, [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI]] arrived at [[Scheveningen]], and on 11 December he was solemnly crowned as King William I.\n\nChief Rabbi Lehmans of The Hague organized a special thanksgiving service, asking for protection for the allied armies on 5 January 1814. Many Jews fought at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], where thirty-five Jewish officers died. William VI  promulgated a law abolishing the French r\u00e9gime. The Jews prospered in the independent Netherlands throughout the 19th century. By 1900, Amsterdam had 51,000 Jews, with 12,500 paupers; The Hague 5,754 Jews, with 846; Rotterdam 10,000, with 1,750; Groningen 2,400, with 613; Arnhem 1,224 with 349.<ref>''Joodsche Courant'', 1903, No. 44</ref> The total population of the Netherlands in 1900 was 5,104,137, about 2% of whom were Jews.\n\nThe Netherlands, and Amsterdam in particular, remained a major Jewish population centre until World War II. Amsterdam was known as [[Jerusalem of the West]] by its Jewish residents. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the community grew as Jews from the ''[[mediene]]'' (the \"country\" Jews), migrated to larger cities to seek better jobs and living conditions. \n\nBoundaries between Gentiles and Jews started 1) to blur due to increase in Gentile-Jewish marriages and residential spreading, 2) to cross due to a decrease in observance of religious practices like Sabbath and eating kosher food, and 3) to shift as civic involvement and political participation increased.<ref name=\"Peter Tammes 2017 477\u2013504\">{{Cite journal|last=Peter Tammes|first=Peter Scholten|date=2017|title= Assimilation of Ethnic-Religious Minorities in the Netherlands: A Historical-Sociological Analysis of Pre\u2013World War II Jews and Contemporary Muslims|journal= Social Science History|volume=41|issue=3|pages= 477\u2013504|doi= 10.1017/ssh.2017.12|hdl=1983/5c2863c8-a1aa-4d2a-9552-e47cad56a1c3|url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/76554129/accepted_revised_SSH_manuscript_Tammes_Scholten.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDutch Jews were a relatively small part of the population and showed a strong tendency towards internal migration.  They never coalesced into a real pillar.

The Netherlands was not under a military regime. It was the most densely inhabited country of Western Europe, making it difficult for the relatively large number of Jews to go into hiding. Most Jews in Amsterdam were poor, which limited their options for flight or hiding. The country did not have much open space or woods for people to flee to. Also, the civil administration had detailed records that indicated the numbers of Jews, and where they lived. The average citizen of the Netherlands was unaware of the operation of \"death camps\", such as Mauthausen for the majority of the occupation. All Dutch citizens were obligated to \"register\" and undertake work in Germany.<ref>Ettie Huizing, ''Wie het geweten heeft, het levensverhaal van Siep Adema,'' SUN 1994, {{ISBN|90-6168-425-0}}</ref>  When the Dutch recognised German persecution of the Jews in the Netherlands, they conducted the first act of mass civil disobedience in occupied Europe during WWII: the ''Februaristaking'' (\u201c[[February strike]]\u201d), in order to show their support for Jewish citizens.\n\nOne theory is that the Germans made use of the administrative organizations and Dutch police: \n<blockquote>\"In their preparations for the extermination of the Jews living in The Netherlands, the Germans could count on the assistance of the greater part of the Dutch administrative infrastructure. The occupiers had to employ only a relatively limited number of their own personnel; Dutch policemen rounded up the families to be sent to their deaths in Eastern Europe. Trains of the Dutch railways staffed by Dutch employees transported the Jews to camps in the Netherlands which were transit points to Auschwitz, Sobibor, and other death camps.\" With respect to Dutch collaboration, [[Eichmann]] is quoted as saying \"The transports run so smoothly that it is a pleasure to see.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp412.htm |title=Wartime and Postwar Dutch Attitudes Toward the Jews: Myth and Truth |author=Manfred Gerstenfeld |publisher=Jcpa.org |date=1999-08-15 |accessdate=2012-05-01|author-link=Manfred Gerstenfeld }}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Amsterdam Anne Frank.jpg|thumb|left|220px|This [[statue]] in Amsterdam commemorates [[Anne Frank]], a Jewish girl who went into hiding with her family during the Second World War. They were found and transported. Her father survived and later published her diary. (She is presumably represented by a stone at Westerbork.)]]\n\nDuring the first year of the occupation of the Netherlands, Jews, who were already registered on basis of their faith with the authorities (just as Protestants, Catholics and others were), had to get a large \"J\" stamped in their IDs. Every Dutch resident had to declare whether or not they had \"Jewish\" roots. The Germans banned Jews from certain occupations and isolated them from public life. Starting in January 1942, some Dutch Jews were forced to move to Amsterdam; others were directly deported to [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]], a transit and concentration camp near the small village of [[Hooghalen]]. Westerbork was founded in 1939 by the Dutch government as the Central Refugee Camp to give shelter to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution following ''[[Kristallnacht]]''. After the German occupation of the Netherlands in 1940, it became a transit camp for Jews who were being deported to the [[Nazi concentration camps]] in Middle and Eastern Europe, and later to extermination camps. Nearly all the prisoners who left Westerbork for the east died in the Holocaust before the end of World War II.\n\nAll non-Dutch Jews were also sent to Westerbork. In addition, over 15,000 Jews were sent to labour camps. Deportations of Jews from the Netherlands to [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|German-occupied Poland]] and Germany began on 15 June 1942 and ended on 13 September 1944. Ultimately some 101,000 Jews were deported in 98 transports from Westerbork to [[Auschwitz]] (57,800; 65 transports), [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] (34,313; 19 transports), [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] (3,724; 8 transports) and [[Theresienstadt]] (4,466; 6 transports), where most of them were murdered. Another 6,000 Jews were deported from other locations (like [[Vught]]) in the Netherlands to concentration camps in Germany, Poland and Austria (like [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]). Only 5,200 survived. The Dutch underground hid an estimated number of Jews of some 25,000\u201330,000; eventually, an estimated 16,500 Jews managed to survive the war by hiding. Some 7,000 to 8,000 survived by fleeing to countries like Spain, the United Kingdom, and [[Switzerland]], or by being married to non-Jews (which saved them from deportation and possible death). At the same time, there was substantial collaboration with the Nazis from members of the Dutch population, including the Amsterdam city administration, the Dutch municipal police, and Dutch railway workers, who all helped to round up and deport Jews.\n\nOne of the best known Holocaust victims in the Netherlands is [[Anne Frank]]. Along with her sister, [[Margot Frank]], she died from [[typhus]] in March 1945 in the [[concentration camp]] of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Disease was widespread because of unsanitary living conditions and confinement by the Nazis. Anne Frank's mother, [[Edith Frank-Holl\u00e4nder]], was starved to death by the Nazis in [[Auschwitz]]. Her father, [[Otto Frank]], survived the war. Other noted Dutch victims of the Holocaust include [[Etty Hillesum]], whose writings were later published;<ref>Frank, Evelyne.

From 1940\u20131941, an estimated 100 Jews were sent from German prisons to different concentration camps, then to Auschwitz. Over 2,000 Jews were taken from occupied France and Belgium to Auschwitz. 100 lived. From July 15, 1942 to February 23rd, 1943 an estimated 42,915 Jews were deported from [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Only 85 survived.

Along with her diary, Etty also wrote letters from Westerbork camp. Partially published in Dutch resistance newspapers while she was alive, her letters were later published posthumously. These letters detail the conditions at Westerbork, and the transport of Jews to extermination camps. On July 10, 1943, Hillesum wrote a letter from Westerbork that discussed what she recognised as her parents' inevitable transport to an eastern camp and their likely deaths.<ref>Hillesum, Etty.

Hillesum died at Auschwitz on or around November 30, 1943. Jopie, a friend from Westerbork, wrote to Hillesum's friends about Etty's mood at deportation.

She organised the first train transport of 600 Jewish children from [[Vienna]] in December 1938, after direct negotiations with [[Adolf Eichmann]] in the city, and the ultimate children's transport [[Kindertransport]], on 14 May 1940, from the Netherlands with 74 children on board the last ship leaving the country, the SS Bodegraven. Per 2014 her role in the Kindertransporte is slowly gaining recognition in English-speaking countries. A new fictionalized book on her life, 'The Last Train to London' (2019) by [[Meg Waite Clayton]], was being translated into 22 languages, including Dutch. Mrs Wijsmuller was one of the founders of the [[Anne Frank Foundation]] in Amsterdam, serving under Otto Frank as president. A bust in Bach Square in Amsterdam honours her memory.\n\n===1945\u20131960===\nThe Jewish-Dutch population after the Second World War is marked by certain significant changes: disappointment; emigration; a low birth rate; and a high intermarriage rate. After the Second World War and the Holocaust, returning Jews and Jews who had survived the often difficult hidden living ('diving') met with total lack of understanding of their fate and had to endure lasting loss of property. Especially mental health care was lacking and only started to develop from 1960 onwards in the Sinai centrum in Amersfoort. From 1973 professor Bastiaans tried to treat Holocaust victims with [[LSD]] in the Centrum '45 in Oegstgeest, attached to the Leyden University. This brought little succes, if any.  Understanding started to grow by a series of four TV documentaries on the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands made by the Jewish historian dr Lou de Jong, broadcast on Dutch national public TV (NTS, then the sole TV channel). The first four installments aired in 1960, were considered a turning point and left many Dutch, who until then had hardly had any notion of the gruesome depth of the Holocaust, aghast. The series continued through 1964. Dr De Jong subsequently published a 14 part, 29 volume history of the Netherlands during WW-II. \n\nIn 1965 the Jewish professor of history  [[Jaques Presser]] published his magister opus 'Ondergang' ('Demise - the Persecution and Eradication of Dutch Jewry'). The work was reprinted six times during its first year, reaching the relatively incredible print run of 150,000 - still today a record in the history of publishing in the Netherlands.\n\nNevertheless, as a result of the lack of understanding, mental and physical health problems, too many missing relatives and general administrational difficulties, thousands of surviving Jews emigrated, or made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]], later [[Israel]]. Aliyah from the Netherlands initially surpassed that of any other Western nation. Israel is still home to some 6,000 Dutch Jews. Others emigrated to the [[United States]]. There was a high assimilation and intermarriage rate among those who stayed. As a result, the Jewish birth rate and organized community membership dropped. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the sharp increase of understanding for the shoah, relations with non-Jews were gradually friendly. The Jewish community received reparations payments from the Dutch government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/netherlands.html |title=Netherlands: Virtual Jewish History Tour |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref>. Also reparations from Germany (aka 'Wiedergutmachung') started to trickle down into Dutch Jewish households.\n\nIn 1947, two years after the end of the Second World War in the Netherlands, the total number of Jews as counted in the population census was just 14,346 (less than 10 percent of the count of 154,887 by the Nazi occupation force in 1941). Later, this number was adjusted by Jewish organisations to some 24,000 Jews living in the Netherlands in 1954. This was a huge loss compared to the number of Jews counted in 1941. This latter number was disputed, as the Nazi occupation force counted Jews on their classification of race. They included hundreds of Christians of Jewish heritage in the Nazi census.

Smaller, independent synagogues exist as\nwell.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Orthodox Judaism===\nMost affiliated Jews in the Netherlands (Jews part of a Jewish community) are affiliated to the ''[[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]'' (Dutch Israelite Church) (NIK), which can be classified as part of (Ashkenazi) [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The NIK has approximately 5,000 members, spread over 36 congregations (of whom 13 are in Amsterdam and surroundings) in four jurisdictions (Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and the Interprovincial Rabbinate). It is larger than the Union of Liberal Synagogues (LJG) and thirteen times as large as the Portuguese Israelite Religious Community (PIK). The NIK was founded in 1814. At its height in 1877, it represented 176 Jewish communities. By World War II, it had  139 communities; it is made up of 36 congregations today. Besides governing some 36 congregations, the NIK has responsibility for the operation of more than 200 Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands (the total is 250).\n\nIn 1965 Rabbi [[Meir Just]] was appointed Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands, a position he held until his death in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-chief-rabbi-meir-just-dies-aged-101 |title=Dutch Chief Rabbi Meir Just dies aged 101 &#124; Radio Netherlands Worldwide |publisher=Rnw.nl |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323155626/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-chief-rabbi-meir-just-dies-aged-101 |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe small ''[[Portugees-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]'' (Portuguese Israelite Religious Community) (PIK), which is Sephardic in practice, has a membership of some 270 families. It is concentrated in Amsterdam. It was founded in 1870, although Sephardic Jews had long been in the city. Throughout history, Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands, in contrast to their Ashkenazi co-religionists, have settled mostly in a few communities: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, [[Naarden]] and Middelburg. Only the congregation in Amsterdam survived the Holocaust with enough members to maintain its activities. \n\nThree Jewish schools are located in Amsterdam, all situated in the Buitenveldert neighbourhood (Rosh Pina, Maimonides and Cheider). Cheider is affiliated with [[Haredi]] Orthodox Judaism. Chabad has eleven rabbis, in Almere, Amersfoort, Amstelveen, Amsterdam, Haarlem, Maastricht, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. The head ''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'' in the Netherlands are rabbis I. Vorst and Binyomin Jacobs. The latter is [[chief rabbi]] of the Interprovinciaal Opperrabbinaat (the Dutch Rabbinical Organisation)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipor.nl |title=ipor.nl |publisher=ipor.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> and vice-president of Cheider. Chabad serves approximately 2,500 Jews in the Holland region, and an unknown number in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\n===Reform Judaism===\nThough the number of Dutch Jews is decreasing,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} the last decades have seen a growth of Liberal Jewish communities throughout the country. Introduced by German-Jewish refugees in the early 1930s, nowadays some 3,500 Jews in the Netherlands are linked to one of several Liberal Jewish synagogues throughout the country. Liberal synagogues are present in Amsterdam (founded in 1931; 725 families \u2013 some 1,700 members), Rotterdam (1968), The Hague (1959; 324 families), Tilburg (1981), Utrecht (1993), Arnhem (1965; 70 families), Haaksbergen (1972), Almere (2003), Heerenveen (2000; some 30 members) and Zuid-Laren. The ''[[Verbond voor Liberaal-Religieuze Joden in Nederland]]'' (LJG) (Union for Liberal-Religious Jews in the Netherlands) (to which all the communities mentioned above are part of) is affiliated to the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]]. On 29 October 2006, the LJG changed its name to ''Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom'' (NVPJ) (Dutch Union for Progressive Judaism). The NVPJ has ten rabbis; some of them are: Menno ten Brink, David Lilienthal, Awraham Soetendorp, Edward van Voolen, Marianne van Praag, Navah-Tehillah Livingstone, Albert Ringer, Tamara Benima.\n\nA new Liberal synagogue has been built (2010) in Amsterdam, 300 meters away from the current synagogue. This was needed since the former building became too small for the growing community. The Liberal synagogue in Amsterdam receives approximately 30 calls a month by people who wish to convert to Judaism. The number of people who complete conversion is much lower. The number of converts to Liberal Judaism may be as high as 200 to 400, in an existing community of approximately 3,500.\n\nAmsterdam is home to ''[[Beit Ha'Chidush]]'', a progressive religious community that was founded in 1995 by Jews with secular as well as religious backgrounds. They wanted to create a more open, diverse, and renewed Judaism. The community accepts members from all backgrounds, including homosexuals and half-Jews (including Jews with a Jewish father, the first Jewish community in the Netherlands to do so). Beit Ha'Chidush has links to [[Jewish Renewal]] in the United States, and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] in the United Kingdom. The rabbi for the community was German-born [[Elisa Klapheck]], the first female rabbi of the Netherlands. It is now Clary Rooda. The community uses the {{Interlanguage link multi|Uilenburger Synagoge|nl}} in the center of Amsterdam.\n\n===Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[File:KoornmarktSynagogeDelft.jpg|thumb|Koornmarkt synagogue, Delft, The Netherlands]]The Open Jewish Congregation [[OJG Klal Isra\u00ebl]] in [[Delft]] was founded at the end of 2005, to establish an accepting home for all Jews.  The first service was held on January 6, 2005 in the historic Koornmarkt synagogue of [[Delft]]. Services have continued every two weeks, alternating on Friday evening or Saturday morning, next to holidays. Klal Isra\u00ebl has been affiliated with the Jewish [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Communities]] since November 2009. Participation in the activities is open to anyone who feels Jewish, is Jewish, or wants to be Jewish. Klal Isra\u00ebl is a progressive egalitarian community, where women and men enjoy equal rights.

In 2005 ''Masorti Nederland'' (Masorti Netherlands) had some 75 families, primarily based in the greater Amsterdam-Almere region.  The congregation uses the 19th century synagogue in the city of [[Weesp]]. Its first rabbi is [[David Soetendorp]] (1945).\n\nThere is also a second Dutch Masorti kehilla in the city of [[Deventer]] called Masorti Jewish Community [[:nl:Beth Shoshanna]] that began in 2010 and holds services and other activities in the 19th century [[Great Synagogue of Deventer]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Jewish Renewal===\n[[Jewish Renewal]] was first introduced in the Netherlands in the [[1990s]] by Carola de Vries Robles.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''HaMakor - Center for Jewish Spirituality'' is the current home for Jewish Renewal and is led by Rabbi [[Hannah Nathans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamakor.nl/en/nl-rabbijn-hannah-nathans/|website=www.hamakor.nl|title=About Rabbi Hannah Nathans|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> They don't have membership dues and therefore most activities require money paid to participate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamakor.nl/en/toegankelijk-voor-ieder-inkomen/|website=www.hamakor.nl|title=Access for All|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Education and youth==\n\n===Jewish schools===\nThere are three Jewish schools in the Netherlands, all in Amsterdam and affiliated with the [[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]] (NIK).

By far the most prominent is [[Joods.nl]], which gives attention to the large Jewish communities in the Netherlands as well as to the [[Mediene]], to Israel as well as to Jewish culture and youth.\n\n==Amsterdam==\nAmsterdam's Jewish community today numbers about 15,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A large number live in the neighbourhoods of [[Buitenveldert]], the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]] and the River Neighbourhood. Buitenveldert is considered a popular neighbourhood to live in; this is due to its low crime-rate and because it is considered to be a quiet neighbourhood.\n\nEspecially in the neighbourhood of Buitenveldert there's a sizeable Jewish community. In this area, Kosher food is widely available. There are several Kosher restaurants, two bakeries, Jewish-Israeli shops, a pizzeria and some supermarkets host a Kosher department. This neighourbood also has a Jewish elderly home, an Orthodox synagogue and three Jewish schools.\n\n==Cultural distinctions==\nUniquely in the Netherlands, Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities coexisted in close proximity. Having different cultural traditions, the communities remained generally separate, but their geographical closeness resulted in cross-cultural influences not found elsewhere. Notably, in the early days when small groups of Jews were attempting to establish communities, they used the services of [[rabbi]]s and other officials from either culture, depending on who was available.\n\nThe close proximity of the two cultures also led to intermarriage at a higher rate than was known elsewhere, and in consequence many Jews of Dutch descent have family names that seem to belie their religious affiliation. All Dutch Jews have for centuries named children after the children's grandparents{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, which is otherwise considered exclusively a Sephardi tradition. (Ashkenazim elsewhere traditionally avoid naming a child after a living relative.)\n\nIn 1812, while the Netherlands was under [[Napoleonic]] rule, all Dutch residents (including Jews) were obliged to register surnames with the civic authorities; previously only Sephardim had complied with this. Although the Ashkenazim had avoided civic registration, many had been using an unofficial system of surnames for hundreds of years.\n\nAlso under Napoleonic rule, an 1809 law required Dutch Jewish schools to teach in Dutch as well as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This excluded other languages. [[Yiddish]], the [[lingua franca]] of Ashkenazim, and [[Judaeo-Portuguese]], the previous language of the Portuguese Sephardim, practically ceased to be spoken among Dutch Jews. Certain Yiddish words have been adopted into the Dutch language, especially in Amsterdam, where there was a large Jewish population. (The city is also called ''Mokum'', from the Hebrew word for town or place, ''makom''.)\n\nSeveral other [[Hebrew]] words can be found in the local dialect, including: ''Mazzel'' from ''mazel'', which is the Hebrew word for luck or fortune; ''Tof'' which is ''Tov'', in Hebrew meaning good (as in \u05de\u05d6\u05dc \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u2013 [[Mazel tov]]); and ''Goochem'', in Hebrew ''Chacham'' or [[Hakham]], meaning wise, sly, witty or intelligent, where the Dutch ''g'' is pronounced similarly to the 8th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet the guttural ''Chet'' or [[Heth]].\n\n==Economic influences==\n[[File:Amsterdam - Hirsch&Co Leidseplein.jpg|thumb|Hirsch & Co. fashion house, Amsterdam]]\nJews played a major role in the development of Dutch colonial territories and international trade, and many Jews in former colonies have Dutch ancestry. However, all the major colonial powers were competing fiercely for control of trade routes; the Dutch were relatively unsuccessful and during the 18th century, their economy went into decline. \n\nMany of the Ashkenazim in the rural areas were no longer able to subsist and they migrated to the cities in search of work. This caused a large number of small Jewish communities to collapse completely (ten adult males were required in order to conduct major religious ceremonies). Entire communities migrated to the cities, where Jewish populations swelled dramatically. In 1700, the Jewish population of Amsterdam was 6,200, with Ashkenazim and Sephardim in almost equal numbers. By 1795 the figure was 20,335, the vast majority being poor Ashkenazim from rural areas.\n\nBecause Jews were obliged to live in specified Jewish quarters, there was severe overcrowding. By the mid-nineteenth century, many were emigrating to other countries where the advancement of [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] offered better opportunities (see [[Chuts]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Beit Ha'Chidush]]\n* [[Jewish Amsterdam]]\n* [[Jewish Eindhoven]]\n* [[Jewish Maastricht]]\n* [[Jewish Tilburg]]\n* [[List of Dutch Jews]]\n* [[List of Jews deported from Wageningen (1942-1943)]]\n* [[Mediene]]\n* [[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]\n* [[Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom]]\n* [[Nieuw Isra\u00eblitisch Weekblad]]\n* [[Pallache family]]\n* [[Portugees-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]\n* [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitische Gemeente Den Haag]]\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Arbell, Mordechai.

It has continued to the present. Following the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany in May 1940, the Jewish community was severely persecuted. About 70% of its members were killed by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Holocaust]] during World War II.\n\nThe area now known as the [[Netherlands]] was once part of the [[Spanish Empire]] but in 1581, the [[Dutch Republic|northern Dutch provinces]] declared independence. A principal motive was the wish to practice [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christianity, then [[Spanish Inquisition|forbidden under Spanish rule]]. Religious tolerance was effectively an important constitutional element of the newly independent state. This inevitably attracted the attention of Jews who were religiously oppressed in different parts of the world.  In pursuit of religious freedoms, many Jews migrated to the Netherlands where they flourished.  \n\nDuring the German Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, 70 percent of the Jewish population of the Netherlands was killed during the Holocaust, which included deportation to concentration and extermination camps.\n\n==History of Jews in the Netherlands==\n\n===Early history===\n\nIt was likely that the earliest Jews arrived in the \"Low Countries\", present-day Belgium and the Netherlands, during the Roman conquest early in the common era. Little is known about these early settlers, other than they were not very numerous. For some time, the Jewish presence consisted of, at most, small isolated communities and scattered families. Reliable documentary evidence dates only from the 1100s; for several centuries, the record reflects that the Jews were persecuted within the region and expelled on a regular basis. Early sources from the 11th and 12th centuries mention official debates or disputations between Christians and Jews, in which attempts were made to convince the Jews of the truth of Christianity and to try to convert them. They were documented in the other provinces at an earlier date, especially after their expulsion from [[History of the Jews in France|France]] in 1321 and the persecutions in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and the Rhine provinces. The first Jews in the province of [[Gelderland]] were reported in 1325. Jews have been settled in [[Nijmegen]], the oldest settlement, in [[Doesburg]], [[Zutphen]], and in [[Arnhem]] since 1404. As of the 13th century, there are sources that indicate that Jews were living in Brabant and Limburg, mainly in cities such as Brussels, Leuven, Tienen, and Maastricht. Sources from the 14th century also mention Jewish residents in the cities of Antwerp and Mechelen and in the northern region of Geldern.\n\nBetween 1347 and 1351, Europe was hit by the plague or [[Black Death]]. This resulted in a new theme in medieval anti-Semitic rhetoric. The Jews were held responsible for the epidemic and for the way it was rapidly spreading, because presumably they were the ones who had poisoned the water of springs used by the Christians. Various medieval chronicles mention this, e.g., those of Radalphus de Rivo (c. 1403) of Tongeren, who wrote that Jews were murdered in the Brabant region and in the city of Zwolle because they were accused of spreading the Black Death. This accusation was added to other traditional [[blood libels]] against the Jews. They were accused of piercing the Host used for communion and killing Christian children to use as a blood offering during [[Passover]]. Local Jewish communities were often murdered in part or entirely, or exiled in hysterical pogroms. In May 1370, six Jews were burned at the stake in Brussels because they were accused of theft and of desecrating the Holy Sacrament.\nIn addition, documentation can be found of instances in which Jews were abused and insulted, e.g., in the cities of Zutphen, Deventer, and Utrecht, for allegedly desecrating the Host. Rioters massacred the majority of the Jews in the region and expelled those who survived. \n\nIn 1349 the Duke of [[Guelders]] was authorized by the [[Emperor Louis IV]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire of Germany]] to receive Jews in his duchy, where they provided services, paid a tax, and were protected by the law. In Arnhem, where a Jewish physician is mentioned, the magistrate defended him against the hostilities of the populace. When Jews settled in the diocese of Utrecht is unknown, but rabbinical records regarding [[kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]] speculated that the Jewish community there dated to Roman times. In 1444, Jews were expelled from the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Until 1789 Jews were prohibited from staying in the city overnight. They were tolerated in the village of [[Maarssen]], two hours distant, though their condition was not fortuitous. But, the community of Maarssen was one of the most important Jewish settlements in the Netherlands. Jews were admitted to Zeeland by Albert, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nIn 1477, by the marriage of [[Mary of Burgundy]] to the Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], the Netherlands were united to Austria, and its possessions passed to the crown of Spain. In the sixteenth century, owing to the persecutions of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Philip II of Spain]], the Netherlands became involved in a series of desperate and heroic struggles against this growing political and Catholic religious hegemony. In 1522, Charles V issued a proclamation in Gelderland and Utrecht against Christians who were suspected of being lax [[Roman Catholic Church|in the faith]], as well as against Jews who had not been baptized. He repeated such edicts in 1545 and 1549, trying to suppress the [[Protestant Reformation]], which was expanding. In 1571 the Duke of Alba notified the authorities of Arnhem that all Jews living there should be seized and held until their fates were determined. \n\nAt Dutch request, [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Mattias]] established religious peace in most of the provinces, which was later guaranteed by article 13 of the 1579 ''[[Union of Utrecht|Unie van Utrecht]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/cons/dutch/Union_Utrecht_1579.html|title=Union of Utrecht 1579}}</ref> Moreover, in 1581, the deputies of the United Provinces declared independence by issuing the [[Act of Abjuration]], which deposed Philip as their sovereign. As a consequence of these two events, Jews persecuted in Spain and Portugal turned toward the Dutch Republic as a place of refuge.\n\n===Sephardim===\n\n''Sephardim'' or [[Sephardic Jews]] (sometimes referred to as ''[[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]]'') were native to ''Sepharad'', the Hebrew name for [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. They had been expelled or were forced to convert to Catholicism in the late 15th century through the Spanish [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492, and later the [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|Portuguese Edicts]] of 1496 and 1497. Many still remained in the [[Iberian peninsula]], practicing either their [[New Christians|new religion]] in public and Judaism in secret, or both (see [[anusim]], [[crypto-Jews]], or [[Marranos]]). The newly independent and tolerant Dutch provinces provided more favourable conditions for observant Jews to establish a community, and to practice their religion openly. The Rabbi of the Portuguese-Spanish Synagogue in Amsterdam, still in use today, was Abraham Cohen Pimentel (died March 21, 1697). The services are still held in the Portuguese language. The Portuguese Jews migrated most notably to the city of [[Amsterdam]]. As they became established, they collectively brought new trading expertise and connections to the city. They also brought navigation knowledge and techniques from Portugal, which enabled the Netherlands to start competing in overseas trade with the Spanish and Portuguese colonies.\n\nAfter having been refused admission to [[Middelburg]] and [[Haarlem]], these [[Anusim]] arrived in Amsterdam in 1593. Among them were skilled artisans, physicians and prominent merchants such as [[Jacob Tirado]], who obtained permission from the authorities to practice Judaism within his household. Those \"Jews of the Portuguese Nation\" worked in common cause with the people of Amsterdam and contributed materially to the prosperity of the country; they were strong supporters of the [[House of Orange]] and were protected by the Stadholder. During the [[Twelve Years' Truce]], the commerce of the Dutch Republic increased considerably, and a period of strong development ensued. This was particularly true for Amsterdam, where the Marranos had established their main port and base of operations. They maintained foreign trade relationships in the Mediterranean, including Venice, the Levant and Morocco. The Emperor of Morocco had an ambassador at [[The Hague]] named [[Samuel Pallache]], through whose mediation, in 1620, a commercial understanding was reached with the [[Barbary States]].\n\nThe Sephardic Jews of Amsterdam also established trade relationships with other countries in Europe. In the early 1620s numerous Jews migrated from Holland to the Lower Elbe region.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''European Jewry in the Age of Mercantilism 1550\u20131750'', p.92</ref> In a letter dated 25 November 1622, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] invited Jews of Amsterdam to settle in [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]], where, among other privileges, they were assured the free exercise of their religion.\n\nThe trade developed between the Dutch and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish South America]] was established by such Iberian Jews. They also contributed to establishing the [[Dutch West Indies Company]] in 1621, and some of them sat on its directorate. The ambitious schemes of the Dutch for the conquest of Brazil were carried into effect by Francisco Ribeiro, a Portuguese captain, who is said to have had Jewish relations in Holland. The Sephardic Jews of Amsterdam strongly supported the Dutch Republic in its struggle with Portugal for the possession of Brazil, which started in Recife with the arrival of Count Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen in 1637. Some years later, the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch in Brazil]] appealed for more craftsmen of all kinds, and many Jews heeded the call. In 1642 about 600 Jews left Amsterdam for Brazil, accompanied by two distinguished scholars, [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]] and [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]]. After the loss of the Dutch colony of Recife to the Portuguese in 1654, they sought refuge in other Dutch colonies, including the island of [[Cura\u00e7ao]] in the Caribbean and [[New Amsterdam]] (Manhattan) in North America.\n\n[[File:SPAmster.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Interior of the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]], the synagogue for the Portuguese-Israelite ([[Sephardic]]) community. It was inaugurated 2 August 1675, and is still in use by the Jewish community.]]\nBesides merchants, many physicians were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam. These included Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family. Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice in April, 1623. Jews were admitted as students to the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science that was of practical use to them. They were not allowed to practice law, because lawyers were required to take a Christian oath, thereby excluding them. Jews were also excluded from the trade guilds, as in a 1632 resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam (the Dutch cities were largely autonomous). However, they were allowed to practice certain trades: printing, bookselling, and selling meat, poultry, groceries, and medicines. In 1655 a Sephardic Jew was exceptionally permitted to establish a sugar refinery using chemical methods. \n\nSeveral Sephardic Jews stood out during that time, including [[Menasseh Ben Israel]]. He was known for corresponding widely with Christian leaders and helped to promote [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|Jewish resettlement in England]]. Perhaps the most famous among Dutch Jews of Sephardic origin is [[Benedictus de Spinoza]] (Baruch Spinoza), a philosopher, scholar and optician who was excommunicated from the Jewish community in 1656 after speaking out his ideas concerning (the nature of) God, later published in his famous work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics Demonstrated in Geometrical Order]]'' (1677).\n\n===Ashkenazim===\n\nMany [[Ashkenazi Jews|German Jews]] were also attracted later to the tolerant and independent Dutch provinces, generally after the mid-17th century. Unlike the more acculturated Iberian Jews, most of these were displaced residents of [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos]] escaping persecution. In addition they were displaced by the violence of the [[Thirty Year War]] (1618\u20131648) in other parts of northern Europe, and local expulsions, as well as the 1648 [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in Poland. These poor immigrants were less welcomed. Their arrival in considerable number threatened the economic status of Amsterdam in particular, and with few exceptions they were turned away. They generally settled in rural areas, where they subsisted typically as [[peddler]]s and [[Hawker (trade)|hawker]]s. Many [[Mediene|smaller Jewish communities]] were started throughout the Dutch provinces.\n\nOver time, many German Jews gained prosperity through retail trading and they became specialists in diamond-cutting and sales. They had a monopoly in the latter trade until about 1870. When [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]] was proclaimed stadholder (1747), the Jews found another protector. He had close relations with the head of the DePinto family, at whose villa, Tulpenburg, near [[Ouderkerk]], he and his wife paid more than one visit. In 1748, when a French army was at the frontier and the treasury was empty, De Pinto collected a large sum and presented it to the state. Van Hogendorp, the secretary of state, wrote to him: \"You have saved the state.\" In 1750 De Pinto arranged for the conversion of the national debt from a 4 to a 3% basis.\n\nUnder the government of [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], the country was troubled by internal dissensions. But the Jews remained loyal to him. As he entered the legislature on the day of his majority, 8 March 1766, in the synagogues services of thanks-giving were held. William V visited both the German and the Portuguese synagogues on 3 June 1768. He also attended the marriages of offspring of various prominent Jewish families.\n\n===French Revolution and Napoleon===\n\nThe year 1795 brought the results of the French Revolution to the Netherlands, including emancipation for the Jews. The National Convention, on 2 September 1796, proclaimed this resolution: \"No Jew shall be excluded from rights or advantages which are associated with citizenship in the Batavian Republic, and which he may desire to enjoy.\" Moses Moresco was appointed member of the municipality at Amsterdam; Moses Asser member of the court of justice there. The old conservatives, at whose head stood the chief rabbi Jacob Moses L\u00f6wenstamm, were not desirous of emancipation rights. Indeed, these rights were for the greater part of doubtful advantage; their culture was not so far advanced that they could frequent ordinary society; besides, this emancipation was offered to them by a party which had expelled their beloved [[Prince of Orange]], to whose house they remained so faithful that the chief rabbi at The Hague, Saruco, was called the \"Orange dominie\"; the men of the old r\u00e9gime were even called \"Orange cattle\". Nevertheless, the Revolution appreciably ameliorated the condition of the Jews; in 1799 their congregations received, like the Christian congregations, grants from the treasury. In 1798 [[Jonas Daniel Meijer]] interceded with the French minister of foreign affairs in behalf of the [[Jews of Germany]]; and on 22 Aug. 1802, the Dutch ambassador, [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck|Schimmelpenninck]], delivered a note on the same subject to the French minister.\n\nFrom 1806 to 1810 the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was ruled by [[Louis Bonaparte]], whose intention it was to so amend the condition of the Jews that their newly acquired rights would become of real value to them; the shortness of his reign, however, prevented him from carrying out his plans. For example, after having changed the market-day in some cities (Utrecht and [[Rotterdam]]) from Saturday to Monday, he abolished the use of the \"[[Oath More Judaico]]\" in the courts of justice, and administered the same formula to both Christians and Jews.

The Netherlands was not under a military regime. It was the most densely inhabited country of Western Europe, making it difficult for the relatively large number of Jews to go into hiding. Most Jews in Amsterdam were poor, which limited their options for flight or hiding. The country did not have much open space or woods for people to flee to. Also, the civil administration had detailed records that indicated the numbers of Jews, and where they lived. The average citizen of the Netherlands was unaware of the operation of \"death camps\", such as Mauthausen for the majority of the occupation. All Dutch citizens were obligated to \"register\" and undertake work in Germany.<ref>Ettie Huizing, ''Wie het geweten heeft, het levensverhaal van Siep Adema,'' SUN 1994, {{ISBN|90-6168-425-0}}</ref>  When the Dutch recognised German persecution of the Jews in the Netherlands, they conducted the first act of mass civil disobedience in occupied Europe during WWII: the ''Februaristaking'' (\u201c[[February strike]]\u201d), in order to show their support for Jewish citizens.\n\nOne theory is that the Germans made use of the administrative organizations and Dutch police: \n<blockquote>\"In their preparations for the extermination of the Jews living in The Netherlands, the Germans could count on the assistance of the greater part of the Dutch administrative infrastructure. The occupiers had to employ only a relatively limited number of their own personnel; Dutch policemen rounded up the families to be sent to their deaths in Eastern Europe. Trains of the Dutch railways staffed by Dutch employees transported the Jews to camps in the Netherlands which were transit points to Auschwitz, Sobibor, and other death camps.\" With respect to Dutch collaboration, [[Eichmann]] is quoted as saying \"The transports run so smoothly that it is a pleasure to see.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp412.htm |title=Wartime and Postwar Dutch Attitudes Toward the Jews: Myth and Truth |author=Manfred Gerstenfeld |publisher=Jcpa.org |date=1999-08-15 |accessdate=2012-05-01|author-link=Manfred Gerstenfeld }}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Amsterdam Anne Frank.jpg|thumb|left|220px|This [[statue]] in Amsterdam commemorates [[Anne Frank]], a Jewish girl who went into hiding with her family during the Second World War. They were found and transported. Her father survived and later published her diary. (She is presumably represented by a stone at Westerbork.)]]\n\nDuring the first year of the occupation of the Netherlands, Jews, who were already registered on basis of their faith with the authorities (just as Protestants, Catholics and others were), had to get a large \"J\" stamped in their IDs. Every Dutch resident had to declare whether or not they had \"Jewish\" roots. The Germans banned Jews from certain occupations and isolated them from public life. Starting in January 1942, some Dutch Jews were forced to move to Amsterdam; others were directly deported to [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]], a transit and concentration camp near the small village of [[Hooghalen]]. Westerbork was founded in 1939 by the Dutch government as the Central Refugee Camp to give shelter to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution following ''[[Kristallnacht]]''. After the German occupation of the Netherlands in 1940, it became a transit camp for Jews who were being deported to the [[Nazi concentration camps]] in Middle and Eastern Europe, and later to extermination camps. Nearly all the prisoners who left Westerbork for the east died in the Holocaust before the end of World War II.\n\nAll non-Dutch Jews were also sent to Westerbork. In addition, over 15,000 Jews were sent to labour camps. Deportations of Jews from the Netherlands to [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|German-occupied Poland]] and Germany began on 15 June 1942 and ended on 13 September 1944. Ultimately some 101,000 Jews were deported in 98 transports from Westerbork to [[Auschwitz]] (57,800; 65 transports), [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] (34,313; 19 transports), [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] (3,724; 8 transports) and [[Theresienstadt]] (4,466; 6 transports), where most of them were murdered. Another 6,000 Jews were deported from other locations (like [[Vught]]) in the Netherlands to concentration camps in Germany, Poland and Austria (like [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]). Only 5,200 survived. The Dutch underground hid an estimated number of Jews of some 25,000\u201330,000; eventually, an estimated 16,500 Jews managed to survive the war by hiding. Some 7,000 to 8,000 survived by fleeing to countries like Spain, the United Kingdom, and [[Switzerland]], or by being married to non-Jews (which saved them from deportation and possible death). At the same time, there was substantial collaboration with the Nazis from members of the Dutch population, including the Amsterdam city administration, the Dutch municipal police, and Dutch railway workers, who all helped to round up and deport Jews.\n\nOne of the best known Holocaust victims in the Netherlands is [[Anne Frank]]. Along with her sister, [[Margot Frank]], she died from [[typhus]] in March 1945 in the [[concentration camp]] of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Disease was widespread because of unsanitary living conditions and confinement by the Nazis. Anne Frank's mother, [[Edith Frank-Holl\u00e4nder]], was starved to death by the Nazis in [[Auschwitz]]. Her father, [[Otto Frank]], survived the war. Other noted Dutch victims of the Holocaust include [[Etty Hillesum]], whose writings were later published;<ref>Frank, Evelyne.

From July 15, 1942 to February 23rd, 1943 an estimated 42,915 Jews were deported from [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Only 85 survived. From August 20 to December 8, 1942, 3,540 Jews were taken to different forced labor camps. Of these, there were 181 survivors. 34, 313 Jews were deported to Sobibor from March 2 to July 20, 1943. A mere 19 survived. From August 24, 1943 to September 3rd, 1944, 11,985 Jews were deported from Westerbork to Auschwitz. Of this deportation, 588 lived. From November 15<sup>th,</sup> 1943, to June 3rd, 1944, 1,645 Jews were sent from Vught to Auschwitz. There were 198 survivors. From 1943-1944, 4,870 Jews were sent from Amsterdam and Westerbork to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]]. Of the almost 5,000 Jews sent to Theresiendadt, 1,950 survived. In October 1943, 150 Jews were sent from Westerbork to Buchenwold and [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]]. In 1944, 3,751 Jews were deported from Westerbork to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen Belsen]]. This transport had the highest rate of survival, with 2,050 Jews surviving.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n107,000 Jews were deported from the Netherlands and German prisons to concentration camps, then Auschwitz. Of these 107,000, only 5,200 survived. There were 102,000 Jews that fell victim to the Nazi\u2019s. Some were Native Dutch, and others were refugees who attempted to seek asylum in the Netherlands.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Etty Hillesum ====\nOne of these victims was Esther or [[Etty Hillesum]]. Hillesum began to keep a diary when she was 27 years old. Her diary chronicles her dreams of becoming a writer, her spiritual and sexual growth, and her realization of the grim fate the Jews faced. Along with her diary, Etty also wrote letters from Westerbork camp. Partially published in Dutch resistance newspapers while she was alive, her letters were later published posthumously. These letters detail the conditions at Westerbork, and the transport of Jews to extermination camps. On July 10, 1943, Hillesum wrote a letter from Westerbork that discussed what she recognised as her parents' inevitable transport to an eastern camp and their likely deaths.<ref>Hillesum, Etty. ''ETTY A Diary 1941-43''. Translated by Arnold J. Pomerans. Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk: St Edmundsbury Press, 1983. p. 200.</ref> Her writings were later posthumously published in English as ''[[An Interrupted Life]]'' (1992).\nShe wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201cTen thousand have passed through this place, the clothed and the naked, the old and the young, the sick and the healthy \u2013 and I am left to live and work and stay cheerful. It will be my parents\u2019 turn to leave soon, if by some miracle not this week then certainly one of the next. And I must learn to accept this as well.\u201d</blockquote>Etty\u2019s fate was the same as that of her parents, and the more than 100,000 other Jews who were deported from the Netherlands to transit camps and then extermination camps, where most died. Hillesum died at Auschwitz on or around November 30, 1943. Jopie, a friend from Westerbork, wrote to Hillesum's friends about Etty\u2019s mood at deportation. Jopie wrote that Etty was buoyant, humorous, and kind, \u201cevery inch\u201d the Etty that they knew so well.<ref>Bernard, Weinstein. \u201cEtty Hillesum's ''An Interrupted Life: Searching for the Human'', in ''The Netherlands and Nazi genocide: papers of the 21st Annual Scholars Conference,'' edited by G.

She organised the first train transport of 600 Jewish children from [[Vienna]] in December 1938, after direct negotiations with [[Adolf Eichmann]] in the city, and the ultimate children's transport [[Kindertransport]], on 14 May 1940, from the Netherlands with 74 children on board the last ship leaving the country, the SS Bodegraven. Per 2014 her role in the Kindertransporte is slowly gaining recognition in English-speaking countries. A new fictionalized book on her life, 'The Last Train to London' (2019) by [[Meg Waite Clayton]], was being translated into 22 languages, including Dutch. Mrs Wijsmuller was one of the founders of the [[Anne Frank Foundation]] in Amsterdam, serving under Otto Frank as president. A bust in Bach Square in Amsterdam honours her memory.\n\n===1945\u20131960===\nThe Jewish-Dutch population after the Second World War is marked by certain significant changes: disappointment; emigration; a low birth rate; and a high intermarriage rate. After the Second World War and the Holocaust, returning Jews and Jews who had survived the often difficult hidden living ('diving') met with total lack of understanding of their fate and had to endure lasting loss of property. Especially mental health care was lacking and only started to develop from 1960 onwards in the Sinai centrum in Amersfoort. From 1973 professor Bastiaans tried to treat Holocaust victims with [[LSD]] in the Centrum '45 in Oegstgeest, attached to the Leyden University. This brought little succes, if any.  Understanding started to grow by a series of four tv documentaries on the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands made by the Jewish historian dr Lou de Jong, broadcast on Dutch national public tv (NTS, then the sole tv channel). The first four installments aired in 1960, were considered a turning point and left many Dutch, who until then had hardly had any notion of the gruesome depth of the Holocaust, aghast. The series continued through 1964. Dr De Jong subsequently published a 14 part, 29 volume history of the Netherlands during WW-II. \n\nIn 1965 the Jewish professor of history  [[Jaques Presser]] published his magister opus 'Ondergang' ('Demise - the Persecution and Eradication of Dutch Jewry'). The work was reprinted six times during its first year, reaching the relatively incredible print run of 150,000 - still today a record in the history of publishing in the Netherlands.\n\nNevertheless, as a result of the lack of understanding, mental and physical health problems, too many missing relatives and general administrational difficulties, thousands of surviving Jews emigrated, or made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]], later [[Israel]]. Aliyah from the Netherlands initially surpassed that of any other Western nation. Israel is still home to some 6,000 Dutch Jews. Others emigrated to the [[United States]]. There was a high assimilation and intermarriage rate among those who stayed. As a result, the Jewish birth rate and organized community membership dropped. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the sharp increase of understanding for the shoah, relations with non-Jews were gradually friendly. The Jewish community received reparations payments from the Dutch government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/netherlands.html |title=Netherlands: Virtual Jewish History Tour |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref>. Also reparations from Germany (aka 'Wiedergutmachung') started to trickle down into Dutch Jewish households.\n\nIn 1947, two years after the end of the Second World War in the Netherlands, the total number of Jews as counted in the population census was just 14,346 (less than 10 percent of the count of 154,887 by the Nazi occupation force in 1941). Later, this number was adjusted by Jewish organisations to some 24,000 Jews living in the Netherlands in 1954. This was a huge loss compared to the number of Jews counted in 1941. This latter number was disputed, as the Nazi occupation force counted Jews on their classification of race. They included hundreds of Christians of Jewish heritage in the Nazi census. (According to Raul Hilberg ,in his book, ''Perpetrators Victims Bystanders: the Jewish Catastrophe, 1933\u20131945'', \"the Netherlands ... [had] 1,572 Protestants [of Jewish heritage in 1943] ... There were also some 700 Catholic Jews living in the Netherlands [during the Nazi occupation] ...\")\n\nIn 1954, the Dutch Jews were recorded in the Netherlands as follows (province; number of Jews):\n* [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] \u2013 242\n* [[Friesland]] \u2013 155\n* [[Drenthe]] \u2013 180\n* [[Overijssel]] \u2013 945\n* [[Gelderland]] \u2013 997\n* [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] \u2013 848\n* [[North Holland]] \u2013 15,446 (including 14,068 in [[Amsterdam]])\n* [[South Holland]] \u2013 3,934\n* [[Zeeland]] \u2013 59\n* [[North Brabant]] \u2013 620\n* [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] \u2013 297\n* Total \u2013 23,723\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nBecause of the loss of 79% of the population, including many children and young people, the birth rate among Jews declined in the 1960s and 1970s. Intermarriage increased; the intermarriage rate of Jewish males was 41% and of Jewish women 28% in the period of 1945\u20131949. By the 1990s, the percentage of intermarriage increased to some 52% of all Jewish marriages.

Smaller, independent synagogues exist as\nwell.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Orthodox Judaism===\nMost affiliated Jews in the Netherlands (Jews part of a Jewish community) are affiliated to the ''[[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]'' (Dutch Israelite Church) (NIK), which can be classified as part of (Ashkenazi) [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The NIK has approximately 5,000 members, spread over 36 congregations (of whom 13 are in Amsterdam and surroundings) in four jurisdictions (Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and the Interprovincial Rabbinate). It is larger than the Union of Liberal Synagogues (LJG) and thirteen times as large as the Portuguese Israelite Religious Community (PIK). The NIK was founded in 1814. At its height in 1877, it represented 176 Jewish communities. By World War II, it had  139 communities; it is made up of 36 congregations today. Besides governing some 36 congregations, the NIK has responsibility for the operation of more than 200 Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands (the total is 250).\n\nIn 1965 Rabbi [[Meir Just]] was appointed Chief Rabbi of the Netherlands, a position he held until his death in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-chief-rabbi-meir-just-dies-aged-101 |title=Dutch Chief Rabbi Meir Just dies aged 101 &#124; Radio Netherlands Worldwide |publisher=Rnw.nl |date=2010-04-09 |accessdate=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323155626/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-chief-rabbi-meir-just-dies-aged-101 |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe small ''[[Portugees-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]'' (Portuguese Israelite Religious Community) (PIK), which is Sephardic in practice, has a membership of some 270 families. It is concentrated in Amsterdam. It was founded in 1870, although Sephardic Jews had long been in the city. Throughout history, Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands, in contrast to their Ashkenazi co-religionists, have settled mostly in a few communities: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, [[Naarden]] and Middelburg. Only the congregation in Amsterdam survived the Holocaust with enough members to maintain its activities. \n\nThree Jewish schools are located in Amsterdam, all situated in the Buitenveldert neighbourhood (Rosh Pina, Maimonides and Cheider). Cheider is affiliated with [[Haredi]] Orthodox Judaism. Chabad has eleven rabbis, in Almere, Amersfoort, Amstelveen, Amsterdam, Haarlem, Maastricht, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. The head ''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'' in the Netherlands are rabbis I. Vorst and Binyomin Jacobs.

Chabad serves approximately 2,500 Jews in the Holland region, and an unknown number in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\n===Reform Judaism===\nThough the number of Dutch Jews is decreasing,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} the last decades have seen a growth of Liberal Jewish communities throughout the country. Introduced by German-Jewish refugees in the early 1930s, nowadays some 3,500 Jews in the Netherlands are linked to one of several Liberal Jewish synagogues throughout the country. Liberal synagogues are present in Amsterdam (founded in 1931; 725 families \u2013 some 1,700 members), Rotterdam (1968), The Hague (1959; 324 families), Tilburg (1981), Utrecht (1993), Arnhem (1965; 70 families), Haaksbergen (1972), Almere (2003), Heerenveen (2000; some 30 members) and Zuid-Laren. The ''[[Verbond voor Liberaal-Religieuze Joden in Nederland]]'' (LJG) (Union for Liberal-Religious Jews in the Netherlands) (to which all the communities mentioned above are part of) is affiliated to the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]]. On 29 October 2006, the LJG changed its name to ''Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom'' (NVPJ) (Dutch Union for Progressive Judaism). The NVPJ has ten rabbis; some of them are: Menno ten Brink, David Lilienthal, Awraham Soetendorp, Edward van Voolen, Marianne van Praag, Navah-Tehillah Livingstone, Albert Ringer, Tamara Benima.\n\nA new Liberal synagogue has been built (2010) in Amsterdam, 300 meters away from the current synagogue. This was needed since the former building became too small for the growing community. The Liberal synagogue in Amsterdam receives approximately 30 calls a month by people who wish to convert to Judaism. The number of people who complete conversion is much lower. The number of converts to Liberal Judaism may be as high as 200 to 400, in an existing community of approximately 3,500.\n\nAmsterdam is home to ''[[Beit Ha'Chidush]]'', a progressive religious community that was founded in 1995 by Jews with secular as well as religious backgrounds. They wanted to create a more open, diverse, and renewed Judaism. The community accepts members from all backgrounds, including homosexuals and half-Jews (including Jews with a Jewish father, the first Jewish community in the Netherlands to do so). Beit Ha'Chidush has links to [[Jewish Renewal]] in the United States, and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] in the United Kingdom. The rabbi for the community was German-born [[Elisa Klapheck]], the first female rabbi of the Netherlands. It is now Clary Rooda. The community uses the {{Interlanguage link multi|Uilenburger Synagoge|nl}} in the center of Amsterdam.\n\n===Reconstructionist Judaism===\n[[File:KoornmarktSynagogeDelft.jpg|thumb|Koornmarkt synagogue, Delft, The Netherlands]]The Open Jewish Congregation [[OJG Klal Isra\u00ebl]] in [[Delft]] was founded at the end of 2005, to establish an accepting home for all Jews.  The first service was held on January 6, 2005 in the historic Koornmarkt synagogue of [[Delft]]. Services have continued every two weeks, alternating on Friday evening or Saturday morning, next to holidays. Klal Isra\u00ebl has been affiliated with the Jewish [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist Communities]] since November 2009. Participation in the activities is open to anyone who feels Jewish, is Jewish, or wants to be Jewish. Klal Isra\u00ebl is a progressive egalitarian community, where women and men enjoy equal rights. The siddurim \u2013 prayer books \u2013 contain Hebrew text as well as a phonetic transcription and a translation in Dutch. Klal Isra\u00ebl offers a giur procedure. As of the beginning of the Jewish year 5777 (October 2, 2016), [[Hannah Nathans]] is rabbi of the kehilla (congregation, Hebr.).\n\n===Conservative Judaism===\n[[Conservative Judaism]] (\"Masorti\") was introduced in the Netherlands in 2000, with the founding of a community in the city of [[Almere]]. In 2005 ''Masorti Nederland'' (Masorti Netherlands) had some 75 families, primarily based in the greater Amsterdam-Almere region.  The congregation uses the 19th century synagogue in the city of [[Weesp]]. Its first rabbi is [[David Soetendorp]] (1945).\n\nThere is also a second Dutch Masorti kehilla in the city of [[Deventer]] called Masorti Jewish Community [[:nl:Beth Shoshanna]] that began in 2010 and holds services and other activities in the 19th century [[Great Synagogue of Deventer]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Jewish Renewal===\n[[Jewish Renewal]] was first introduced in the Netherlands in the [[1990s]] by Carola de Vries Robles.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''HaMakor - Center for Jewish Spirituality'' is the current home for Jewish Renewal and is led by Rabbi [[Hannah Nathans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamakor.nl/en/nl-rabbijn-hannah-nathans/|website=www.hamakor.nl|title=About Rabbi Hannah Nathans|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> They don't have membership dues and therefore most activities require money paid to participate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamakor.nl/en/toegankelijk-voor-ieder-inkomen/|website=www.hamakor.nl|title=Access for All|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Education and youth==\n\n===Jewish schools===\nThere are three Jewish schools in the Netherlands, all in Amsterdam and affiliated with the [[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]] (NIK).

By far the most prominent is [[Joods.nl]], which gives attention to the large Jewish communities in the Netherlands as well as to the [[Mediene]], to Israel as well as to Jewish culture and youth.\n\n==Amsterdam==\nAmsterdam's Jewish community today numbers about 15,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A large number live in the neighbourhoods of [[Buitenveldert]], the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]] and the River Neighbourhood. Buitenveldert is considered a popular neighbourhood to live in; this is due to its low crime-rate and because it is considered to be a quiet neighbourhood.\n\nEspecially in the neighbourhood of Buitenveldert there's a sizeable Jewish community. In this area, Kosher food is widely available. There are several Kosher restaurants, two bakeries, Jewish-Israeli shops, a pizzeria and some supermarkets host a Kosher department. This neighourbood also has a Jewish elderly home, an Orthodox synagogue and three Jewish schools.\n\n==Cultural distinctions==\nUniquely in the Netherlands, Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities coexisted in close proximity. Having different cultural traditions, the communities remained generally separate, but their geographical closeness resulted in cross-cultural influences not found elsewhere. Notably, in the early days when small groups of Jews were attempting to establish communities, they used the services of [[rabbi]]s and other officials from either culture, depending on who was available.\n\nThe close proximity of the two cultures also led to intermarriage at a higher rate than was known elsewhere, and in consequence many Jews of Dutch descent have family names that seem to belie their religious affiliation. All Dutch Jews have for centuries named children after the children\u2019s grandparents{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, which is otherwise considered exclusively a Sephardi tradition. (Ashkenazim elsewhere traditionally avoid naming a child after a living relative.)\n\nIn 1812, while the Netherlands was under [[Napoleonic]] rule, all Dutch residents (including Jews) were obliged to register surnames with the civic authorities; previously only Sephardim had complied with this. Although the Ashkenazim had avoided civic registration, many had been using an unofficial system of surnames for hundreds of years.\n\nAlso under Napoleonic rule, an 1809 law required Dutch Jewish schools to teach in Dutch as well as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This excluded other languages. [[Yiddish]], the [[lingua franca]] of Ashkenazim, and [[Judaeo-Portuguese]], the previous language of the Portuguese Sephardim, practically ceased to be spoken among Dutch Jews. Certain Yiddish words have been adopted into the Dutch language, especially in Amsterdam, where there was a large Jewish population. (The city is also called ''Mokum'', from the Hebrew word for town or place, ''makom''.)\n\nSeveral other [[Hebrew]] words can be found in the local dialect, including: ''Mazzel'' from ''mazel'', which is the Hebrew word for luck or fortune; ''Tof'' which is ''Tov'', in Hebrew meaning good (as in \u05de\u05d6\u05dc \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u2013 [[Mazel tov]]); and ''Goochem'', in Hebrew ''Chacham'' or [[Hakham]], meaning wise, sly, witty or intelligent, where the Dutch ''g'' is pronounced similarly to the 8th letter of the Hebrew Alphabet the guttural ''Chet'' or [[Heth]].\n\n==Economic influences==\n[[File:Amsterdam - Hirsch&Co Leidseplein.jpg|thumb|Hirsch & Co. fashion house, Amsterdam]]\nJews played a major role in the development of Dutch colonial territories and international trade, and many Jews in former colonies have Dutch ancestry. However, all the major colonial powers were competing fiercely for control of trade routes; the Dutch were relatively unsuccessful and during the 18th century, their economy went into decline. \n\nMany of the Ashkenazim in the rural areas were no longer able to subsist and they migrated to the cities in search of work. This caused a large number of small Jewish communities to collapse completely (ten adult males were required in order to conduct major religious ceremonies). Entire communities migrated to the cities, where Jewish populations swelled dramatically. In 1700, the Jewish population of Amsterdam was 6,200, with Ashkenazim and Sephardim in almost equal numbers. By 1795 the figure was 20,335, the vast majority being poor Ashkenazim from rural areas.\n\nBecause Jews were obliged to live in specified Jewish quarters, there was severe overcrowding. By the mid-nineteenth century, many were emigrating to other countries where the advancement of [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] offered better opportunities (see [[Chuts]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Beit Ha'Chidush]]\n* [[Jewish Amsterdam]]\n* [[Jewish Eindhoven]]\n* [[Jewish Maastricht]]\n* [[Jewish Tilburg]]\n* [[List of Dutch Jews]]\n* [[List of Jews deported from Wageningen (1942-1943)]]\n* [[Mediene]]\n* [[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]\n* [[Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom]]\n* [[Nieuw Isra\u00eblitisch Weekblad]]\n* [[Pallache family]]\n* [[Portugees-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]]\n* [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitische Gemeente Den Haag]]\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Arbell, Mordechai.
