It includes dates of [[declarations of independence]], [[geographical renaming|changes in country name]], changes of [[capital city]] or name, and significant [[Political history of the world|changes in territory]] such as the [[annexation]], [[cession]], or [[secession]] of land.\n\nThe types of changes listed here usually include (but are not limited to) the alteration of borders, the creation and fall of [[State (polity)|states]], changes of geographical names, as well as a few geographical changes caused by unusually destructive natural disasters. Through the knowledge of such dates and events, the approximate year and age of a [[world map]] could be calculated and estimated.\n\nNot all maps of the world created during a given age or period will be the same across the globe, as different [[cartography|mapmakers]]{{spnd}}or their employers{{spnd}}may have different views on the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the countries of the world or possess different levels of technological sophistication or geographical insight. {{citation needed span|Even maps created by the same mapmaker around the same time can differ significantly.|date=January 2019|reason=This statement needs not just a reference to two maps, but rather a WP:SECONDARY source that supports this assertion.}}\n\nThe timeline below presents its information in reverse chronological order, beginning in the modern era and working backwards.\n\nThis article uses the [[Common Era|Common Calendar System]], which was established as the new [[Gregorian calendar|Christian Calendar]] by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1582. The Common Calendar uses the designation [[Common Era]] (CE or AD for [[Anno Domini]]) for years starting 1 January 1&nbsp;CE, and [[Before Common Era]] (BCE or BC for [[Before Christ]]) for years before that date. The Common Calendar also follows the [[ordinal number]]s rather than the [[cardinal number]]s, so there was no \"[[year zero]]\" in this format; that is, the date 1 January 1&nbsp;CE immediately followed the date 31 December 1&nbsp;BCE. For the same reason, while the [[Year 2000 problem|2000s]] began on Saturday, 1 January 2000&nbsp;CE, the official [[3rd millennium|Third Millennium]] began on Monday, 1 January 2001&nbsp;CE.\n\n{{center|\n'''&nbsp;[[#21st century|2000s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1990s|1900s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1890s|1800s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#18th century|1700s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#17th century|1600s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#16th century|1500s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#15th century|1400s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#14th century|1300s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#13th century|1200s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#12th century|1100s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#11th century|1000s]]&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;[[#1990s|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;CE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#First Millennium&nbsp;BCE|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Second Millennium&nbsp;BCE|2nd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Third Millennium&nbsp;BCE|3rd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Fourth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|4th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Tenth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|10th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp;'''\n}}\n\n{{Expand list|date=November 2019}}\n\n===21st century===\n\n==== '''2020s''' ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%\" |Year|| style=\"width:8%\" |Date|| style=\"width:86%\" |Event\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2020\n| align=\"center\" |27&nbsp;March\n|[[North Macedonia]] [[North Macedonia\u2013NATO relations|becomes]] a member state of [[NATO]].\n|-\n|31 January\n|[[Brexit]]: The [[United Kingdom]] [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdraws]] from the [[European Union]].\n|}\n====2010s====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:6%\"|Year||style=\"width:8%\"|Date||style=\"width:86%\"|Event\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2019\n|align=center|20&nbsp;March||'''[[Kazakhstan]]''' changes the name of its capital from Astana to [[Nur-Sultan]] in honour of ex-President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] after the [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] is amended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/20/parlament-kazahstana-odobril-pereimenovanie-astany-v-nursultan|title=Parliament of Kazakhstan approves renaming of Astana to Nursultan|last=|first=|date=|website=meduza.io|language=Russian|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=center|12&nbsp;February||The [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] adopts the name '''[[Republic of North Macedonia]]''' as part of the [[Prespa agreement]], under which [[Greece]] will no longer veto the country's accession to [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb|title=Announcement of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia for entry into force of the Final Agreement, Constitutional Amendments and Constitutional Law for Implementation of Amendments |work=Government of the Republic of North Macedonia |date=12 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213025155/https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb |archive-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TestoridesPaphitis2019\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |title=Europe: Macedonian lawmakers set to vote to change country's name |work=The Washington Post |date=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113162131/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |archive-date=13 January 2019 |url-status=live |first=Konstantin |last=Testorides |author1-link=Konstantin Testorides |first2=Nicholas |last2=Paphitis |author2-link=Nicholas Paphitis |agency=Associated Press |quote=Macedonia late Friday {{bracket|11 January 2019}} fulfilled its part of a historic deal that will pave its way to NATO membership and normalize relations with neighboring Greece, after lawmakers approved constitutional changes to rename the country North Macedonia.&nbsp;... {{bracket|Under}} the full implementation of the agreement&nbsp;...

These range from basic part-time systems that require the driver to move a control lever to send power to four wheels, to permanent four-wheel systems that monitor and sense traction needs at all four wheels automatically under all conditions.\n\n==Command-Trac==\n\n===Command-Trac===\nCommand-Trac was first introduced using the NP208 transfer case in the full-size Jeeps (SJ series) in 1980.  The drive modes are the same as with the Dana 18 and 20 transfer cases: 2Hi, 4HI PT, and 4LO PT.  The 4WD modes are not for use on high-traction surfaces such as dry roads.  The NP208 was used through at least 1987.\n\nMore commonly, ''Command-Trac'' is used to refer to the NP/NV-231 or NP-207 transfer cases introduced along with the '''[[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]]''' (XJ) in 1984. The system offers a chain-driven, aluminum, \"shift-on-the-fly\" transfer case. The \"shift-on-the-fly\" feature provides manual ease and assist while engaging 4WD. ''Command-Trac'' should only be driven in 4WD on low-traction surfaces due to the front and rear axles being locked together (no differential action in the transfer case). Driving in 4WD on dry pavement causes excessive tire and drivetrain wear. Four-wheel modes are most commonly used for wet/slick surfaces or extreme weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.) (4H), towing (N), and off-road activities (4L).\n\nThere are reports of a modified version known as NP-231J HD which was supposedly (SP) a \"heavy duty\" version for the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee#First generation (ZJ; 1993\u20131998)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] with V8 engines. The NP/NV-231 case is a chain-driven unit that takes 21- or 23-spline input shafts. The 23-spline was for the AX-15 transmission, and the 21-spline was used for the AX-5 and BA 10/5 transmissions. Low range for this case was 2.72 and high range was 1.00.\n\nThe Command-Trac HD transfer case was used in 6-speed Liberty KJ's from 2005 to 2007. Although sometimes referred to as the \"NV(NP)231HD,\" the transfer cases are actually the 241 series used in full-sized trucks from other makers (241D or 241C). The Jeep version is labelled \"NV(NP)241J.\"  This is not the NV241OR transfer case found in the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, which uses a 4.0 low range and has a reinforced case. Dodge uses a 241DHD, which has a reinforced case but the 2.72 low-range.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee/Commander line no longer offers a part-time transfer case option. The reason behind this was its poor sales along with an improved Selec-Trac. ''Selec-Trac'' and a simplistic ''Quadra-Trac'' had the convenience and comfort of \"Full-Time\" all wheel drive that ''Command-Trac'' lacked for \"luxury\" SUV's that did not require the more rugged part-time system.\n\nThe terms \"Command-Trac\" and \"Selec-Trac\" were used in other Jeep lines and refer to different transfer cases in those lines.\n\nApplications:\n* 1984-2001 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] (XJ)\n* 1986-1992 [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ)\n* 1987\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler]] (YJ,TJ,JK,JL)\n* 1993-1995 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee#First generation (ZJ; 1993\u20131998)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ)\n* 2002-2007 [[Jeep Liberty#First generation KJ .282002.E2.80.932007.29|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KJ)\n* 1980-1987 [[Jeep Wagoneer|Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer]] (SJ)\n\n===Command-Trac II===\nCommand-Trac II works the same as [[Command-Trac]] but uses a console mounted switch to control the MP1522 transfer case as opposed to a floor mounted lever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/command_trac_2/ |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807002502/http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/command_trac_2/ |archivedate=2012-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nApplications:\n* 2008-2012 [[Jeep Liberty#Second generation KK (2008\u20132012)|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KK)\n\n==Rock-Trac==\nRock-Trac is similar to [[Command-Trac]] but uses the [[New Venture Gear]] NV241OR and adds [[locking differentials]] and 4:1 low gear ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeep.com/en/4x4/index.html#RockTrack, |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> In 2007 an electric front sway bar disconnect was added and the locking differentials switched from air-actuation to electric actuation.\n\nApplications:\n* 2003\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler]] Rubicon (TJ,JK,JL)\n* 2005\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler|Jeep Wrangler Unlimited]] Rubicon (TJ,JK,JL)\n* 2020\u2013Present [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)|Jeep Gladiator]] Rubicon (JT)\n\n==Selec-Trac==\n\n===Selec-Trac===\nSelec-Trac was first introduced in the full-size Jeeps (SJ) in 1983 using the [[New Process]] NP228 and NP229 transfer cases.  These are very similar to the Quadra-Trac NP219 transfer case described in the next section below.  The differences are 1) they added a 2WD mode for fuel savings and 2) the 2WD-to-4WD modes were controlled via a vacuum switch on the dashboard.  The Hi-N-Lo range selection was still performed using a shift lever on the console.  The NP228 differs from the NP229 by not having the viscous coupling in 4WD Hi mode, reverting to a simpler open center differential.  Both transfer cases still lock the center differential in 4WD Lo mode.  The NP228/229 transfer cases were available in the full-size Jeeps from 1983 to 1991.  The NP228 was also available in the XJ Cherokee and Wagoneers and the MJ Comanche pickups from 1984 until replaced by the NP242 in 1987.  Several companies have offered a dual shift lever conversion which replaces the vacuum switch and solenoid with a more reliable second console lever for 2WD-4WD mode selection.\n\nThe [[AMC Eagle]] used the NP119 transfer case in 1980, a strictly full-time all wheel drive model. From 1981 to 1988, a similar system was employed, dubbed \"Select-Drive\", which allowed the vehicle to switch from all wheel drive to 2WD using the NP129 model transfer case. The NP129 contained a viscous coupling around an open differential for added traction in slippery conditions. The NP128 has also been found equipped in select model years, which does not feature a viscous coupling.\n\nThe NP242 Selec-Trac transfer case debuted alongside the Fuel-Injected 4.0L Inline-6 in the compact Jeep Cherokee in 1987.  The shifter has modes 2WD - 4WD Hi Part-Time - 4WD Hi Full-Time - N - 4WD Low.  There is a center differential that is open in 4WD Hi Full-Time mode and distributes torque 48/52% front-to-rear.  This mode can be used on dry pavement or slippery surfaces with only a small fuel mileage penalty compared to 2WD mode.  In 4WD Hi Part-Time and 4WD Low, the center differential is mechanically locked, so these modes are for slippery surfaces only.<ref>http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/pdf.do?id=1506</ref>  Low range engages a 2.72:1 planetary gear ratio for increased torque and low speeds.  Overall, this system functions very much like the NP228 transfer case above, just with all of the mode and range controls via a single, console-mounted shift lever.  It was available in the 1987 to 2001 XJ Cherokee and Wagoneer, the 1987 to 1992 MJ Comanche, the 1993 to 2004 ZJ and WJ Grand Cherokees, the 2002 to 2007 KJ Liberty, and the 1998 to 2000 Dodge Durango.  It was replaced in the 2005 Grand Cherokee by the Quadra-Trac II system featuring the NV245 transfer case with 4WD Auto mode and in the 2008 KK Liberty by Selec-Trac II using the MP3022 transfer case.\n\nApplications:\n* 1983\u20131991 [[Jeep Wagoneer|Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer]] and [[Jeep Gladiator|Jeep full-size pickups]] (SJ)\n* 1984\u20132001 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer]] (XJ)\n* 1986\u20131992 [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ) *note, 1986 models were available with Selec-Trac utilizing only the NP228/NP229\n* 1993\u20132004 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ, WJ)\n* 1998\u20132000 [[Dodge Durango#First generation .281998.E2.80.932003.29|Dodge Durango]]\n* 2002\u20132007 [[Jeep Liberty (KJ)|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KJ)\n\n===Selec-Trac II===\nSelec-Trac II uses a console mounted switch to control the MP3022 transfer case. The switch controls the 4WD mode with options of 2WD - 4WD Auto - N - 4WD Low.  The MP3022 transfer case uses an electronically controlled clutch pack to bias torque from 100% rear to 50/50% front/rear.  The transfer case has no center differential, so power can only be supplied to the front axle when the rear wheels begin to slip.  In this way, the transfer case works almost identically to the NV247 transfer case used in the Quadra-Trac II system in 1999 to 2004 WJ Jeep Grand Cherokees.  In 4WD Low mode, the clutch pack is locked and power flows through a 2.72:1 planetary gear set for higher torque at lower speeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/selec_trac_2/ |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701043941/http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/selec_trac_2/ |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostjeeps.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=25830 |title=Selec-Trac II (MP 3022) and CommandTrac II (MP 1522) |publisher=lostjeeps.com/forum |date= |accessdate=2017-02-14}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 and newer JL Wrangler comes by default with Command-Trac, but its Sahara trim can be upgraded to Selec-Trac II, marketed as simply Selec-Trac, utilizing the MP3022 transfer case.\n\nApplications:\n* 2008\u20132012 [[Jeep Liberty (KK)|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KK)\n* 2018\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler]] Sahara (JL)\n\n==Quadra-Trac==\n[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - Blackberry with Crimson interior 17.jpg|thumb|right|Quadra-Trac transfer case in a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ]]\n[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - Blackberry with Crimson interior 14.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Quadra-Trac selector in a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ]]\nThe '''Quadra-Trac''' name is used on a variety of full-time 4WD systems.

It was a chain-drive system introduced in 1973 on the full-sized Jeep line behind the AMC version of the Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. CJ7s also received the Quadra-Trac starting in 1976. The BW1305 included 1) a differential with a cone-type slip-limiting clutch to distribute torque between the front and rear output shafts and 2) a vacuum-switch-operated differential lock. It offered only 4WD Hi modes in full-time (open) or part-time (locked) modes.  The BW1339 added a 2.57:1 low range gearset to the BW1305, enabling 5 modes: 4WD Hi Locked, 4WD Hi Open, Neutral, 4WD Low Open, and 4WD Low Locked.\n\nThe Jeep Quadra-Trac was differentiated from the open \"New Process\" Gear NP203 used by [[Dodge]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in that it included a center limited slip differential feature, in this case a clutch pack.\n\nApplications:\n* 1973-1979 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] (SJ)\n* 1973-1979 [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] (SJ)\n* 1973-1979 [[Jeep Gladiator]]\n* 1976-1979 [[Jeep CJ|Jeep CJ-7]]\n\nThe Borg-Warner system was replaced with a \"New Process Gear\" NP219-based system in 1980<ref>[http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/tech/quadratrac.html John, Full-size Jeep pages on wagoneers.com 25 February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928153820/http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/tech/quadratrac.html |date=28 September 2007 }}. Retrieved on 9 October 2010.</ref> The NP219 Quadra-Trac transfer case was available in full-size Jeep Cherokee, Wagoneer, and Grand Wagoneer from 1980 through 1982.  It offered the following modes: 4H LK, 4H, N, and 4L.  In 4H (full-time 4WD High) a center differential with a [[Limited-slip differential#Viscous|viscous limited-slip coupling]] is used between the front and rear output shafts.  A 2.61:1 low range was engaged in 4WD Lo mode.  And in both '4H LK' (4WD Hi Locked) and '4L' modes the center differential is mechanically locked.  The 'N' mode disengages the transfer case, transmission, and engine from the axles, thus enabling flat-towing the Jeep behind another vehicle.  In 1983, the NP219-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NP228/229-based [[Selec-Trac]], adding a fuel-saving 2WD mode to the full- and part-time 4WD modes of Quadra-Trac.\n\nApplications:\n* 1980-1982 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] and [[Jeep Gladiator|full-size pickups]] (SJ)\n\nIn 1993 Jeep re-introduced Quadra-Trac, this time on the Jeep Grand Cherokee using the NP249 transfer case. Like the NP219, this transfer case utilizes a center differential with a [[Limited-slip differential#Viscous|viscous coupler]] to provide smooth and efficient four-wheel drive operation on all surfaces.  This system has 4WD All-Time, Neutral, and 4WD Low modes.  In normal 4WD All-time mode, the center differential is open and distributes torque to both the front and rear axles.  When a difference in speed occurs between the axles, heat buildup causes the viscous fluid inside the coupler to thicken, which progressively locks the center differential thus transferring power to the axle with more traction.  In 4WD Low, the input torque is multiplied through a 2.72:1 planetary gearset.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCraw|first=Jim|title=4x4 when the going gets tough|journal=Popular Science|date=November 1992|volume=251|issue=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA110&dq=Jeep+four+wheel+drive+systems+serious+off-roading&hl=en|accessdate=10 October 2010|page=112}}</ref> NP249 transfer cases used the viscous coupler to transfer power in both high and low ranges.\n\nApplications:\n* 1993-1995 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee#ZJ .281993.E2.80.931998.29|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ)\n\nIn 1996 the NP249 was replaced with the [[New Venture Gear]] NV249 transfer case.  This added a mechanical differential lock to 4WD Low mode, making it much more durable for serious off-road use.  The NV249-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NV247-based [[Quadra-Trac II]] system for the 1999 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ).\n\nApplications:\n* 1996-1998 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee#ZJ .281993.E2.80.931998.29|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ)\n\n==Quadra-Trac II==\nQuadra-Trac II was introduced in 1999 and it employs a two-speed chain-driven [[transfer case]] featuring three modes of operation, \"4-All Time\", \"N\" or neutral, and \"4-Lo\". Two different transfer cases were used, the NV247 in 1999-2004 WJs and the NV245 in 2005-2010 WKs and 2006-2009 XKs.\n\nFor the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees using the NV247 transfer case, in \"4-All Time\" mode torque is applied to only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A [[gerotor]] pump is connected between the front and rear output shafts and senses any speed difference between them.  When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack.  The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear output shafts.  For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the [[gerotor]] pump causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards \"rear only\" unless the rear wheels are still slipping.  There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and rear output shafts cannot be locked without causing driveline binding.  The \"N\" or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In \"4-Lo\" mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and the front and rear axles are locked together through the clutch pack.  This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the [[Quadra-Drive]] system described below.\n\nIn 2005 Jeep replaced the [[New Venture Gear]] NV247 transfer case with the NV245 transfer case.  This transfer case actually has a center differential, allowing both the front and rear axles to have power supplied to them without driveline binding, even on dry pavement.  The torque distribution under normal driving conditions (no tire slippage) is 48% front and 52% rear.  There is also an electronically controlled variable lockup clutch pack that can apply progressive 0 to 100% locking across the center differential.  This is the improvement over the [[Selec-Trac]] NV242 transfer case, as that system has only fully unlocked and fully locked settings and requires manual shifting between them.  And finally, the NV245 has the 'N' and '4WD Low' modes which act in the same manner as in the NV247 transfer case above.\n\nThe major difference between the NV245-based Quadra-Trac II and [[Quadra-Drive II]] is that Quadra-Trac II uses the Brake Traction Control System (BTCS) instead of electronically controlled differentials.  When it senses a left-to-right speed differences between wheel hubs BTCS can apply each of the vehicle's brakes independently, similar to [[anti-lock brakes]], enabling Quadra-Trac II's open front and rear differentials to offer limited-slip capabilities.\n\nApplications:\n* 1999\u2013Present [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (WJ,WK,WK2)\n* 2006-2009 [[Jeep Commander]] (XK)\n\n===Quadra-Trac I===\nQuadra-Trac I was introduced in 2004 and works similarly to the [[Quadra-Trac II]] system, but eliminates the \"4 Lo\" and \"N\" or neutral modes. By excluding these modes it creates a system that requires no driver input.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/quadra_trac/ |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |accessdate=2012-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629211320/http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/quadra_trac/ |archivedate=2012-06-29 }}</ref> In 2005 Jeep added the [[Traction control system|brake traction control system]] and replaced the [[New Venture Gear]] NV147 transfer case<ref name=\"wjjeeps\">[http://www.wjjeeps.com/tcases.htm WJ Four-Wheel Drive Systems, WJ Jeeps.com].

These range from basic part-time systems that require the driver to move a control lever to send power to four wheels, to permanent four-wheel systems that monitor and sense traction needs at all four wheels automatically under all conditions.\n\n==Command-Trac==\n\n===Command-Trac===\nCommand-Trac was first introduced using the NP208 transfer case in the full-size Jeeps (SJ series) in 1980.  The drive modes are the same as with the Dana 18 and 20 transfer cases: 2Hi, 4HI PT, and 4LO PT.  The 4WD modes are not for use on high-traction surfaces such as dry roads.  The NP208 was used through at least 1987.\n\nMore commonly, ''Command-Trac'' is used to refer to the NP/NV-231 or NP-207 transfer cases introduced along with the '''[[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]]''' (XJ) in 1984. The system offers a chain-driven, aluminum, \"shift-on-the-fly\" transfer case. The \"shift-on-the-fly\" feature provides manual ease and assist while engaging 4WD. ''Command-Trac'' should only be driven in 4WD on low-traction surfaces due to the front and rear axles being locked together (no differential action in the transfer case). Driving in 4WD on dry pavement causes excessive tire and drivetrain wear. Four-wheel modes are most commonly used for wet/slick surfaces or extreme weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.) (4H), towing (N), and off-road activities (4L).\n\nThere are reports of a modified version known as NP-231J HD which was supposedly (SP) a \"heavy duty\" version for the [[Jeep_Grand_Cherokee#First_generation_(ZJ;_1993\u20131998)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] with V8 engines. The NP/NV-231 case is a chain-driven unit that takes 21- or 23-spline input shafts. The 23-spline was for the AX-15 transmission, and the 21-spline was used for the AX-5 and BA 10/5 transmissions. Low range for this case was 2.72 and high range was 1.00.\n\nThe Command-Trac HD transfer case was used in 6-speed Liberty KJ's from 2005 to 2007. Although sometimes referred to as the \"NV(NP)231HD,\" the transfer cases are actually the 241 series used in full-sized trucks from other makers (241D or 241C). The Jeep version is labelled \"NV(NP)241J.\"  This is not the NV241OR transfer case found in the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, which uses a 4.0 low range and has a reinforced case. Dodge uses a 241DHD, which has a reinforced case but the 2.72 low-range.\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee/Commander line no longer offers a part-time transfer case option. The reason behind this was its poor sales along with an improved Selec-Trac. ''Selec-Trac'' and a simplistic ''Quadra-Trac'' had the convenience and comfort of \"Full-Time\" all wheel drive that ''Command-Trac'' lacked for \"luxury\" SUV's that did not require the more rugged part-time system.\n\nThe terms \"Command-Trac\" and \"Selec-Trac\" were used in other Jeep lines and refer to different transfer cases in those lines.\n\nApplications:\n* 1984-2001 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] (XJ)\n* 1986-1992 [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ)\n* 1987\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler]] (YJ,TJ,JK,JL)\n* 1993-1995 [[Jeep_Grand_Cherokee#First_generation_(ZJ;_1993\u20131998)|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ)\n* 2002-2007 [[Jeep_Liberty#First_generation_KJ_.282002.E2.80.932007.29|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KJ)\n* 1980-1987 [[Jeep Wagoneer|Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer]] (SJ)\n\n===Command-Trac II===\nCommand-Trac II works the same as [[Command-Trac]] but uses a console mounted switch to control the MP1522 transfer case as opposed to a floor mounted lever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/command_trac_2/ |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807002502/http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/command_trac_2/ |archivedate=2012-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nApplications:\n* 2008-2012 [[Jeep_Liberty#Second_generation_KK_(2008\u20132012)|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KK)\n\n==Rock-Trac==\nRock-Trac is similar to [[Command-Trac]] but uses the [[New Venture Gear]] NV241OR and adds [[locking differentials]] and 4:1 low gear ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeep.com/en/4x4/index.html#RockTrack, |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}</ref> In 2007 an electric front sway bar disconnect was added and the locking differentials switched from air-actuation to electric actuation.\n\nApplications:\n* 2003\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler]] Rubicon (TJ,JK,JL)\n* 2005\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler|Jeep Wrangler Unlimited]] Rubicon (TJ,JK,JL)\n* 2020\u2013Present [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)|Jeep Gladiator]] Rubicon (JT)\n\n==Selec-Trac==\n\n===Selec-Trac===\nSelec-Trac was first introduced in the full-size Jeeps (SJ) in 1983 using the [[New Process]] NP228 and NP229 transfer cases.  These are very similar to the Quadra-Trac NP219 transfer case described in the next section below.  The differences are 1) they added a 2WD mode for fuel savings and 2) the 2WD-to-4WD modes were controlled via a vacuum switch on the dashboard.  The Hi-N-Lo range selection was still performed using a shift lever on the console.  The NP228 differs from the NP229 by not having the viscous coupling in 4WD Hi mode, reverting to a simpler open center differential.  Both transfer cases still lock the center differential in 4WD Lo mode.  The NP228/229 transfer cases were available in the full-size Jeeps from 1983 to 1991.  The NP228 was also available in the XJ Cherokee and Wagoneers and the MJ Comanche pickups from 1984 until replaced by the NP242 in 1987.  Several companies have offered a dual shift lever conversion which replaces the vacuum switch and solenoid with a more reliable second console lever for 2WD-4WD mode selection.\n\nThe [[AMC Eagle]] used the NP119 transfer case in 1980, a strictly full-time all wheel drive model. From 1981 to 1988, a similar system was employed, dubbed \"Select-Drive\", which allowed the vehicle to switch from all wheel drive to 2WD using the NP129 model transfer case. The NP129 contained a viscous coupling around an open differential for added traction in slippery conditions. The NP128 has also been found equipped in select model years, which does not feature a viscous coupling.\n\nThe NP242 Selec-Trac transfer case debuted alongside the Fuel-Injected 4.0L Inline-6 in the compact Jeep Cherokee in 1987.  The shifter has modes 2WD - 4WD Hi Part-Time - 4WD Hi Full-Time - N - 4WD Low.  There is a center differential that is open in 4WD Hi Full-Time mode and distributes torque 48/52% front-to-rear.  This mode can be used on dry pavement or slippery surfaces with only a small fuel mileage penalty compared to 2WD mode.  In 4WD Hi Part-Time and 4WD Low, the center differential is mechanically locked, so these modes are for slippery surfaces only.<ref>http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/pdf.do?id=1506</ref>  Low range engages a 2.72:1 planetary gear ratio for increased torque and low speeds.  Overall, this system functions very much like the NP228 transfer case above, just with all of the mode and range controls via a single, console-mounted shift lever.  It was available in the 1987 to 2001 XJ Cherokee and Wagoneer, the 1987 to 1992 MJ Comanche, the 1993 to 2004 ZJ and WJ Grand Cherokees, the 2002 to 2007 KJ Liberty, and the 1998 to 2000 Dodge Durango.  It was replaced in the 2005 Grand Cherokee by the Quadra-Trac II system featuring the NV245 transfer case with 4WD Auto mode and in the 2008 KK Liberty by Selec-Trac II using the MP3022 transfer case.\n\nApplications:\n* 1983\u20131991 [[Jeep Wagoneer|Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer]] and [[Jeep Gladiator|Jeep full-size pickups]] (SJ)\n* 1984\u20132001 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer]] (XJ)\n* 1986\u20131992 [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ) *note, 1986 models were available with Selec-Trac utilizing only the NP228/NP229\n* 1993\u20132004 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ, WJ)\n* 1998\u20132000 [[Dodge Durango#First_generation_.281998.E2.80.932003.29|Dodge Durango]]\n* 2002\u20132007 [[Jeep_Liberty (KJ)|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KJ)\n\n===Selec-Trac II===\nSelec-Trac II uses a console mounted switch to control the MP3022 transfer case. The switch controls the 4WD mode with options of 2WD - 4WD Auto - N - 4WD Low.  The MP3022 transfer case uses an electronically controlled clutch pack to bias torque from 100% rear to 50/50% front/rear.  The transfer case has no center differential, so power can only be supplied to the front axle when the rear wheels begin to slip.  In this way, the transfer case works almost identically to the NV247 transfer case used in the Quadra-Trac II system in 1999 to 2004 WJ Jeep Grand Cherokees.  In 4WD Low mode, the clutch pack is locked and power flows through a 2.72:1 planetary gear set for higher torque at lower speeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/selec_trac_2/ |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701043941/http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/selec_trac_2/ |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostjeeps.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=25830 |title=Selec-Trac II (MP 3022) and CommandTrac II (MP 1522) |publisher=lostjeeps.com/forum |date= |accessdate=2017-02-14}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 and newer JL Wrangler comes by default with Command-Trac, but its Sahara trim can be upgraded to Selec-Trac II, marketed as simply Selec-Trac, utilizing the MP3022 transfer case.\n\nApplications:\n* 2008\u20132012 [[Jeep_Liberty (KK)|Jeep Liberty/Cherokee]] (KK)\n* 2018\u2013Present [[Jeep Wrangler]] Sahara (JL)\n\n==Quadra-Trac==\n[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - Blackberry with Crimson interior 17.jpg|thumb|right|Quadra-Trac transfer case in a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ]]\n[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - Blackberry with Crimson interior 14.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Quadra-Trac selector in a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ]]\nThe '''Quadra-Trac''' name is used on a variety of full-time 4WD systems.

And from 1996 to 1998 the transfer case was manufactured by [[New Venture Gear]]  with some minor improvements and it was renamed the NV249.\n\nQuadra-Trac was the trade name for the [[Borg-Warner]] 1305 and 1339 gear cases. It was a chain-drive system introduced in 1973 on the full-sized Jeep line behind the AMC version of the Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. CJ7s also received the Quadra-Trac starting in 1976. The BW1305 included 1) a differential with a cone-type slip-limiting clutch to distribute torque between the front and rear output shafts and 2) a vacuum-switch-operated differential lock. It offered only 4WD Hi modes in full-time (open) or part-time (locked) modes.  The BW1339 added a 2.57:1 low range gearset to the BW1305, enabling 5 modes: 4WD Hi Locked, 4WD Hi Open, Neutral, 4WD Low Open, and 4WD Low Locked.\n\nThe Jeep Quadra-Trac was differentiated from the open \"New Process\" Gear NP203 used by [[Dodge]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in that it included a center limited slip differential feature, in this case a clutch pack.\n\nApplications:\n* 1973-1979 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] (SJ)\n* 1973-1979 [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] (SJ)\n* 1973-1979 [[Jeep Gladiator]]\n* 1976-1979 [[Jeep CJ|Jeep CJ-7]]\n\nThe Borg-Warner system was replaced with a \"New Process Gear\" NP219-based system in 1980<ref>[http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/tech/quadratrac.html John, Full-size Jeep pages on wagoneers.com 25 February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928153820/http://wagoneers.com/FSJ/tech/quadratrac.html |date=28 September 2007 }}. Retrieved on 9 October 2010.</ref> The NP219 Quadra-Trac transfer case was available in full-size Jeep Cherokee, Wagoneer, and Grand Wagoneer from 1980 through 1982.  It offered the following modes: 4H LK, 4H, N, and 4L.  In 4H (full-time 4WD High) a center differential with a [[Limited-slip_differential#Viscous|viscous limited-slip coupling]] is used between the front and rear output shafts.  A 2.61:1 low range was engaged in 4WD Lo mode.  And in both '4H LK' (4WD Hi Locked) and '4L' modes the center differential is mechanically locked.  The 'N' mode disengages the transfer case, transmission, and engine from the axles, thus enabling flat-towing the Jeep behind another vehicle.  In 1983, the NP219-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NP228/229-based [[Selec-Trac]], adding a fuel-saving 2WD mode to the full- and part-time 4WD modes of Quadra-Trac.\n\nApplications:\n* 1980-1982 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] and [[Jeep Gladiator|full-size pickups]] (SJ)\n\nIn 1993 Jeep re-introduced Quadra-Trac, this time on the Jeep Grand Cherokee using the NP249 transfer case. Like the NP219, this transfer case utilizes a center differential with a [[Limited-slip_differential#Viscous|viscous coupler]] to provide smooth and efficient four-wheel drive operation on all surfaces.  This system has 4WD All-Time, Neutral, and 4WD Low modes.  In normal 4WD All-time mode, the center differential is open and distributes torque to both the front and rear axles.  When a difference in speed occurs between the axles, heat buildup causes the viscous fluid inside the coupler to thicken, which progressively locks the center differential thus transferring power to the axle with more traction.  In 4WD Low, the input torque is multiplied through a 2.72:1 planetary gearset.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCraw|first=Jim|title=4x4 when the going gets tough|journal=Popular Science|date=November 1992|volume=251|issue=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA110&dq=Jeep+four+wheel+drive+systems+serious+off-roading&hl=en|accessdate=10 October 2010|page=112}}</ref> NP249 transfer cases used the viscous coupler to transfer power in both high and low ranges.\n\nApplications:\n* 1993-1995 [[Jeep_Grand_Cherokee#ZJ_.281993.E2.80.931998.29|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ)\n\nIn 1996 the NP249 was replaced with the [[New Venture Gear]] NV249 transfer case.  This added a mechanical differential lock to 4WD Low mode, making it much more durable for serious off-road use.  The NV249-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NV247-based [[Quadra-Trac II]] system for the 1999 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ).\n\nApplications:\n* 1996-1998 [[Jeep_Grand_Cherokee#ZJ_.281993.E2.80.931998.29|Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (ZJ)\n\n==Quadra-Trac II==\nQuadra-Trac II was introduced in 1999 and it employs a two-speed chain-driven [[transfer case]] featuring three modes of operation, \"4-All Time\", \"N\" or neutral, and \"4-Lo\". Two different transfer cases were used, the NV247 in 1999-2004 WJs and the NV245 in 2005-2010 WKs and 2006-2009 XKs.\n\nFor the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees using the NV247 transfer case, in \"4-All Time\" mode torque is applied to only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A [[gerotor]] pump is connected between the front and rear output shafts and senses any speed difference between them.  When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack.  The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear output shafts.  For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the [[gerotor]] pump causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards \"rear only\" unless the rear wheels are still slipping.  There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and rear output shafts cannot be locked without causing driveline binding.  The \"N\" or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In \"4-Lo\" mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and the front and rear axles are locked together through the clutch pack.  This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the [[Quadra-Drive]] system described below.\n\nIn 2005 Jeep replaced the [[New Venture Gear]] NV247 transfer case with the NV245 transfer case.  This transfer case actually has a center differential, allowing both the front and rear axles to have power supplied to them without driveline binding, even on dry pavement.  The torque distribution under normal driving conditions (no tire slippage) is 48% front and 52% rear.  There is also an electronically controlled variable lockup clutch pack that can apply progressive 0 to 100% locking across the center differential.  This is the improvement over the [[Selec-Trac]] NV242 transfer case, as that system has only fully unlocked and fully locked settings and requires manual shifting between them.  And finally, the NV245 has the 'N' and '4WD Low' modes which act in the same manner as in the NV247 transfer case above.\n\nThe major difference between the NV245-based Quadra-Trac II and [[Quadra-Drive II]] is that Quadra-Trac II uses the Brake Traction Control System (BTCS) instead of electronically controlled differentials.  When it senses a left-to-right speed differences between wheel hubs BTCS can apply each of the vehicle's brakes independently, similar to [[anti-lock brakes]], enabling Quadra-Trac II's open front and rear differentials to offer limited-slip capabilities.\n\nApplications:\n* 1999\u2013Present [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] (WJ,WK,WK2)\n* 2006-2009 [[Jeep Commander]] (XK)\n\n===Quadra-Trac I===\nQuadra-Trac I was introduced in 2004 and works similarly to the [[Quadra-Trac II]] system, but eliminates the \"4 Lo\" and \"N\" or neutral modes. By excluding these modes it creates a system that requires no driver input.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/quadra_trac/ |title=Jeep 4x4 Basics |publisher=jeep.com |accessdate=2012-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629211320/http://m.jeep.com/en/4x4/how_systems_work/quadra_trac/ |archivedate=2012-06-29 }}</ref> In 2005 Jeep added the [[Traction control system|brake traction control system]] and replaced the [[New Venture Gear]] NV147 transfer case<ref name=\"wjjeeps\">[http://www.wjjeeps.com/tcases.htm WJ Four-Wheel Drive Systems, WJ Jeeps.com].
