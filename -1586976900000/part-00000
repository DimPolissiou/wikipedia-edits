Schulz]] \"[[Peanuts]]\" [[comic strip]] characters. [[Camp Snoopy]] themed areas are still located at [[Cedar Point]] and [[Knott's Berry Farm]], also owned by Cedar Fair. Camp Snoopy was never aggressively themed to the Peanuts franchise; the park had a very outdoors and woodsy feel with more subtle references to the Peanuts franchise. Much of the original theming in the Camp Snoopy fountain and all around the park was already toned down by the time the rights to the Peanuts characters were lost. Theming that was removed from the park prematurely and was never replaced includes various kites near the ceiling, [[Charlie Brown]] and [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] playing [[baseball]] above the Sports Grill restaurant (although their baseball remained suspended in the air afterwards), theming in Snoopy fountain, the retheming of Snoopy Boutique, Snoopy Bouncer, the Snoopy Shop<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/eawpeanuts/eawpeanuts/camp_snoopy.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509084043/http://members.aol.com/eawpeanuts/eawpeanuts/camp_snoopy.htm|archive-date=May 9, 2006|title=Camp Snoopy|website=[[AOL]]}}</ref> and much smaller theming.

However, this did not last long, as there were even bigger and unexpected changes coming within the next few months.\n\n====The Park at MOA====\nOn January 9, 2006, Mall of America management announced that talks between MOA and [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Co.]] (which owns the national rights to amusement-park branding of the Peanuts license) had broken down, primarily over the mall's rights to effectively market its park within and outside the United States, and effective January 19, the park's Peanuts branding would end, the park being temporarily renamed '''The Park at MOA''' while new branding was being applied.

The shooting gallery beneath the Ripsaw/Orange Streak roller coaster was gutted and was replaced by Rugrats Reptarmobiles. The Mystery Mine Ride was completely demolished to make way for SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge. This site also included an Old Time Photography studio and restrooms. Old Time Photography relocated into the mall (but not within the park) and restrooms did not return in this section of the park. [[Levy Restaurants]] partnered with Nickelodeon Universe to include a themed restaurant at the park. The restaurant was called EATS and was located in the former Park at MOA food court. When the partnership ended, the EATS area closed and was replaced with a butterfly display. In 2014, a [[Hard Rock Cafe]] opened on the site where EATS once stood.\n\nOn March 12, 2008, the Star Tribune reported that the price of ride points, daily wristbands and, in particular, annual passes, would take a significant price hike once the park transitioned to Nickelodeon Universe. The price for an annual pass, which had remained $99 per year since the park opened in 1992, would increase to $250, and daily wristbands would be raised from $24.95 to $29.95. They eventually rose to $32.99 in 2014. Then in 2017, prices rose to where they currently stand at $35.99 for a daily wristband. On April 2015, the price for the annual pass drops down to $139. Some decreed the price increases as being unjustifiably high when compared to other parks, such as local park [[Valleyfair]] at $79.95\u2013$99.95. Others defended the pricing as necessary to accommodate the millions of dollars of investment needed to rebrand the park as Nickelodeon Universe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/16582921.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511183927/http://www.startribune.com/local/west/16582921.html|archive-date=May 11, 2008|title=New Mall of America rides put an exra nick in your wallet|work=[[Star Tribune]]}}</ref>\n\n===Rides and attractions===\n\n====Roller coasters====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em;\" | Name\n! style=\"width:2em;\" | Opened\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Manufacturer\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Make/Model\n!

Losing his grip, Martin fell off the chute, falling onto the landscaping rocks. He then died as a result of his injuries. O.D.

Schulz]] \"[[Peanuts]]\" [[comic strip]] characters. [[Camp Snoopy]] themed areas are still located at [[Cedar Point]] and [[Knott's Berry Farm]], also owned by Cedar Fair. Camp Snoopy was never aggressively themed to the Peanuts franchise; the park had a very outdoors and woodsy feel with more subtle references to the Peanuts franchise. Much of the original theming in the Camp Snoopy fountain and all around the park was already toned down by the time the rights to the Peanuts characters were lost. Theming that was removed from the park prematurely and was never replaced includes various kites near the ceiling, [[Charlie Brown]] and [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] playing [[baseball]] above the Sports Grill restaurant (although their baseball remained suspended in the air afterwards), theming in Snoopy fountain, the retheming of Snoopy Boutique, Snoopy Bouncer, the Snoopy Shop<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/eawpeanuts/eawpeanuts/camp_snoopy.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509084043/http://members.aol.com/eawpeanuts/eawpeanuts/camp_snoopy.htm|archive-date=May 9, 2006|title=Camp Snoopy|website=[[AOL]]}}</ref> and much smaller theming.

The shooting gallery beneath the Ripsaw/Orange Streak roller coaster was gutted and was replaced by Rugrats Reptarmobiles. The Mystery Mine Ride was completely demolished to make way for SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge. This site also included an Old Time Photography studio and restrooms. Old Time Photography relocated into the mall (but not within the park) and restrooms did not return in this section of the park. [[Levy Restaurants]] partnered with Nickelodeon Universe to include a themed restaurant at the park. The restaurant was called EATS and was located in the former Park at MOA food court. When the partnership ended, the EATS area closed and was replaced with a butterfly display. In 2014, a [[Hard Rock Cafe]] opened on the site where EATS once stood.\n\nOn March 12, 2008, the Star Tribune reported that the price of ride points, daily wristbands and, in particular, annual passes, would take a significant price hike once the park transitioned to Nickelodeon Universe. The price for an annual pass, which had remained $99 per year since the park opened in 1992, would increase to $250, and daily wristbands would be raised from $24.95 to $29.95. They eventually rose to $32.99 in 2014. Then in 2017, prices rose to where they currently stand at $35.99 for a daily wristband. On April 2015, the price for the annual pass drops down to $139. Some decreed the price increases as being unjustifiably high when compared to other parks, such as local park [[Valleyfair]] at $79.95\u2013$99.95. Others defended the pricing as necessary to accommodate the millions of dollars of investment needed to rebrand the park as Nickelodeon Universe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/16582921.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511183927/http://www.startribune.com/local/west/16582921.html|archive-date=May 11, 2008|title=New Mall of America rides put an exra nick in your wallet|work=[[Star Tribune]]}}</ref>\n\n===Rides and attractions===\n\n====Roller coasters====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em;\" | Name\n! style=\"width:2em;\" | Opened\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Manufacturer\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Make/Model\n!
