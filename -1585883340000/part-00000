Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers in Olympus. We [birds] are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.}}\n\nIn [[Plato]]\u2019s Timaeus, the main work of Platonic cosmology, the concept of chaos finds its equivalent in the Greek expression ''ch\u00f4ra'', which is interpreted, for instance, as shapeless space (''ch\u00f4ra'') in which material traces (''ichn\u00ea'') of the elements are in disordered motion (Timaeus 53a\u2013b). However, the Platonic ''ch\u00f4ra'' is not a variation of the atomistic interpretation of the origin of the world, as is made clear by Plato's statement that the most appropriate definition of the ch\u00f4ra is \"a receptacle of all becoming \u2013 its wetnurse, as it were\" (Timaeus 49a), notabene a receptacle for the creative act of the demiurge, the world-maker.<ref>Lobenhofer, Stefan (2020): Chaos.

Firstly, blackwinged Night laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebus, and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartarus with dark Chaos, winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race, which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the imperishable race of blessed gods sprang into being. Thus our origin is very much older than that of the dwellers in Olympus. We [birds] are the offspring of Eros; there are a thousand proofs to show it. We have wings and we lend assistance to lovers. How many handsome youths, who had sworn to remain insensible, have opened their thighs because of our power and have yielded themselves to their lovers when almost at the end of their youth, being led away by the gift of a quail, a waterfowl, a goose, or a cock.}}\n\nIn [[Plato]]\u2019s Timaeus, the main work of Platonic cosmology, the concept of chaos finds its equivalent in the Greek expression ''ch\u00f4ra'', which is interpreted, for instance, as shapeless space (''ch\u00f4ra'') in which material traces (''ichn\u00ea'') of the elements are in disordered motion (Timaeus 53a\u2013b). However, the Platonic ''ch\u00f4ra'' is not a variation of the atomistic interpretation of the origin of the world, as is made clear by Plato's statement that the most appropriate definition of the ch\u00f4ra is \"a receptacle of all becoming \u2013 its wetnurse, as it were\" (Timaeus 49a), notabene a receptacle for the creative act of the demiurge, the world-maker.<ref>Lobenhofer, Stefan (2020): Chaos.

The first stage of the process of producing the [[philosopher's stone]], i.e., [[nigredo]], was identified with chaos. Because of association with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], where \"the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Gen. 1:2), Chaos was further identified with the [[classical element]] of [[Water (classical element)|Water]].\n\n[[Ramon Llull]] (1232\u20131315) wrote a ''Liber Chaos'', in which he identifies Chaos as the primal form or matter created by God. Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]] (1493\u20131541) uses ''chaos'' synonymously with \"classical element\" (because the primeval chaos is imagined as a formless congestion of all elements). Paracelsus thus identifies [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] as \"the chaos of the ''gnomi''\", i.e., the element of the [[gnome]]s, through which these spirits move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds through air.<ref>De Nymphis etc. Wks. 1658 II. 391{{full citation needed |date=April 2019}}</ref> An alchemical treatise by [[Heinrich Khunrath]], printed in Frankfurt in 1708, was entitled ''Chaos''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Khunrath |first=Heinrich |authorlink=Heinrich Khunrath |title=Vom Hylealischen, das ist Pri-materialischen Catholischen oder Allgemeinen Nat\u00fcrlichen Chaos der naturgem\u00e4ssen Alchymiae und Alchymisten: Confessio |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X1g6AAAAcAAJ |year=1708 |ref=harv}}</ref> The 1708 introduction states that the treatise was written in 1597 in Magdeburg, in the author's 23rd year of practicing alchemy.{{sfn|Szulakowska |2000 |p=79}} The treatise purports to quote Paracelsus on the point that \"The light of the soul, by the will of the Triune God, made all earthly things appear from the primal Chaos.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Szulakowska |2000 |p=91}}, quoting {{harvtxt|Khunrath|1708|p=68}}</ref> [[Martin Ruland the Younger]], in his 1612 ''Lexicon Alchemiae'', states, \"A crude mixture of matter or another name for ''Materia Prima'' is ''Chaos'', as it is in the Beginning.\"\n\nThe term ''[[gas]]'' in [[chemistry]] was coined by Dutch chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] in the 17th century directly based on the Paracelsian notion of chaos.

North Dakota left the Big Sky Conference for the non-football [[Summit League]] in 2018, and will join the MVFC in 2020. During this transition, North Dakota is classified as an FCS independent but continues to play a full Big Sky football schedule, with games counting in the Big Sky standings for their opponents.\n\nAs of the start of the 2019 season, the longest-tenured coaches in Division I FCS are [[Kevin Callahan]] of [[Monmouth Hawks football|Monmouth]] and [[Jim Parady]] of [[Marist Red Foxes football|Marist]], who have been head coaches at their respective schools since 1992. In all, 24 FCS programs had new head coaches in 2018.\n\nConference affiliations are current for the upcoming [[2020 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2020 season]].\n\n==Coaches==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In 1957, he refused to comply with a unanimous decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1954 case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', and ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to prevent black students from attending [[Little Rock Central High School]]. This event became known as the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nOrval Eugene Faubus was born in the northwest corner of Arkansas near the village of [[Combs, Arkansas|Combs]] to [[Sam Faubus|John Samuel]] and Addie ([[n\u00e9e]] Joslen) Faubus.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nFaubus's first political race was in 1936 when he contested a seat in the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]], which he lost. He was urged to challenge the result but declined, which earned him the gratitude of the Democratic Party. As a result, he was elected circuit clerk and recorder of Madison County, a post he held for two terms.<ref name=\"EAHC\">{{cite web| title=Oral Eugene Faubus (1910-1994)| work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas| date=22 September 2011| url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=102| \npublisher=Central Arkansas Library System| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\nWhen the United States entered [[World War II]], Faubus joined the United States Army and served as an intelligence officer with the [[US Third Army|Third Army]] of General [[George Patton]]. He rose to the rank of major and was in combat several times. His book, ''In This Faraway Land'', documents the military period of his life.  He was active in veterans' causes for the remainder of his life.\n\nWhen Faubus returned from the war, he cultivated ties with leaders of Arkansas' Democratic Party, particularly with progressive reform Governor [[Sid McMath]], leader of the post-war \"GI Revolt\" against corruption, under whom he served as director of the state's highway commission. Meanwhile, conservative Francis Cherry defeated McMath's bid for a third term in the 1952 Democratic primary. Cherry became unpopular with voters, and Faubus challenged him in the 1954 primary.\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1954==\nIn the 1954 campaign, Faubus was compelled to defend his attendance at the defunct northwest Arkansas [[Commonwealth College, Arkansas|Commonwealth College]] in [[Mena, Arkansas|Mena]], as well as his early political upbringing. Commonwealth College had been formed by leftist academic and social activists, some of whom later were revealed to have had close ties with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States of America]]. Most of those who attended and taught there were idealistic young people who sought an education or, in the case of the faculty, a job which came with room and board.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\">Reed (1997).</ref>\n\n===Democratic primary===\nDuring the runoff, Cherry and his surrogates accused Faubus of having attended a \"communist\" school and implied that his sympathies remained leftist. Faubus at first denied attending, and then admitted enrolling \"for only a few weeks\". Later, it was shown that he had remained at the school for more than a year, earned good grades, and was elected student body president. Faubus led a group of students who testified on behalf of the college's accreditation before the state legislature. Nevertheless, efforts to paint the candidate as a communist sympathizer backfired in a climate of growing resentment against such allegations. Faubus narrowly defeated Cherry to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.  Relations were cool between the two men for years, but when Cherry died in 1965, Faubus put politics aside and was magnanimous in praising his predecessor.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\n===General election===\nIn the 1954 [[general election]] campaign against Little Rock [[Mayor]] [[Pratt C. Remmel]], Faubus secured the endorsement of the previous 1950 and 1952 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial nominee, [[Jefferson W. Speck]], a planter from [[Mississippi County, Arkansas|Mississippi County]] in eastern Arkansas.<ref name=\"down\">{{cite book| title=Down from the Hills| author=Orval Faubus| publisher=Pioneer Press| year=1980| page=59}}</ref> Faubus defeated Remmel by a 63% to 37% percent margin. Remmel, a businessman and scion of a prominent Republican family, polled the strongest vote at the time for a GOP candidate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Faubus rejected his father's radicalism for the more mainline [[New Deal]], a pragmatic move. He was elected governor as a liberal Democrat. A moderate on racial issues, his political realism resurfaced as he adopted racial policies that were palatable to influential white voters in the [[Arkansas Delta|Delta]] region as part of a strategy to affect key social reforms and economic growth in Arkansas.<ref>Reed (2007)</ref>\n\n==Governor of Arkansas (1955-1967)==\nThe 1954 election made Faubus sensitive to attacks from the political right. It has been suggested that this sensitivity contributed to his later stance against integration when he was challenged by segregationist elements within his own party. He was known as a particularly effective one-on-one campaigner and was said to have never turned away anyone who sought to shake his hand, no matter how much time it took.\n\n==Little Rock crisis==\n{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}\n[[Image:Little Rock Nine protest.jpg|thumb|260px|Faubus speaking to a crowd protesting the integration of Little Rock schools]]\nFaubus' name became internationally known during the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]] of 1957, when he used the Arkansas National Guard to stop [[African Americans]] from attending Little Rock Central High School as part of federally ordered racial desegregation.\n\nCritics have long charged that Faubus' fight in Little Rock against the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] that separate schools were inherently unequal was politically motivated. The ensuing battle helped to shield him from the political fallout from the tax increase and to diminish Johnson's appeal. Journalist [[Harry Ashmore]] (who won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his columns on the subject) portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus. Ashmore said that Faubus used the Guard to keep blacks out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to arouse white voters.\n\nFaubus' decision led to a showdown with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and former Governor [[Sid McMath]]. On September 5, 1957, Eisenhower sent a telegram to Governor Orval E. Faubus in which he wrote \"The only assurance I can give you is that the Federal Constitution will be upheld by me by every legal means at my command.\" This was a response to Faubus' concerns about being taken into custody and his telephones being wired. Eisenhower did say in his telegram that the Department of Justice was collecting facts as to why there was a failure to comply with the courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Press_release_DDE_telegram_to_Faubus.pdf|title=The President Today Sent the Following Telegram to the Honorable Oral E. Faubus, The Governor of Arkansas|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This sparked the September 14, 1957 conference where Faubus and Eisenhower discussed the Court order in Newport, Rhode Island. The quoted \"friendly and constructive discussion\" led to the Governor claiming his desire to comply with his duty to the Constitution, personal opinions aside. The Governor did express his hope that the Department of Justice would be patient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Statements_by_DDE_and_Faubus.pdf|title=Press Release of Statement by the President and Governor Faubus|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 14, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The Arkansas Governor did stay true to his word and on September 21, 1957 President Eisenhower released a statement which announced that the Governor withdrew his troops, the Little Rock School Board was carrying out desegregation plans, and local law was ready to keep order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_21_Statement_by_President.pdf|title=Press Release; Statement by the President|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 21, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> On September 23, 1957, however, Mayor Woodrow Wilson Mann sent a telegram to Dwight Eisenhower stating a mob had formed at Central High School in Little Rock. State Police made efforts to control the mob, but for the safety of the newly enrolled children, they were sent home. The Mayor stressed how this was a planned act and that the principal agitator, Jimmy Karam, was an associate of Governor Faubus. The Mayor further explained how there was no way the Governor could not have been aware of this planned attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_23_Mann_to_DDE.pdf|title=Telegram from Mayor Mann to Eisenhower|last=Mann|first=Woodrow|date=September 23, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In October 1957, Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to return to their armories which effectively removed them from Faubus' control. Eisenhower then sent elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Arkansas to protect the black students and enforce the Federal court order. The Arkansas National Guard later took over protection duties from the 101st Airborne Division. In retaliation, Faubus shut down Little Rock high schools for the 1958\u20131959 school year. This is often referred to as \"The Lost Year\" in Little Rock.<ref>Freyer (2007)</ref> In a 1985 interview with a Huntsville Arkansas student, Faubus stated that the Crisis was due to an \"Usurpation of power\" by the Federal Government. The State knew forced integration by the Federal Government was going to meet with unfavorable results from the Little Rock public. In his opinion, he was acting in his State's best interest at the time.\n\nThough Faubus later lost general popularity as a result of his stand against desegregation, at the time he was included among the \"Ten Men in the World Most Admired by Americans\", according to [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] for 1958. This dichotomy was later summed up as follows: Faubus was both the \"best loved\" and \"most hated\" of Arkansas politicians of the second half of the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Faubus-style politics===\nFaubus was elected governor to six two-year terms and hence served for twelve years. He maintained a defiant, populist image, while he shifted toward a less confrontational stance with the federal government, particularly during the administrations of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], with each of whom he remained cordial, and both of whom carried Arkansas.\n\nIn the 1956 general election, Faubus, having already eliminated Jim Johnson, overwhelmed GOP candidate Roy Mitchell, later the GOP state chairman from [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]],  321,797 (80.7%) to 77,215 (19.4%). In 1958, he defeated Republican George W. Johnson of [[Greenwood, Arkansas|Greenwood]] in Sebastian County by drawing 82.5% of the votes.\n\nIn 1960, Faubus defeated [[Attorney General]] [[Bruce Bennett (Arkansas politician)|Bruce Bennett]] in the Democratic gubernatorial primary for and then crushed the Republican choice, [[Henry M. Britt]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]] from Hot Springs, to secure reelection. Faubus polled 292,064 votes (69.2%) to Britt's 129,921 (30.8%). In the presidential election contest, however, Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] won Arkansas over the Republican [[Richard M. Nixon]] by less than expected. Britt was later a circuit judge in [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]] from 1967 to 1983.\n\nIn 1962, Faubus broke with the [[White Citizens' Council]]s and other groups, who preferred, but did not officially endorse, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Dale Alford]] in that year's gubernatorial primary.<ref>{{cite book| first=Neil R| last=McMillen | title=The Citizens' Council: Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction 1954\u201364| publisher=University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-252-06441-8| page=285}}</ref> Faubus cast himself as a moderate, he completely ignored the race issue during the 1962 election campaign, and barely secured a majority over Alford, McMath, and three other candidates. He then handily defeated the Republican Willis Ricketts, a then 37-year-old pharmacist from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] in the general election.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nWhile Faubus was still an outcast from black leaders, he nevertheless won a large percent of the black vote. In 1964, when he defeated the Republican [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] by a 57-43 percent margin, Faubus secured 81 percent of the black vote. He even collected a share of the base Republican vote from the conservative party members who had sided with former Republican state chairman [[William L. Spicer]] of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], an intraparty rival of Rockefeller.\n\n==Presidential election of 1960==\nDuring the 1960 presidential election, at a secret meeting held in a rural lodge near Dayton, Ohio, the [[National States Rights Party]] (NSRP) nominated Orval Faubus for President and retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral [[John G. Crommelin]] of Alabama for Vice President. Faubus, however, did not campaign on this ticket actively, and won only 0.07% of the vote (best in his native Arkansas: 6.76%), losing to the [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ticket.\n\n==Later life==\nFaubus chose not to run for re-election to a seventh term in what would likely have been a difficult race in 1966. Former gubernatorial candidate [[James D. Johnson]], by then an elected [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] Justice, narrowly won the Democratic nomination over another justice, the moderate Frank Holt. Johnson was then defeated in the general election by Winthrop Rockefeller, who became the state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction.  Years later, Johnson himself became a Republican and supported Governor [[Frank D. White]], later a benefactor of Faubus.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nIn [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], Faubus was among five people considered for the vice-presidential slot of third-party presidential candidate [[George Wallace]]. However, in light of the public perception of both as segregationists, Wallace ended up selecting retired General [[Curtis LeMay]]. During the 1969 season, Faubus was hired by new owner Jess Odom to be general manager of his [[Li'l Abner]] theme park in the [[Ozark Mountains]], [[Dogpatch USA]]. According to newspaper articles, Faubus was said to have commented that managing the park was similar to running state government because some of the same tricks applied to both{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.\n\nFaubus sought the governorship again in 1970, 1974, and 1986 but was defeated in the Democratic primaries by [[Dale Bumpers]], [[David Pryor]], and [[Bill Clinton]], respectively, each of whom went on to defeat Republican opponents. In the 1970 race, two other Democratic candidates in the running, [[Joe Purcell]] and [[Hayes McClerkin]], failed to make the runoff, and Bumpers barely edged Purcell for the chance to face Faubus directly. In his last race, 1986, he polled 174,402 votes (33.5 percent) to Clinton's 315,397 (60.6 percent).\n\nFaubus' decline occurred when the Democrats reformed their own party in response to public acceptance of the progressive policies followed by Rockefeller. Thus, a new generation of popular Democratic candidates easily contrasted themselves favorably in voters' minds with Faubus' old-style politics and a more conservative Republican Party which followed Rockefeller's tenure in the state. In 1976, a report surfaced that Arkansas Republican leaders had approached Faubus about running for governor that year against Pryor, but both Faubus and the GOP denied the claim. The GOP instead ran the 40-year-old [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]] [[plumber]] Leon Griffith as its sacrificial lamb candidate against Pryor, who won the second of his two gubernatorial terms with more than 80 percent of the ballots.<ref>''Ripon Forum'', XII (June 15, 1976), p. 2</ref>\n\nFaubus died of [[prostate cancer]] on December 14, 1994, and is interred at the Combs Cemetery in Combs, Arkansas.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news| title=Orval Faubus, Segregation's Champion, Dies at 84| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/obituaries/orval-faubus-segregation-s-champion-dies-at-84.html| work=New York Times| author=Peter Applebome| date=15 December 1994| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n'''1954 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nFrancis Cherry (inc.) 47%\nOrval Faubus 34%\nGuy H. \"Mutt\" Jones 13%\nGus McMillan 6%\n\n'''1954 Democratic Primary Runoff for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus 51%\nFrancis Cherry 49%\n\n'''1954 General Election for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (D) 62%\nPratt Remmel (R) 38%\n\n'''1956 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (inc.) 58%\nJames D.

In 1957, he refused to comply with a unanimous decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the 1954 case ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', and ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to prevent black students from attending [[Little Rock Central High School]]. This event became known as the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nOrval Eugene Faubus was born in the northwest corner of Arkansas near the village of [[Combs, Arkansas|Combs]] to [[Sam Faubus|John Samuel]] and Addie ([[n\u00e9e]] Joslen) Faubus.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nFaubus's first political race was in 1936 when he contested a seat in the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]], which he lost. He was urged to challenge the result but declined, which earned him the gratitude of the Democratic Party. As a result, he was elected circuit clerk and recorder of Madison County, a post he held for two terms.<ref name=\"EAHC\">{{cite web| title=Oral Eugene Faubus (1910-1994)| work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas| date=22 September 2011| url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=102| \npublisher=Central Arkansas Library System| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\nWhen the United States entered [[World War II]], Faubus joined the United States Army and served as an intelligence officer with the [[US Third Army|Third Army]] of General [[George Patton]]. He rose to the rank of major and was in combat several times. His book, ''In This Faraway Land'', documents the military period of his life.  He was active in veterans' causes for the remainder of his life.\n\nWhen Faubus returned from the war, he cultivated ties with leaders of Arkansas' Democratic Party, particularly with progressive reform Governor [[Sid McMath]], leader of the post-war \"GI Revolt\" against corruption, under whom he served as director of the state's highway commission. Meanwhile, conservative Francis Cherry defeated McMath's bid for a third term in the 1952 Democratic primary. Cherry became unpopular with voters, and Faubus challenged him in the 1954 primary.\n\n==Gubernatorial election of 1954==\nIn the 1954 campaign, Faubus was compelled to defend his attendance at the defunct northwest Arkansas [[Commonwealth College, Arkansas|Commonwealth College]] in [[Mena, Arkansas|Mena]], as well as his early political upbringing. Commonwealth College had been formed by leftist academic and social activists, some of whom later were revealed to have had close ties with the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States of America]]. Most of those who attended and taught there were idealistic young people who sought an education or, in the case of the faculty, a job which came with room and board.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\">Reed (1997).</ref>\n\n===Democratic primary===\nDuring the runoff, Cherry and his surrogates accused Faubus of having attended a \"communist\" school and implied that his sympathies remained leftist. Faubus at first denied attending, and then admitted enrolling \"for only a few weeks\". Later, it was shown that he had remained at the school for more than a year, earned good grades, and was elected student body president. Faubus led a group of students who testified on behalf of the college's accreditation before the state legislature. Nevertheless, efforts to paint the candidate as a communist sympathizer backfired in a climate of growing resentment against such allegations. Faubus narrowly defeated Cherry to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.  Relations were cool between the two men for years, but when Cherry died in 1965, Faubus put politics aside and was magnanimous in praising his predecessor.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\n===General election===\nIn the 1954 [[general election]] campaign against Little Rock [[Mayor]] [[Pratt C. Remmel]], Faubus secured the endorsement of the previous 1950 and 1952 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] gubernatorial nominee, [[Jefferson W. Speck]], a planter from [[Mississippi County, Arkansas|Mississippi County]] in eastern Arkansas.<ref name=\"down\">{{cite book| title=Down from the Hills| author=Orval Faubus| publisher=Pioneer Press| year=1980| page=59}}</ref> Faubus defeated Remmel by a 63% to 37% percent margin. Remmel, a businessman and scion of a prominent Republican family, polled the strongest vote at the time for a GOP candidate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Faubus rejected his father's radicalism for the more mainline [[New Deal]], a pragmatic move. He was elected governor as a liberal Democrat. A moderate on racial issues, his political realism resurfaced as he adopted racial policies that were palatable to influential white voters in the [[Arkansas Delta|Delta]] region as part of a strategy to affect key social reforms and economic growth in Arkansas.<ref>Reed (2007)</ref>\n\n==Governor of Arkansas (1955-1967)==\nThe 1954 election made Faubus sensitive to attacks from the political right. It has been suggested that this sensitivity contributed to his later stance against integration when he was challenged by segregationist elements within his own party. He was known as a particularly effective one-on-one campaigner and was said to have never turned away anyone who sought to shake his hand, no matter how much time it took.\n\n==Little Rock crisis==\n{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}\n[[Image:Little Rock Nine protest.jpg|thumb|260px|Faubus speaking to a crowd protesting the integration of Little Rock schools]]\nFaubus' name became internationally known during the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]] of 1957, when he used the Arkansas National Guard to stop [[African Americans]] from attending Little Rock Central High School as part of federally ordered racial desegregation.\n\nCritics have long charged that Faubus' fight in Little Rock against the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] that separate schools were inherently unequal was politically motivated. The ensuing battle helped to shield him from the political fallout from the tax increase and to diminish Johnson's appeal. Journalist [[Harry Ashmore]] (who won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his columns on the subject) portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus. Ashmore said that Faubus used the Guard to keep blacks out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to arouse white voters.\n\nFaubus' decision led to a showdown with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and former Governor [[Sid McMath]]. On September 5, 1957, Eisenhower sent a telegram to Governor Orval E. Faubus in which he wrote \"The only assurance I can give you is that the Federal Constitution will be upheld by me by every legal means at my command.\" This was a response to Faubus' concerns about being taken into custody and his telephones being wired. Eisenhower did say in his telegram that the Department of Justice was collecting facts as to why there was a failure to comply with the courts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Press_release_DDE_telegram_to_Faubus.pdf|title=The President Today Sent the Following Telegram to the Honorable Oral E. Faubus, The Governor of Arkansas|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This sparked the September 14, 1957 conference where Faubus and Eisenhower discussed the Court order in Newport, Rhode Island. The quoted \"friendly and constructive discussion\" led to the Governor claiming his desire to comply with his duty to the Constitution, personal opinions aside. The Governor did express his hope that the Department of Justice would be patient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/Statements_by_DDE_and_Faubus.pdf|title=Press Release of Statement by the President and Governor Faubus|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 14, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The Arkansas Governor did stay true to his word and on September 21, 1957 President Eisenhower released a statement which announced that the Governor withdrew his troops, the Little Rock School Board was carrying out desegregation plans, and local law was ready to keep order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_21_Statement_by_President.pdf|title=Press Release; Statement by the President|last=Hagerty|first=James|date=September 21, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> On September 23, 1957, however, Mayor Woodrow Wilson Mann sent a telegram to Dwight Eisenhower stating a mob had formed at Central High School in Little Rock. State Police made efforts to control the mob, but for the safety of the newly enrolled children, they were sent home. The Mayor stressed how this was a planned act and that the principal agitator, Jimmy Karam, was an associate of Governor Faubus. The Mayor further explained how there was no way the Governor could not have been aware of this planned attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/civil_rights_little_rock/1957_09_23_Mann_to_DDE.pdf|title=Telegram from Mayor Mann to Eisenhower|last=Mann|first=Woodrow|date=September 23, 1957|website=Eisenhower Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In October 1957, Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and ordered them to return to their armories which effectively removed them from Faubus' control. Eisenhower then sent elements of the [[101st Airborne Division]] to Arkansas to protect the black students and enforce the Federal court order. The Arkansas National Guard later took over protection duties from the 101st Airborne Division. In retaliation, Faubus shut down Little Rock high schools for the 1958\u20131959 school year. This is often referred to as \"The Lost Year\" in Little Rock.<ref>Freyer (2007)</ref> In a 1985 interview with a Huntsville Arkansas student, Faubus stated that the Crisis was due to an \"Usurpation of power\" by the Federal Government. The State knew forced integration by the Federal Government was going to meet with unfavorable results from the Little Rock public. In his opinion, he was acting in his State's best interest at the time.\n\nThough Faubus later lost general popularity as a result of his stand against desegregation, at the time he was included among the \"Ten Men in the World Most Admired by Americans\", according to [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] for 1958. This dichotomy was later summed up as follows: Faubus was both the \"best loved\" and \"most hated\" of Arkansas politicians of the second half of the twentieth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Faubus-style politics===\nFaubus was elected governor to six two-year terms and hence served for twelve years. He maintained a defiant, populist image, while he shifted toward a less confrontational stance with the federal government, particularly during the administrations of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], with each of whom he remained cordial, and both of whom carried Arkansas.\n\nIn the 1956 general election, Faubus, having already eliminated Jim Johnson, overwhelmed GOP candidate Roy Mitchell, later the GOP state chairman from [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]],  321,797 (80.7%) to 77,215 (19.4%). In 1958, he defeated Republican George W. Johnson of [[Greenwood, Arkansas|Greenwood]] in Sebastian County by drawing 82.5% of the votes.\n\nIn 1960, Faubus defeated [[Attorney General]] [[Bruce Bennett (Arkansas politician)|Bruce Bennett]] in the Democratic gubernatorial primary for and then crushed the Republican choice, [[Henry M. Britt]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]] from Hot Springs, to secure reelection. Faubus polled 292,064 votes (69.2%) to Britt's 129,921 (30.8%). In the presidential election contest, however, Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] won Arkansas over the Republican [[Richard M. Nixon]] by less than expected. Britt was later a circuit judge in [[Garland County, Arkansas|Garland County]] from 1967 to 1983.\n\nIn 1962, Faubus broke with the [[White Citizens' Council]]s and other groups, who preferred, but did not officially endorse, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Dale Alford]] in that year's gubernatorial primary.<ref>{{cite book| first=Neil R| last=McMillen | title=The Citizens' Council: Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction 1954\u201364| publisher=University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-252-06441-8| page=285}}</ref> Faubus cast himself as a moderate, he completely ignored the race issue during the 1962 election campaign, and barely secured a majority over Alford, McMath, and three other candidates. He then handily defeated the Republican Willis Ricketts, a then 37-year-old pharmacist from [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] in the general election.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nWhile Faubus was still an outcast from black leaders, he nevertheless won a large percent of the black vote. In 1964, when he defeated the Republican [[Winthrop Rockefeller]] by a 57-43 percent margin, Faubus secured 81 percent of the black vote. He even collected a share of the base Republican vote from the conservative party members who had sided with former Republican state chairman [[William L. Spicer]] of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], an intraparty rival of Rockefeller.\n\n==Presidential election of 1960==\nDuring the 1960 presidential election, at a secret meeting held in a rural lodge near Dayton, Ohio, the [[National States Rights Party]] (NSRP) nominated Orval Faubus for President and retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral [[John G. Crommelin]] of Alabama for Vice President. Faubus, however, did not campaign on this ticket actively, and won only 0.07% of the vote (best in his native Arkansas: 6.76%), losing to the [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ticket.\n\n==Later life==\nFaubus chose not to run for re-election to a seventh term in what would likely have been a difficult race in 1966. Former gubernatorial candidate [[James D. Johnson]], by then an elected [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] Justice, narrowly won the Democratic nomination over another justice, the moderate Frank Holt. Johnson was then defeated in the general election by Winthrop Rockefeller, who became the state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction.  Years later, Johnson himself became a Republican and supported Governor [[Frank D. White]], later a benefactor of Faubus.<ref name = \"Reed 1997\" />\n\nIn [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], Faubus was among five people considered for the vice-presidential slot of third-party presidential candidate [[George Wallace]]. However, in light of the public perception of both as segregationists, Wallace ended up selecting retired General [[Curtis LeMay]]. During the 1969 season, Faubus was hired by new owner Jess Odom to be general manager of his [[Li'l Abner]] theme park in the [[Ozark Mountains]], [[Dogpatch USA]]. According to newspaper articles, Faubus was said to have commented that managing the park was similar to running state government because some of the same tricks applied to both{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.\n\nFaubus sought the governorship again in 1970, 1974, and 1986 but was defeated in the Democratic primaries by [[Dale Bumpers]], [[David Pryor]], and [[Bill Clinton]], respectively, each of whom went on to defeat Republican opponents. In the 1970 race, two other Democratic candidates in the running, [[Joe Purcell]] and [[Hayes McClerkin]], failed to make the runoff, and Bumpers barely edged Purcell for the chance to face Faubus directly. In his last race, 1986, he polled 174,402 votes (33.5 percent) to Clinton's 315,397 (60.6 percent).\n\nFaubus' decline occurred when the Democrats reformed their own party in response to public acceptance of the progressive policies followed by Rockefeller. Thus, a new generation of popular Democratic candidates easily contrasted themselves favorably in voters' minds with Faubus' old-style politics and a more conservative Republican Party which followed Rockefeller's tenure in the state. In 1976, a report surfaced that Arkansas Republican leaders had approached Faubus about running for governor that year against Pryor, but both Faubus and the GOP denied the claim. The GOP instead ran the 40-year-old [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]] [[plumber]] Leon Griffith as its sacrificial lamb candidate against Pryor, who won the second of his two gubernatorial terms with more than 80 percent of the ballots.<ref>''Ripon Forum'', XII (June 15, 1976), p. 2</ref>\n\nFaubus died of [[prostate cancer]] on December 14, 1994, and is interred at the Combs Cemetery in Combs, Arkansas.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news| title=Orval Faubus, Segregation's Champion, Dies at 84| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/obituaries/orval-faubus-segregation-s-champion-dies-at-84.html| work=New York Times| author=Peter Applebome| date=15 December 1994| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Electoral history==\n'''1954 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nFrancis Cherry (inc.) 47%\nOrval Faubus 34%\nGuy H. \"Mutt\" Jones 13%\nGus McMillan 6%\n\n'''1954 Democratic Primary Runoff for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus 51%\nFrancis Cherry 49%\n\n'''1954 General Election for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (D) 62%\nPratt Remmel (R) 38%\n\n'''1956 Democratic Primary for Governor'''\nOrval Faubus (inc.) 58%\nJames D.

The song was released as the sixth and final single worldwide on November 4, 1996, but was not released in the United States until July 7, 1997 by [[Epic Records]].<ref name=\"In\"/> The track was written by Jackson in September 1993, while on the [[Dangerous World Tour]] stop in Moscow. An early version of the track appears in the video game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]];'' according to conflicting accounts, Jackson and his team composed music for the game before leaving the project. Jackson wrote the lyrics as a poem before adapting them for the song.\n\nThe song's [[music video]] depicts the lives of six individuals, including Jackson, who are left isolated and disconnected from the world around them. This is Jackson's lowest charting song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 91, though it charted highly in the top 10 of numerous countries worldwide, including Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The song was performed on the [[HIStory World Tour]] in 1996\u20131997. It was covered a few times by other artists.\n\n==Background==\n\"Stranger in Moscow\", like several other ''HIStory'' tracks, was Jackson's response to recent events in his personal life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkerton|first=Lee|title=The Many Faces of Michael Jackson |publisher=Music Sales Distribution |year=1998 |page=34 |isbn=0-7119-6783-0}}</ref> In 1993, the relationship between Jackson and the press soured entirely when he was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse]]. Although he was not charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 42\u201345</ref> and headlines that implied guilt,<ref name=\"tara 500-507\" /> accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity and leaked police material for money,<ref name = \"campbell 77-80\">Campbell (1995), p. 77\u201380</ref><ref>Campbell (1995), p. 47\u201350</ref> deliberately using unflattering pictures of Jackson,<ref name = \"tara 500-507\">Taraborrelli, p. 500\u2013507</ref> and a lack of objectivity.<ref name = \"tara 500-507\"/>\n\nThe coverage upset Jackson, and damaged his health; Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his [[Dangerous World Tour|''Dangerous'' World Tour]] and went into rehabilitation.<ref name=\"campbell 89-93\">Campbell (1995), p. 89\u201393</ref><ref name=\"tara 524-528\">Taraborrelli, p. 524\u2013528</ref> The media showed the singer little sympathy. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' held a \"Spot the Jacko\" contest, offering readers a trip to [[Walt Disney World]] if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next.<ref name=\"campbell 89-93\" /> A ''[[Daily Express]]'' headline read, \"Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run\", while a ''[[News of the World]]'' headline accused Jackson of being a [[fugitive]]. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have [[cosmetic surgery]] that would make him unrecognizable on his return.<ref name=\"campbell 89-93\" /> [[Geraldo Rivera]] set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nOriginally, ''HIStory'' was planned as a greatest hits album, with a few new tracks. However, Jackson and his collaborators were so pleased with the result of \"Stranger in Moscow\" that they decided to give ''HIStory'' a full studio album as the second disc.<ref name=\"mjvisionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html|title=MJ visionary|publisher=Sony BMG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061311/http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html|archivedate=April 8, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref>\n\n\"Stranger in Moscow\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]],<ref name=\"HIStory review NYT\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=17:1471108 |title=Stranger In Moscow |website=Allmusic |access-date=2008-11-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603090016/http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg |archive-date=June 3, 2009 }}</ref> written by Jackson in 1993 during his [[Dangerous World Tour]] stop in Moscow.

Five of the figures are: a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed man feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a street game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allnaijaentertainment.com/2018/11/music-michael-jackson-stranger-moscow/|title=[Music] Michael Jackson \u2013 Stranger In Moscow|first=The|last=Terrorist!|date=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the citizens try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six \"strangers\" watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually, they decide to go outside, where they look up at the sky and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair.

Randy Taraborrelli, has stated that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even at the peak of his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, \"Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.\"<ref name=\"Associated press on HIStory lyrics a decade on\"/><ref>Taraborrelli, p. 206</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe song was performed during [[HIStory World Tour]] (1996-1997). It was also slated to be performed in the \"[[This Is It (concert residency)|This Is It]]\" concerts in London, which was scheduled to run from July 2009 to March 2010. On selected nights, \"Stranger in Moscow\" was going to be performed instead of \"Human Nature\".

The song was released as the sixth and final single worldwide on November 4, 1996, but was not released in the United States until July 7, 1997 by [[Epic Records]].<ref name=\"In\"/> The track was written by Jackson in September 1993, while on the [[Dangerous World Tour]] stop in Moscow. An early version of the track appears in the video game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]];'' according to conflicting accounts, Jackson and his team composed music for the game before leaving the project. Jackson wrote the lyrics as a poem before adapting them for the song.\n\nThe song's [[music video]] depicts the lives of six individuals, including Jackson, who are left isolated and disconnected from the world around them. This is Jackson's lowest charting song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 91, though it charted highly in the top 10 of numerous countries worldwide, including Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The song was performed on the [[HIStory World Tour]] in 1996\u20131997. It was covered a few times by other artists.\n\n==Background==\n\"Stranger in Moscow\", like several other ''HIStory'' tracks, was Jackson's response to recent events in his personal life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkerton|first=Lee|title=The Many Faces of Michael Jackson |publisher=Music Sales Distribution |year=1998 |page=34 |isbn=0-7119-6783-0}}</ref> In 1993, the relationship between Jackson and the press soured entirely when he was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse]]. Although he was not charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 42\u201345</ref> and headlines that implied guilt,<ref name=\"tara 500-507\" /> accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity and leaked police material for money,<ref name = \"campbell 77-80\">Campbell (1995), p. 77\u201380</ref><ref>Campbell (1995), p. 47\u201350</ref> deliberately using unflattering pictures of Jackson,<ref name = \"tara 500-507\">Taraborrelli, p. 500\u2013507</ref> and a lack of objectivity.<ref name = \"tara 500-507\"/>\n\nThe coverage upset Jackson, and damaged his health; Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his [[Dangerous World Tour|''Dangerous'' World Tour]] and went into rehabilitation.<ref name=\"campbell 89-93\">Campbell (1995), p. 89\u201393</ref><ref name=\"tara 524-528\">Taraborrelli, p. 524\u2013528</ref> The media showed the singer little sympathy. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' held a \"Spot the Jacko\" contest, offering readers a trip to [[Walt Disney World]] if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next.<ref name=\"campbell 89-93\" /> A ''[[Daily Express]]'' headline read, \"Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run\", while a ''[[News of the World]]'' headline accused Jackson of being a [[fugitive]]. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have [[cosmetic surgery]] that would make him unrecognizable on his return.<ref name=\"campbell 89-93\" /> [[Geraldo Rivera]] set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nOriginally, ''HIStory'' was planned as a greatest hits album, with a few new tracks. However, Jackson and his collaborators were so pleased with the result of \"Stranger in Moscow\" that they decided to give ''HIStory'' a full studio album as the second disc.<ref name=\"mjvisionary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html|title=MJ visionary|publisher=Sony BMG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061311/http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html|archivedate=April 8, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref>\n\n\"Stranger in Moscow\" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]],<ref name=\"HIStory review NYT\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=17:1471108 |title=Stranger In Moscow |website=Allmusic |access-date=2008-11-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603090016/http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg |archive-date=June 3, 2009 }}</ref> written by Jackson in 1993 during his [[Dangerous World Tour]] stop in Moscow.

Five of the figures are: a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed man feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a street game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allnaijaentertainment.com/2018/11/music-michael-jackson-stranger-moscow/|title=[Music] Michael Jackson \u2013 Stranger In Moscow|first=The|last=Terrorist!|date=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the scenario, heavy rain descends on the city and the citizens try to flee, all again seen in slow motion. From the safety of shelter, the six \"strangers\" watch everyone's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather. Eventually, they decide to go outside, where they look up at the sky and allow the rain to soak them. The video ends with Michael whipping his hair.

Randy Taraborrelli, has stated that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even at the peak of his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, \"Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.\"<ref name=\"Associated press on HIStory lyrics a decade on\"/><ref>Taraborrelli, p. 206</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\nThe song was performed during [[HIStory World Tour]] (1996-1997).

On selected nights, \"Stranger in Moscow\" was going to be performed instead of \"Human Nature\".

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited Brad said he added some melodies but Jackson decided not to use them in the final project. \n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]].

It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. Players can control Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like helicopter rotor;<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> when he tires, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.<ref name=\"m89\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|zones]],<ref name=\"m1617\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> each divided into two acts.

It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.
