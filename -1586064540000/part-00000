Two stockmen known as \"the Beardies\" because of their long beards took Boyd to this area to establish his run. \u2018The Beardies\u2019 later introduced other squatters to the best runs in the area to become known as the Land of the Beardies or Beardie Plains.<ref name=\"RD\">Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Readers Digest, Sydney.</ref>\n \nFurracabad Station was suggested by [[John James Galloway]] as an alternative to [[Wellingrove, New South Wales|Wellingrove]] for a new town. However Furracabad Station was sold in the 1840s depression and passed to Major [[Archibald Clunes Innes]], then to the [[Bank of Australasia]], then to John Major, who sold it to [[Archibald Mosman]]. The name Glen Innes is believed to be bestowed by Mosman in honour of Innes. Glen Innes was gazetted as a town in 1852 and the first lots were sold in 1854.<ref name=\"RD\"/> The post office was established in August 1854 and the court in 1858 when they replaced the [[Wellingrove, New South Wales|Wellingrove]] offices.<ref name=GlenInnesPO>{{cite web|title=Post Office List|url=https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=NSW&country=|publisher=Premier Postal Auctions|accessdate=23 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819030343/https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=NSW&country=|archive-date=19 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1866 the population was about 350, with a telegraph station, lands office, police barracks, courthouse, post office and two hotels.<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald, J.

In 1875, the population had swelled to about 1,500 and the town had a two teacher school, three churches, five hotels, two weekly newspapers, seven stores and a variety of societies and associations.<ref name=\"Donald\"/> On 19 August 1884 the new [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North railway]] from Sydney opened.<ref>'''''The Great Northern Railway - Uralla to Glen Innes''''' Cameron, Bill [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], July, 2002 pp258-265</ref> The arrival of the rail service and the expansion of mining contributed a new prosperity in the town, which is reflected in some of the beautiful buildings there.\n\nThe centre of the town retains some of its [[federation]] buildings and the owners have painted these buildings in the traditional colours. Many of these buildings have been placed on the [[Register of the National Estate]].\n\nThe town boasts a railway station that was once part of the [[Main North Line, New South Wales|Main North Line]].

Sapphires are mined in the creek valleys immediately west of town, and while tin is no longer commercially mined, mineral exploration is ongoing. The town holds regular [[livestock]] sales in the local saleyards. The town contains all of the regular service industries required by the community. Notable individual businesses include a [[photographic processing]] facility, an exporter of waste material balers, a large cattle feedlot, and transport depots. Sawmilling was historically a major industry of the district, but is now only conducted on a reasonable scale by the local minimum-security prison. The conversion of State Forests into National Parks has led to tourism becoming an important employer.\n\n==Climate==\nGlen Innes is 1,062 metres [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]] with an average annual rainfall of 857 mm.

Two stockmen known as \"the Beardies\" because of their long beards took Boyd to this area to establish his run. \u2018The Beardies\u2019 later introduced other squatters to the best runs in the area to become known as the Land of the Beardies or Beardie Plains.<ref name=\"RD\">Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Readers Digest, Sydney.</ref>\n \nFurracabad Station was suggested by [[John James Galloway]] as an alternative to [[Wellingrove, New South Wales|Wellingrove]] for a new town. However Furracabad Station was sold in the 1840s depression and passed to Major [[Archibald Clunes Innes]], then to the [[Bank of Australasia]], then to John Major, who sold it to [[Archibald Mosman]]. The name Glen Innes is believed to be bestowed by Mosman in honour of Innes. Glen Innes was gazetted as a town in 1852 and the first lots were sold in 1854.<ref name=\"RD\"/> The post office was established in August 1854 and the court in 1858 when they replaced the [[Wellingrove, New South Wales|Wellingrove]] offices.<ref name=GlenInnesPO>{{cite web|title=Post Office List|url=https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=NSW&country=|publisher=Premier Postal Auctions|accessdate=23 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819030343/https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=NSW&country=|archive-date=19 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1866 the population was about 350, with a telegraph station, lands office, police barracks, courthouse, post office and two hotels.<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald, J.

In 1875, the population had swelled to about 1,500 and the town had a two teacher school, three churches, five hotels, two weekly newspapers, seven stores and a variety of societies and associations.<ref name=\"Donald\"/> On 19 August 1884 the new [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North railway]] from Sydney opened.<ref>'''''The Great Northern Railway - Uralla to Glen Innes''''' Cameron, Bill [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], July, 2002 pp258-265</ref> The arrival of the rail service and the expansion of mining contributed a new prosperity in the town, which is reflected in some of the beautiful buildings there.\n\nThe centre of the town retains some of its [[federation]] buildings and the owners have painted these buildings in the traditional colours. Many of these buildings have been placed on the [[Register of the National Estate]].\n\nThe town boasts a railway station that was once part of the [[Main North Line, New South Wales|Main North Line]]. These days the line is closed at this point so the station is not in use.

Sapphires are mined in the creek valleys immediately west of town, and while tin is no longer commercially mined, mineral exploration is ongoing. The town holds regular [[livestock]] sales in the local saleyards. The town contains all of the regular service industries required by the community. Notable individual businesses include a [[photographic processing]] facility, an exporter of waste material balers, a large cattle feedlot, and transport depots. Sawmilling was historically a major industry of the district, but is now only conducted on a reasonable scale by the local minimum-security prison. The conversion of State Forests into National Parks has led to tourism becoming an important employer.\n\n==Climate==\nGlen Innes is 1,062 metres [[Australian Height Datum|AHD]] with an average annual rainfall of 857 mm.

These include two Olympians (Debbie Wells and David Cooper), Rugby League players Reg O'Keefe and John Ferguson, pistol shooters Bruce Favell and Robert Landers, veteran athlete Neville McIntyre and Andrew McIntyre in the sport of tentpegging.\n\nLike all communities in rural Australia, Glen Innes made a solid contribution to the wars. Two of the more highly decorated armed servicemen that still have family in the district were Peter Turnbull and [[Charles Curnow Scherf]]. Another major contributor to the wars from Glen Innes was [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kinsella-edward-parnell-ted-10748 Edward (Ted) Kinsella] who was a soldier and army official who was stationed in Greece, Gallipoli and France. \n\n[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kay-william-elphinstone-6901 William Elphinstone Kay] was Glen Innes number one surgeon and was a high up Army Medical Officer.\n\n==Glen Innes and Scotland==\n[[Archibald Clunes Innes]], from [[Thrumster]], [[Caithness]] was a captain in the Third Regiment (Buffs), when he arrived in Australia in 1822 on the Eliza in charge of 170 convicts. He held a number of New England properties including Glen Innes Station and Dundee station.\n\nGlen Innes has a number of street signs in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (though no residents speak of that language). There is also a \"[[Crofting|Crofter]]\"'s cottage.\n\nThe Australian Standing Stones are based on the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in [[Orkney]] (a non-Gaelic speaking area) or [[Calanais]] in [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]].\n\n[[Pitlochry]] is Glen Innes' [[Town twinning|twin town]] in Scotland.\n\nOther towns nearby with Scottish names include [[Armidale]], [[Ben Lomond, New South Wales|Ben Lomond]] and Glencoe. The name of nearby [[Inverell]] is also of [[Scottish Gaelic]] origin, meaning \"meeting place of the swans\" in reference to the black swans once typically seen on the [[Macintyre River]].\n\n==Twin towns==\nGlen Innes has [[Town twinning|twin town]] status with [[Pitlochry]] in [[Scotland]], and [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]] in [[Sydney]].\n\n==Wind farm==\nGlen Innes will soon<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Festive Season|url=http://www.whiterockwindfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/advertorial-15-December.pdf|website=White Rock Wind Farm|date=15 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://gleninneswindfarm.com.au/about-glen-innes/| title=About Glen Innes wind farm| website=Glen Innes wind farm}}</ref> be home to a new turbine wind farm (White Rock Wind farm) which the New South Wales Government has approved 23&nbsp;km west of the town.<ref>[http://www.gisc.nsw.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=3809&Itemid=3849 Glen Innes Severn Council]</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.epuron.com.au/project/white-rock/| title=White Rock Wind Farm| website=Epuron}}</ref>\nThere will be 70 turbines standing 150 metres high planned as Stage 1 and will be part of a $400 million project.

The highest hill is [[Mount Beerwah]] at 556 metres above sea level, but the most identifiable of all the hills is [[Mount Tibrogargan]] which from certain angles bears a resemblance to a face staring east towards the ocean. The Glass House Mountains are located near [[Beerburrum State Forest]] and Steve Irwin Way. From Brisbane, the mountains can be reached by following the Bruce Highway north and taking the Glass House Mountains tourist drive turn-off onto Steve Irwin Way. The trip is about one hour from Brisbane. The Volcanic peaks of the Glass House Mountains rise dramatically from the surrounding Sunshine Coast landscape. They were formed by intrusive plugs, remnants of volcanic activity that occurred 26-27 million years ago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=B. E.|last2=Vasconcelos|first2=P.

The highest hill is [[Mount Beerwah]] at 556 metres above sea level, but the most identifiable of all the hills is [[Mount Tibrogargan]] which from certain angles bears a resemblance to a face staring east towards the ocean. The Glass House Mountains are located near [[Beerburrum State Forest]] and Steve Irwin Way. From Brisbane, the mountains can be reached by following the Bruce Highway north and taking the Glass House Mountains tourist drive turn-off onto Steve Irwin Way. The trip is about one hour from Brisbane. The Volcanic peaks of the Glass House Mountains rise dramatically from the surrounding Sunshine Coast landscape. They were formed by intrusive plugs, remnants of volcanic activity that occurred 26-27 million years ago<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=B. E.|last2=Vasconcelos|first2=P.
