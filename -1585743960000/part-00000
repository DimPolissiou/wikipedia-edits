The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. Maedi  Visna virus is also referred to as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP).  This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi in a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna  refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis  in adult sheep.  This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems.  Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved.  Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lamontagne | first1 = L. | last2 = Roy | first2 = R. | last3 = Girard | first3 = A. | last4 = Samagh | first4 = B.

The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. Maedi  Visna virus is also referred to as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP).  This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi in a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna  refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis  in adult sheep.  This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems.  Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved.  Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lamontagne | first1 = L. | last2 = Roy | first2 = R. | last3 = Girard | first3 = A. | last4 = Samagh | first4 = B.

In the early 19th century Massachusetts took the lead in [[education reform]] and [[public education]] with programs designed by [[Horace Mann]] that were widely emulated across the North. Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught [[the three Rs]] (of reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most places. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the cities began building high schools. The South was far behind northern standards on every educational measure and gave weak support to its segregated all-black schools. However northern philanthropy and northern churches provided assistance to private black colleges across the South. Religious denominations across the country set up their private colleges. States also opened state universities, but they were quite small until well into the 20th century.\n\nIn 1823, the Reverend [[Samuel Read Hall]] founded the first [[normal school]], the Columbian School in [[Concord, Vermont]],<ref>[http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html Samuel Read Hall Biography at the Old Stone House Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405231650/http://www.oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html |date=April 5, 2010 }}, Retrieved on July 3, 2009</ref><ref name=\"melrosemirror.media.mit.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920192639/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 20, 2006 |title=An early Yankee Educator |publisher=Melrosemirror.media.mit.edu |date=April 1, 2005 |access-date=January 16, 2014 }}</ref> aimed at improving the quality of the burgeoning common school system by producing more qualified teachers.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the rapidly increasing Catholic population led to the formation of [[parochial schools]] in the largest cities. Theologically oriented Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Jewish bodies on a smaller scale set up their own parochial schools. There were debates over whether tax money could be used to support them, with the answer typically being no. From about 1876, thirty-nine states passed a constitutional amendment to their state constitutions, called [[Blaine Amendments]] after [[James G. Blaine]], one of their chief promoters, forbidding the use of public tax money to fund local parochial schools.\n\nStates passed laws to make [[Compulsory education|schooling compulsory]] between 1852 ([[Massachusetts]]) and 1917 ([[Mississippi]]). They also used federal funding designated by the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]]s of 1862 and 1890 to set up [[land grant colleges]] specializing in agriculture and engineering. By 1870, every state had free elementary schools,<ref>Paul Monroe, ''\"A cyclopedia of education\"'' (4 vol. 1911) covers each state</ref> albeit only in urban centers. According to a 2018 study in the ''[[The Economic Journal|Economic Journal]]'', states were more likely to adopt compulsory education laws during the Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131914) if they hosted more European immigrants with lower exposure to civic values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bandiera|first=Oriana|last2=Mohnen|first2=Myra|last3=Rasul|first3=Imran|last4=Viarengo|first4=Martina|date=2018-06-09|title=Nation-Building Through Compulsory Schooling During the Age of Mass Migration|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=129|issue=617|pages=62\u2013109|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12624|issn=0013-0133|url=http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/eopp/eopp57.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Reconstruction the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute]] was founded in 1881 as a state college, in [[Tuskegee]], Alabama, to train \"Colored Teachers,\" led by [[Booker T.

His movement spread, leading many other Southern states to establish small colleges for \"Colored or Negro\" students entitled \"A. & M.\" (\"Agricultural and Mechanical\") or \"A. & T.\" (\"Agricultural and Technical\"), some of which later developed into state universities. Before the 1940s, there were very few black students at private or state colleges in the North, and almost none in the South.<ref>Walter R., Allen, Edgar G. Epps, and Nesha Z.

The response was to cut education budgets. Obama's $800&nbsp;billion stimulus package included $100&nbsp;billion for public schools, which every state used to protect its education budget. In terms of sponsoring innovation, however, Obama and his Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] pursued K-12 education reform through the [[Race to the Top]] grant program. With over $15&nbsp;billion of grants at stake, 34 states quickly revised their education laws according to the proposals of advanced educational reformers. In the competition, points were awarded for allowing charter schools to multiply, for compensating teachers on a merit basis including student test scores, and for adopting higher educational standards. There were incentives for states to establish college and career-ready standards, which in practice meant adopting the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] that had been developed on a bipartisan basis by the [[National Governors Association]], and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]]. The criteria were not mandatory, they were incentives to improve opportunities to get a grant. Most states revised their laws accordingly, even though they realized it was unlikely they would win a highly competitive new grant. Race to the Top had strong bipartisan support, with centrist elements from both parties. It was opposed by the left wing of the Democratic Party, and by the right wing of the Republican Party, and criticized for centralizing too much power in Washington.

Most children enter the public education system around ages five or six. Children are assigned into year groups known as grades.\n\nThe American school year traditionally begins at the end of August or early in September, after a traditional [[summer vacation]] or break. Children customarily advance together from one grade to the next as a single cohort or \"class\" upon reaching the end of each school year in late May or early June.\n\nDepending upon their circumstances, children may begin school in [[pre-kindergarten]], kindergarten or first grade. Students normally attend 12 grades of study over 12 calendar years of primary/elementary and secondary education before graduating and earning a diploma that makes them eligible for admission to higher education. Education is mandatory until age 16 (18 in some states).\n\nIn the U.S., [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] (e.g., first grade) are used for identifying grades. Typical ages and grade groupings in contemporary, public and private schools may be found through the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. Generally there are three stages: elementary school (K\u20135th/6th grade), middle school (6th/7th\u20138th grades) and high school (9th\u201312th grades).<ref>[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-structure-us.html Structure of U.S. Education], U.S. Network for Education Information: U.S. Department of Education.

One method involves placing students in a grade based on a child's birthday. Cut off dates based on the child's birthday determine placement in either a higher or lower grade level.

[[Pre-kindergarten]] (also called '''Pre-K''' or '''PK''') is the preschool year immediately before Kindergarten. Preschool education may be delivered through a [[preschool]]. The [[Head Start (program)|Head Start program]], the federally funded early childhood education program for low-income children and their families founded in 1965 prepares children, especially those of a disadvantaged population, to better succeed in school. However, limited seats are available to students aspiring to take part in the [[Head Start program]]. Many community-based programs, commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations, faith communities, and independent childcare providers offer preschool education. Preschool may be general or may have a particular focus, such as arts education, religious education, sports training, or foreign language learning, along with providing general education.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In the United States, Preschool and Pre-K programs are not required, however they are encouraged by educators. Only 69 percent of 4-year-old American children are enrolled in early childhood development programs. Preschool age ranges anywhere from 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 years old. Pre-Kindergarten age ranges from 4 to 5 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthorizons.com/family-resources/e-family-news/preschool-vs-pre-kindergarten-what-is-the-difference|title=Preschool vs. Pre-Kindergarten: What's the Difference?|website=www.brighthorizons.com|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref> Pre-kindergarten is focused on preparing kindergarten readiness, which includes activities of deeper learning and more structured skill building. The curriculum for the day will consist of music, art, pretend play, science, reading, math, and other social activities. Both preschool as well as pre-k programs emphasize on inquiry base learning, however pre-k dives deeper into preparing kindergarten readiness.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2013/05/02/62054/the-united-states-is-far-behind-other-countries-on-pre-k/|title=The United States Is Far Behind Other Countries on Pre-K \u2013 Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n\n===Primary education===\n{{Main|Primary education in the United States}}\n[[File:School-education-learning-1750587-h.jpg|thumb|A teacher and her students in an elementary school classroom]]\nHistorically, in the United States, local public control (and private alternatives) have allowed for some variation in the organization of schools. [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary school]] includes kindergarten through [[sixth grade]] (or sometimes, to [[fourth grade]], [[fifth grade]] or [[eighth grade]]). Basic subjects are taught in elementary school, and students often remain in one classroom throughout the school day, except for specialized programs, such as [[physical education]], [[library]], [[music]], and [[art]] classes. There are (as of 2001) about 3.6&nbsp;million children in each grade in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2001 |access-date=April 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTypically, the curriculum in public elementary education is determined by individual [[school districts]] or county school system. The school district selects curriculum guides and textbooks that reflect a state's learning standards and benchmarks for a given grade level. The most recent curriculum that has been adopted by most states is Common Core.<ref name=\"isbe.state.il.us\">{{cite web |url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/ |title=Illinois State Board of Education \u2013 Illinois Learning Standards |publisher=Isbe.state.il.us |access-date=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414014841/http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/ |archive-date=April 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Learning Standards are the goals by which states and school districts must meet adequate yearly progress (AYP) as mandated by [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB). This description of school governance is simplistic at best, however, and school systems vary widely not only in the way curricular decisions are made but also in how teaching and learning take place. Some states or school districts impose more top-down mandates than others. In others, teachers play a significant role in curriculum design and there are few top-down mandates. Curricular decisions within private schools are often made differently from in public schools, and in most cases without consideration of NCLB.\n\nPublic elementary school teachers typically instruct between twenty and thirty students. A typical classroom will include children with a range of learning needs or abilities, from those identified as having special needs of the kinds listed in the Individuals with Disabilities Act [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] to those that are cognitively, athletically or artistically disabled. At times, an individual school district identifies areas of need within the curriculum. Teachers and advisory administrators form committees to develop supplemental materials to support learning for diverse learners and to identify enrichment for textbooks. There are special education teachers working with the identified students.  Many school districts post information about the curriculum and supplemental materials on websites for public access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://district.d303.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022626/http://www.d303.org/learnteach/curriculum.htm|url-status=dead|title=St. Charles Community Unit School District 303|archivedate=September 28, 2007|website=district.d303.org}}</ref>\n\nIn general, a student learns basic [[arithmetic]] and sometimes rudimentary algebra in [[mathematics]], English proficiency (such as basic [[English grammar|grammar]], [[English spelling|spelling]], and [[vocabulary]]), and fundamentals of other subjects. Learning standards are identified for all areas of a curriculum by individual States, including those for mathematics, social studies, science, physical development, the fine arts, and reading.<ref name=\"isbe.state.il.us\"/> While the concept of State Learning standards has been around for some time, [[No Child Left Behind]] has mandated that standards exist at the State level.\n\n===Secondary education===\n[[File:Calhan High School Senior Classroom by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A high-school senior (twelfth grade) classroom in [[Calhan, Colorado]]]]\n{{Main|Secondary education in the United States}}\nSecondary education is often divided into two phases, [[Middle school|middle/junior high school]] and [[High school (North America)|high school]]. Students are usually given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, and being allowed to choose some of their class subjects (electives).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n\"Middle school\" (or \"junior high school\") has a variable range between districts. It usually includes seventh and eighth grades and occasionally also includes one or more of the sixth, ninth, and very occasionally fifth grades as well. High school (occasionally senior high school) includes grades 9 through 12. Students in these grades are commonly referred to as freshmen (grade 9), sophomores (grade 10), juniors (grade 11) and seniors (grade 12). At the high school level, students generally take a broad variety of classes without specializing in any particular subject, with the exception of [[vocational schools]]. Students are generally required to take a broad range of mandatory subjects, but may choose additional subjects (\"electives\") to fill out their required hours of learning. High school grades normally are included in a student's official transcript, e.g. for college admission.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nEach state sets minimum requirements for how many years of various mandatory subjects are required; these requirements vary widely, but generally include 2\u20134 years of each of: Science, Mathematics, English, Social sciences, Physical education; some years of a foreign language and some form of art education are often also required, as is a health curriculum in which students learn about [[anatomy]], [[nutrition]], [[first aid]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[drug awareness]], and [[birth control]]. In many cases, however, options are provided for students to \"test out\" of this requirement or complete independent study to meet it.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMany high schools provide Honors, [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) courses. These are special forms of honors classes where the [[curriculum]] is more challenging and lessons more aggressively paced than standard courses. Honors, AP or IB courses are usually taken during the 11th or 12th grade of high school, but may be taken as early as 9th grade. Some international schools offer international school leaving qualifications, to be studied for and awarded instead of or alongside of the high school diploma, Honors, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate. Regular honors courses are more intense and faster paced than typical college preparatory courses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} AP and IB on the other hand, are college-level classes.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n====Tracking (streaming)====\n{{See also|Tracking (education)}}\n\nTracking is the practice of dividing students at the primary or secondary school level into classes on the basis of ability or achievement. One common use is to offer different curricula for students preparing for college and for those preparing for direct entry into technical schools or the workplace.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Grading scale===\nIn schools in the United States children are [[Academic grading in the United States|assessed]] throughout the school year by their teachers, and [[report card]]s are issued to parents at varying intervals. Generally the scores for individual assignments and tests are recorded for each student in a grade book, along with the maximum number of points for each assignment. End-of-term or -year evaluations are most frequently given in the form of a letter grade on an A-F scale, whereby A is the best possible grade and F is a failing grade (most schools do not include the letter E in the assessment scale), or a numeric percentage.

On December 10, 2015 President [[Barack Obama]] signed legislation replacing NCLB with the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] (ESSA).<ref name=\"Hirschfeld Davis\"/> However, the enactment of ESSA did not eliminate provisions relating to the periodic [[standardized tests]] given to students.<ref>{{cite news |last= Korte|first= Gregory|date=December 11, 2015|title= The Every Student Succeeds Act vs. No Child Left Behind: What's changed?|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/12/10/every-student-succeeds-act-vs-no-child-left-behind-whats-changed/77088780/|newspaper= USA Today|access-date= December 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Tim | date = December 9, 2015 | title = With Passage of Every Student Succeeds Act, Life After NCLB Begins | url = http://neatoday.org/2015/12/09/every-student-succeeds-act/ | newspaper = NEA Today | access-date = December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAcademic performance impacts the perception of a school's educational program. Rural schools fare better than their urban counterparts in two key areas: test scores and drop-out rate. First, students in small schools performed equal to or better than their larger school counterparts.<ref>Reynolds & Van Tuyle, 2012</ref>  In addition, on the 2005 National Assessment of Education Progress, 4th and 8th grade students scored as well or better in reading, science, and mathematics.<ref name=\"Rural Education, 2011\">Rural Education, 2011</ref>\n\nDuring high school, students (usually in [[Eleventh grade|11th grade]]) may take one or more standardized [[test (student assessment)|tests]] depending on their post-secondary education preferences and their local graduation requirements. In theory, these tests evaluate the overall level of knowledge and learning aptitude of the students. The [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] are the most common standardized tests that students take when applying to college. A student may take the SAT, ACT, both, or neither depending upon the [[higher education|post-secondary institutions]] the student plans to apply to for admission. Most competitive post-secondary institutions also require two or three [[SAT Subject Tests]] (formerly known as SAT IIs), which are shorter exams that focus strictly on a particular subject matter. However, all these tests serve little to no purpose for students who do not move on to post-secondary education, so they can usually be skipped without affecting one's ability to graduate.\n\nStandardized testing has become increasingly controversial in recent years. Creativity and the need for applicable knowledge are becoming rapidly more valuable than simple memorization.

Because a large portion of school revenues come from local property taxes, public schools vary widely in the resources they have available per student. Class size also varies from one district to another. Curriculum decisions in public schools are made largely at the local and state levels; the federal government has limited influence. In most districts, a locally elected school board runs schools. The school board appoints an official called the superintendent of schools to manage the schools in the district.\n\nLocal property taxes for public school funding may have disadvantages depending on how wealthy or poor these cities may be. Some of the disadvantages may be not having the proper electives of students interest or advanced placement courses to further the knowledge and education of these students. Cases such as these limit students and causes inequality in education because there is no easy way to gain access to those courses since the education system might not view them as necessary.

Private schools charge varying rates depending on geographic location, the school's expenses, and the availability of funding from sources, other than tuition. For example, some churches partially subsidize private schools for their members. Some people have argued that when their child attends a private school, they should be able to take the funds that the public school no longer needs and apply that money towards private school tuition in the form of [[School voucher|vouchers]]. This is the basis of the [[school choice]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n5,072,451 students attended 33,740 private elementary and secondary schools in 2007. 74.5% of these were Caucasian, non-Hispanic, 9.8% were African American, 9.6% were Hispanic. 5.4% were Asian or Pacific Islander, and .6% were American Indian<!---sic--->.

Some cater to families seeking a small school, with a nurturing, supportive environment. Unlike public school systems, private schools have no legal obligation to accept any interested student. Admission to some private schools is often highly selective. Private schools also have the ability to permanently expel persistently unruly students, a disciplinary option not legally available to public school systems.\n\nPrivate schools offer the advantages of smaller classes, under twenty students in a typical elementary classroom, for example; a higher teacher/student ratio across the school day, greater individualized attention and in the more competitive schools, [[expert]] college placement services. Unless specifically designed to do so, private schools usually cannot offer the services required by students with serious or multiple learning, emotional, or behavioral issues. Although reputed to pay lower salaries than public school systems, private schools often attract teachers by offering high-quality professional development opportunities, including tuition grants for advanced degrees. According to elite private schools themselves, this investment in faculty development helps maintain the high quality program that they offer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAn August 17, 2000 article by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' refers to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] Office of Catholic Schools as the largest private school system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000817/ai_n13867054 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-09-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194950/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000817/ai_n13867054 |archive-date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n====Charter schools====\n{{Main|Charter schools in the United States}}\n\nThe [[charter school]] movement began in 1990 and have spread rapidly in the United States, members, parents, teachers, and students to allow for the \"expression of diverse teaching philosophies and cultural and social life styles.\"<ref>Herbst, Juergen.

Universities in the United States are institutions that issue bachelor's, master's, professional, or doctorate degrees. Some universities offer programs at all degree levels from the associate to the doctorate, and are distinguished from community and junior colleges where the highest degree offered is the associate degree or a diploma. Though there is no prescribed definition of a \"university\" or \"college\" in the United States, universities are generally research-oriented institutions offering undergraduate, graduate, and [[professional degree|professional]] programs. American universities come in a variety of forms that serve different educational needs. Some [[Local governments in the United States|counties and cities]] have established and funded four-year institutions. Some of these institutions, such as the [[City University of New York]], are still operated by local governments. Others such as the [[University of Louisville]] and [[Wichita State University]] are now operated as state universities. Four-year institutions may be [[Public university|public]] or [[Private university|private]] colleges or universities. Private institutions are privately funded and there is a wide variety in size, focus, and operation. Some private institutions are large research universities, while others are small [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] that concentrate on undergraduate education. Some private universities are [[nonsectarian]] and [[secular]], while others are religiously-affiliated.\n\nAmong the United States' most prominent and world renowned institutions are large research universities that are ranked in such annual publications such as the ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'', ''[[QS World University Rankings]]'', ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities|ARWU]]'', by test preparation services such as ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' or by another university such as the Top American Research Universities ranked by the University of Florida's The Center.<ref name=\"thecenter\">{{cite web |url=http://thecenter.ufl.edu/research.html |title=The Top American Research Universities |access-date=November 7, 2006 |publisher=The Center (University of Florida) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031142155/http://thecenter.ufl.edu/research.html |archive-date=October 31, 2006 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> <!--<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/02/02/43e1c030461a5|title=Criticism unlikely to tarnish image|publisher=}}</ref> This link is no longer working. --> These rankings are based on factors such as [[brand recognition]], [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|number of Nobel Prize winners]], [[College admissions in the United States#How colleges evaluate applicants|selectivity in admissions]], generosity of alumni donors, and volume and quality of faculty research.

Community and junior colleges also offer trade school certifications for [[skilled trade]]s and [[Technician|technical]] careers.

There is a suspicion that student evaluation of adjuncts, along with their subsequent continued employment, can lead to [[grade inflation]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Clark, Kim |title = Does it Matter That Your Professor Is Part Time? | publisher = US News and World Report | date = November 17\u201324, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Credential inflation===\nEconomics professor Alan Zagier blames [[Academic inflation|credential inflation]] for the admission of so many unqualified students into college. He reports that the number of new jobs requiring college degrees is [[Higher education bubble in the United States|less than the number of college graduates]].<ref name=\"wp100606\" /> He states that the more money that a state spends on higher education, the slower the economy grows, the opposite of long held notions.<ref name=\"wp100606\" /> Other studies have shown that the level of cognitive achievement attained by students in a country (as measured by academic testing) is closely correlated with the country's economic growth, but that \"increasing the average number of years of schooling attained by the labor force boosts the economy only when increased levels of school attainment also boost cognitive skills.

Except for Hawaii, states delegate power to [[County (United States)|county]], [[city]] or [[township (United States)|township]]-level [[school board]]s that exercise control over a school district. Some school districts may further delegate significant authority to principals, such as those who have adopted the [[Portfolio strategy]].\n\nThe [[U.S. federal government]] exercises its control through the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. Education is not mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|constitution of the United States]], but the federal government uses the threat of decreased funding to enforce laws pertaining to education.<ref name=\"doe2\" /> Under recent administrations, initiatives such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] and [[Race to the Top]] have attempted to assert more central control in a heavily decentralized system.\n\n[[Nonprofit]] private schools are widespread, are largely independent of the government, and include secular as well as [[parochial school]]s.

The average funding by state governments increased by 120% per student. However, scores in mathematics, science and language arts over that same period remained almost unchanged. Multi-year periods in which a state's funding per student declined substantially also appear to have had little effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa746.pdf|title=State Education Trends: Academic Performance and Spending over the Past 40 Years|last=Coulson|first=Andrew|date=March 18, 2014|website=[[Cato Institute]]|publisher=|access-date=March 2, 2016|quote=}}</ref>\n\nProperty taxes as a primary source of funding for public education have become highly controversial, for a number of reasons. First, if a state's population and land values escalate rapidly, many longtime residents may find themselves paying property taxes much higher than anticipated. In response to this phenomenon, California's citizens passed [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] in 1978, which severely restricted the ability of the Legislature to expand the state's educational system to keep up with growth. Some states, such as Michigan, have investigated or implemented alternative schemes for funding education that may sidestep the problems of funding based mainly on property taxes by providing funding based on sales or income tax. These schemes also have failings, negatively impacting funding in a slow economy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/voices/index.ssf/2008/05/a_tax_increase_for_michigan_sc.html|title=A tax increase for Michigan school funding is possible only if school districts cut costs, says Flint Journal columnist Peter Luke|last=Luke|first=Peter|date=May 27, 2008|work=The Flint Journal|access-date=2008-06-12|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080531230920/http://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/voices/index.ssf/2008/05/a_tax_increase_for_michigan_sc.html|archive-date=May 31, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOne of the biggest debates in funding public schools is funding by local taxes or state taxes. The federal government supplies around 8.5% of the public school system funds, according to a 2005 report by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]].{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubs/npefs03/tables.asp |title=Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary and Secondary Education, Table 1 |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=June 4, 2014}} The remaining split between state and local governments averages 48.7 percent from states and 42.8 percent from local sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubs/npefs03/tables.asp|title=Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary and Secondary Education, Table 1|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=June 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRural schools struggle with funding concerns. State funding sources often favor wealthier districts. The state establishes a minimum flat amount deemed \"adequate\" to educate a child based on equalized assessed value of property taxes. This favors wealthier districts with a much larger tax base. This, combined with the history of slow payment in the state, leaves rural districts searching for funds. Lack of funding leads to limited resources for teachers. Resources that directly relate to funding include access to high-speed internet, online learning programs and advanced course offerings.<ref name=\"Rural Education, 2011\"/> These resources can enhance a student's learning opportunities, but may not be available to everyone if a district cannot afford to offer specific programs. One study found that school districts spend less efficiently in areas in which they face little or no competition from other public schools, in large districts, and in areas in which residents are poor or less educated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2000/wp2000_04.pdf|title=''Using Market Valuation to Assess the Importance and Efficiency of Public School Spending'', Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|publisher=}}</ref> Some public schools are experimenting with recruiting teachers from developing countries in order to fill the teacher shortage, as U.S. citizens with college degrees are turning away from the demanding, low paid profession.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/05/arizona-teachers-filipino-schools-low-pay|title=The job Americans won't take: Arizona looks to Philippines to fill teacher shortage|last1=Greene Sterling|first1=Terry|date=September 5, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=September 5, 2018|last2=Joffe-Block|first2=Jude|location=}}</ref>\n\n====Judicial intervention====\nThe reliance on local funding sources has led to a long history of court challenges about how states fund their schools. These challenges have relied on interpretations of state constitutions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that school funding was not a matter of the U.S. Constitution ([[San Antonio independent school District v. Rodriguez]], 411 U.S. 1 (1973)). The state court cases, beginning with the California case of [[Serrano v. Priest]], 5 Cal.3d 584 (1971), were initially concerned with equity in funding, which was defined in terms of variations in spending across local school districts. More recently, state court cases have begun to consider what has been called 'adequacy.' These cases have questioned whether the total amount of spending was sufficient to meet state constitutional requirements. Perhaps the most famous adequacy case is [[Abbott v. Burke]], 100 N.J. 269, 495 A.2d 376 (1985), which has involved state court supervision over several decades and has led to some of the highest spending of any U.S. districts in the so-called [[Abbott districts]]. The background and results of these cases are analyzed in a book by [[Eric Hanushek]] and Alfred Lindseth.<ref>[[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Alfred A. Lindseth, ''Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses: Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0691130002}})</ref> That analysis concludes that funding differences are not closely related to student outcomes and thus that the outcomes of the court cases have not led to improved policies.\n\nIn McCleary v. Washington State (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/843627.opn.pdf|title=McCleary v.

Washington state had budgeted $18.2&nbsp;billion for education spending in the two-year fiscal period ending in July 2015. The state Supreme Court decided that this budget must be boosted by $3.3&nbsp;billion in total by July 2019. On September 11, 2014, the state Supreme Court found the legislature in contempt for failing to uphold a court order to come up with a plan to boost its education budget by billions of dollars over the next five years. The state had argued that it had adequately funded education and said diverting tax revenue could lead to shortfalls in other public services.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|last1=Cavaliere|first1=Victoria|title=Washington's Supreme Court holds state in contempt over education|journal=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/11/us-usa-washington-education-idUSKBN0H629R20140911|access-date=September 13, 2014|date=2014-09-11}}</ref>\n\n====Pensions====\nWhile the hiring of teachers for public schools is done at the local school district level, the pension funds for teachers are usually managed at the state level. Some states have significant deficits when future requirements for teacher pensions are examined. In 2014, these were projected deficits for various states: Illinois -$187 billion, Connecticut -$57 billion, Kentucky -$41 billion, Hawaii -$16.5 billion, and Louisiana -$45.6 billion. These deficits range from 184% to 318% of these states' annual total budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/21/public-pensions-in-perilous-straits/6684383/|title=Dire Straits for some state pensions|last=Racioppi|first=Dustin|date=March 23, 2014|work=|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=March 23, 2014|location=|pages=6B|id=}}</ref>\n\n===Funding for college===\nAt the college and university level student loan funding is split in half; half is managed by the Department of Education directly, called the [[Federal Direct Student Loan Program]] (FDSLP). The other half is managed by commercial entities such as banks, credit unions, and financial services firms such as [[Sallie Mae]], under the [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]] (FFELP). Some schools accept only FFELP loans; others accept only FDSLP. Still others accept both, and a few schools will not accept either, in which case students must seek out private alternatives for student loans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/Student_Loans.php|title=Student Loans|publisher=Grove City College|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716222149/http://www.gcc.edu/Student_Loans.php|archive-date=July 16, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nGrant funding is provided by the federal [[Pell Grant]] program.\n\n==Issues==\nMajor issues include assessment of proficiency versus growth, funding and legal protection of special education, and excessive student loan debt.\n\n===American education crisis===\nIt has been alleged, since the 1950s and especially in recent years, that American schooling is undergoing a crisis in which academic performance is behind other countries, such as Russia, Japan, or China, in core subjects. Congress passed the National Defense Education Act in 1958 in an attempt to rectify these problems, and a series of other legislative acts in later decades such as [[No Child Left Behind]].

The students obtained general knowledge (such as mathematics, chemistry, English composition, etc.) applicable to the high geographic and social mobility in the United States. The provision of the high schools accelerated with the rise of the second industrial revolution. The increase in white collar and skilled blue-collar work in manufacturing was reflected in the demand for high school education.\n\nIn the 21st century, the '''educational attainment''' of the US population is similar to that of many other industrialized countries with the vast majority of the population having completed secondary education and a rising number of college graduates that outnumber high school dropouts. As a whole, the population of the United States is becoming increasingly more educated.<ref name=\"US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2009\"/>\n\nPost-secondary education is valued very highly by American society and is one of the main determinants of [[Social class in the United States|class]] and [[Social class in the United States#Social status|status]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} As with [[Household income in the United States|income]], however, there are significant discrepancies in terms of race, age, household configuration and geography.<ref name=\"US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003|access-date=July 31, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1980s the number of educated Americans has continued to grow, but at a slower rate.

This school of thought argues that the origin of this \"wealth gap\" is the slavery and racism that made it extremely difficult for African-Americans to accumulate wealth for almost 100 years after slavery was abolished. A comparable history of discrimination created a similar gap between Hispanics and Whites. This results in many minority children being born into low socioeconomic backgrounds, which in turn affects educational opportunities.<ref>Singham, Mano. 2005.

Culturally-responsive curriculum attempts to break down the dominant cultural bias that often pervades curriculum and instruction. Similar to the [[Anti-bias curriculum|anti-bias approach]], culturally-responsive curriculum is intended to help students and teachers \"recognize the connections between ethnicity, gender, religion, and social class, and power, privilege, prestige, and opportunity.\" Culturally-responsive curriculum specifically responds to the cultural needs of students as learners in the classroom.\n\nA study by Howard in 2001, documents student's responses to culturally-responsive curriculum and teaching strategies. The study found that these methods had a positive effect on student engagement and effort in the classroom. These findings are consistent with the theoretical claims of culturally-responsive curriculum.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Tyrone C.|date=2001-06-01|title=Telling Their Side of the Story: African-American Students' Perceptions of Culturally Relevant Teaching|journal=The Urban Review|volume=33|issue=2|pages=131\u2013149|doi=10.1023/A:1010393224120|issn=0042-0972}}</ref>\n\nTeachers can gain in-depth understandings of their students' individual needs by engaging with parents, learning about culturally-specific ways of communicating and learning, and allowing students to direct their learning and to collaborate on assignments that are both culturally and socially relevant to them.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCulturally-responsive curriculum is also implemented at the level of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice teacher education]].

Teacher attention to content is also extremely important. For example, when trying to hold boy's attention teachers will often use examples that reference classically male roles, perpetuating a gender bias in content.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn addition to curriculum that recognizes that gender impacts all students and their learning, other gender-sensitive curriculum directly engages gender-diversity issues and topics. Some curricular approaches include integrating gender through story problems, writing prompts, readings, art assignments, research projects and guest lectures that foster spaces for students to articulate their own understandings and beliefs about gender.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.genderspectrum.org/resources/education-2/|title=Education|work=Gender Spectrum|access-date=2017-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=====LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum=====\nLGBTQ-inclusive curriculum is curriculum that includes positive representations of LGBTQ people, history, and events.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.glsen.org/educate/resources/creating-lgbt-inclusive-lessons|title=LGBT-Inclusive Curriculum Guide for Educators|website=GLSEN|access-date=2017-05-29}}</ref> LGBTQ curriculum also attempts to integrate these narratives without biasing the LGBTQ experience as a separate and fragmented from overarching social narratives and not as intersecting with ethnic, racial, and other forms of diversity that exist among LGBTQ individuals.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe purpose of LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum is to ensure that LGBTQ students feel properly represented in curriculum narratives and therefore safer coming to school and more comfortable discussing LGBTQ-related topics. A study by GLSEN examined the impact of LGBTQ-inclusive practices on LGBTQ student's perceptions of safety. They study found that LGBT students in inclusive school-settings were much less likely to feel unsafe because of their identities and more likely to perceive their peers as accepting and supportive.\n\nImplementation of LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum involves both curriculum decisions and harnessing teachable moments in the classroom.

Inclusion in the US education system refers to the approach to educating students with special needs in a mainstream classroom. This model involves cultivating a strong relationship between teacher and student, and between non-special needs students and special needs students. Like the other models of culturally-inclusive curriculum, ability-inclusive curriculum often involves collaboration, parental-involvement, the creation of a safe and welcoming environment, returning agency to the students over their learning, and fostering open discussion about individual differences and strengths.<ref>\"How to Support Special Needs Students\". PhdinSpecialEducation.com</ref>\n\nResearch generally demonstrates neutral or positive effects of inclusive education.

A study conducted by Dylan Conger on effects of grade placement on English learners found that schools are often rushed to make a decision on what grade an incoming student should be placed, so they base their decision on the child's birthday.<ref name=\":6\" /> Unfortunately, teachers and staff are not always able to test the child's knowledge to determine what grade level would be better for the students based on what they already know.<ref name=\":6\" /> This can cause some difficulties for immigrant students.

The purpose for these methods was to ensure that migrant students were better prepared to start school, but it did cause some issues for both the student and the teachers. The study found that even though older students placed in first grade classrooms were more obedient, the students had trouble connecting with their classmates and teacher had to address them differently due to their age.<ref name=\":8\" /> Thai public schools attempted to address this issue by some implementing a rule that a student could not be older than 9 to enroll, but this led to learning centers not given recommendations to public school for older students.<ref name=\":8\" /> More research is needed in order to better understand the effects of grade placement in immigrant students.\n\nWhile data supports the theory that English-language (EL) literacy interventions are beneficial for students of all grade levels and socioeconomic status, including disadvantaged immigrant students, poor implementation of EL instruction has contributed to downward assimilation and long-term or permanent Limited English Proficiency (LEP) status for many immigrant youths.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adesope|first=Olusola O.|last2=Lavin|first2=Tracy|last3=Thompson|first3=Terri|last4=Ungerleider|first4=Charles|date=2011-01-06|title=Pedagogical strategies for teaching literacy to ESL immigrant students: A meta-analysis|journal=British Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=81|issue=4|pages=629\u2013653|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8279.2010.02015.x|pmid=22050311|issn=0007-0998}}</ref> LEP status serves as a nonacademic factor for student course enrollment, negatively affecting immigrant student learning opportunities by separating English-learning from other coursework.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Callahan|first=Rebecca|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Lindsey|last3=Muller|first3=Chandra|last4=Frisco|first4=Michelle|date=2008-02-05|title=ESL Placement and Schools|journal=Educational Policy|volume=23|issue=2|pages=355\u2013384|doi=10.1177/0895904807310034|pmid=20617111|pmc=2898206|issn=0895-9048}}</ref> Focus on English literacy, and organizational constraints such as immigrant student population, may take away needed resources from challenging academic courses, such as math and science courses that are less English-dependent, thereby impeding LEP students\u2019 educational opportunities and post-secondary education preparation.\n\n===School to prison pipeline===\nThe [[school-to-prison pipeline]] (SPP) is the disproportionate tendency of minors and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds to become incarcerated, because of increasingly harsh school and municipal policies.

In the early 19th century Massachusetts took the lead in [[education reform]] and [[public education]] with programs designed by [[Horace Mann]] that were widely emulated across the North. Teachers were specially trained in normal schools and taught [[the three Rs]] (of reading, writing, and arithmetic) and also history and geography. Public education was at the elementary level in most places. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the cities began building high schools. The South was far behind northern standards on every educational measure and gave weak support to its segregated all-black schools. However northern philanthropy and northern churches provided assistance to private black colleges across the South. Religious denominations across the country set up their private colleges. States also opened state universities, but they were quite small until well into the 20th century.\n\nIn 1823, the Reverend [[Samuel Read Hall]] founded the first [[normal school]], the Columbian School in [[Concord, Vermont]],<ref>[http://oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html Samuel Read Hall Biography at the Old Stone House Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405231650/http://www.oldstonehousemuseum.org/srhallbio.html |date=April 5, 2010 }}, Retrieved on July 3, 2009</ref><ref name=\"melrosemirror.media.mit.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920192639/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353130353631 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 20, 2006 |title=An early Yankee Educator |publisher=Melrosemirror.media.mit.edu |date=April 1, 2005 |access-date=January 16, 2014 }}</ref> aimed at improving the quality of the burgeoning common school system by producing more qualified teachers.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the rapidly increasing Catholic population led to the formation of [[parochial schools]] in the largest cities. Theologically oriented Episcopalian, Lutheran, and Jewish bodies on a smaller scale set up their own parochial schools. There were debates over whether tax money could be used to support them, with the answer typically being no. From about 1876, thirty-nine states passed a constitutional amendment to their state constitutions, called [[Blaine Amendments]] after [[James G. Blaine]], one of their chief promoters, forbidding the use of public tax money to fund local parochial schools.\n\nStates passed laws to make [[Compulsory education|schooling compulsory]] between 1852 ([[Massachusetts]]) and 1917 ([[Mississippi]]). They also used federal funding designated by the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]]s of 1862 and 1890 to set up [[land grant colleges]] specializing in agriculture and engineering. By 1870, every state had free elementary schools,<ref>Paul Monroe, ''\"A cyclopedia of education\"'' (4 vol. 1911) covers each state</ref> albeit only in urban centers. According to a 2018 study in the ''[[The Economic Journal|Economic Journal]]'', states were more likely to adopt compulsory education laws during the Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131914) if they hosted more European immigrants with lower exposure to civic values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bandiera|first=Oriana|last2=Mohnen|first2=Myra|last3=Rasul|first3=Imran|last4=Viarengo|first4=Martina|date=2018-06-09|title=Nation-Building Through Compulsory Schooling During the Age of Mass Migration|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=129|issue=617|pages=62\u2013109|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12624|issn=0013-0133|url=http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/eopp/eopp57.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Reconstruction the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute]] was founded in 1881 as a state college, in [[Tuskegee]], Alabama, to train \"Colored Teachers,\" led by [[Booker T.

His movement spread, leading many other Southern states to establish small colleges for \"Colored or Negro\" students entitled \"A. & M.\" (\"Agricultural and Mechanical\") or \"A. & T.\" (\"Agricultural and Technical\"), some of which later developed into state universities. Before the 1940s, there were very few black students at private or state colleges in the North, and almost none in the South.<ref>Walter R., Allen, Edgar G. Epps, and Nesha Z.

The 1983 [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]] report, famously titled ''[[A Nation at Risk]]'', touched off a wave of local, state, and federal reform efforts, but by 1990 the country still spent only 2 percent of its budget on education, compared with 30 percent on support for the elderly.<ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = U.S. spending|last = |first = |date = April 19, 1990|work = [[Rolling Stone]]|access-date = |via = |page = 43}}</ref> In 1990, the EHA was replaced with the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), which placed more focus on students as individuals, and also provided for more post-high school transition services.\n\n===21st century===\nThe 2002 [[No Child Left Behind Act]], passed by a bipartisan coalition in Congress provided federal aid to the states in exchange for measures to penalize schools that were not meeting the goals as measured by standardized state exams in mathematics and language skills.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jesse Rhodes|title=An Education in Politics: The Origins and Evolution of No Child Left Behind|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fDvg6r8oHKIC&pg=PA179|year=2012|publisher=Cornell U.P.|pages=179\u201381|isbn=978-0801464669}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Steven Brill|title=Class Warfare: Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_e6RjCtpcAC&pg=PA84|year=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=84|isbn=9781451611991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/factsheet.html|title=Archived: Fact Sheet on No Child Left Behind|publisher=|date=2006-05-03}}</ref> In the same year, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] diluted some of the century-old \"Blaine\" laws upheld an [[Ohio]] law allowing aid to [[parochial school]]s under specific circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=00-1751 |title=Zeman vs Simmon-Harris, US Supreme Court certoriari 00-1751 |date=June 27, 2002 |publisher=findlaw.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021002104112/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=00-1751 |archive-date=October 2, 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 2006 [[Commission on the Future of Higher Education]] evaluated higher education.

The response was to cut education budgets. Obama's $800&nbsp;billion stimulus package included $100&nbsp;billion for public schools, which every state used to protect its education budget. In terms of sponsoring innovation, however, Obama and his Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] pursued K-12 education reform through the [[Race to the Top]] grant program. With over $15&nbsp;billion of grants at stake, 34 states quickly revised their education laws according to the proposals of advanced educational reformers. In the competition, points were awarded for allowing charter schools to multiply, for compensating teachers on a merit basis including student test scores, and for adopting higher educational standards. There were incentives for states to establish college and career-ready standards, which in practice meant adopting the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] that had been developed on a bipartisan basis by the [[National Governors Association]], and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]]. The criteria were not mandatory, they were incentives to improve opportunities to get a grant. Most states revised their laws accordingly, even though they realized it was unlikely they would win a highly competitive new grant. Race to the Top had strong bipartisan support, with centrist elements from both parties. It was opposed by the left wing of the Democratic Party, and by the right wing of the Republican Party, and criticized for centralizing too much power in Washington. Complaints also came from middle-class families, who were annoyed at the increasing emphasis on teaching to the test, rather than encouraging teachers to show creativity and stimulating students' imagination.<ref>[[Jonathan Zimmerman]], \"Education in the Age of Obama: The Paradox of Consensus\" in Zelizer, ed., ''The Presidency of Barack Obama '' pp 110\u201328.</ref><ref>Patrick McGuinn, \"Stimulating reform: Race to the Top, competitive grants and the Obama education agenda.\" ''Educational Policy'' 26.1 (2012): 136\u2013159.</ref>\n\nIn the 2010s, [[student loan debt]] became recognized as a social problem.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/25/opinion/sunday/student-debt-loan-default-college.html |title = Opinion &#124; the Student Debt Problem is Worse Than We Imagined|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2018-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/economy-budget/309760-student-debt-is-americas-most-pressing-economic-problem |title = Student debt is America's most pressing economic problem|date = 2016-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-17/the-student-loan-debt-crisis-is-about-to-get-worse |title = The Student Loan Debt Crisis Is About to Get Worse |last=Griffin |first=Riley |date=2018-10-17 |work=Bloomberg}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/11/28/student-loan-debt-crisis/ | title=Betsy DeVos: Student Loan Debt is Now A 'Crisis'}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/student-loan-debt-crisis/ |title = Will a Student Loan Debt Crisis Sink the U.S. Economy?}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\nIn 2000, 76.6&nbsp;million students had enrolled in schools from [[Kindergarten#United States|kindergarten]] through graduate schools.

Most children enter the public education system around ages five or six. Children are assigned into year groups known as grades.\n\nThe American school year traditionally begins at the end of August or early in September, after a traditional [[summer vacation]] or break. Children customarily advance together from one grade to the next as a single cohort or \"class\" upon reaching the end of each school year in late May or early June.\n\nDepending upon their circumstances, children may begin school in [[pre-kindergarten]], kindergarten or first grade. Students normally attend 12 grades of study over 12 calendar years of primary/elementary and secondary education before graduating and earning a diploma that makes them eligible for admission to higher education. Education is mandatory until age 16 (18 in some states).\n\nIn the U.S., [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] (e.g., first grade) are used for identifying grades. Typical ages and grade groupings in contemporary, public and private schools may be found through the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. Generally there are three stages: elementary school (K\u20135th/6th grade), middle school (6th/7th\u20138th grades) and high school (9th\u201312th grades).<ref>[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/edlite-structure-us.html Structure of U.S. Education], U.S. Network for Education Information: U.S. Department of Education.

By the 1990s, most areas of the country had been released from [[Desegregation busing in the United States|mandatory busing]].\n\nSchool start times are computed with busing in mind. There are often three start times: for elementary, for middle/junior high school, and for high school. One school district computed its cost per bus (without the driver) at $20,575 annually. It assumed a model where the average driver drove 80 miles per day. A driver was presumed to cost $.62 per mile (1.6&nbsp;km). Elementary schools started at 7:30, middle schools/junior high school started at 8:30, and high schools at 8:15.

One method involves placing students in a grade based on a child's birthday. Cut off dates based on the child's birthday determine placement in either a higher or lower grade level. For example, if the school's cut off date is September 1, and an incoming student's birthday is August 2, then this student would be placed in a higher grade level.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Conger|first=Dylan|date=December 2013|title=The Effect of Grade Placement on English Language Learners' Academic Achievement|journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis|volume=35|issue=4|pages=395\u2013412|doi=10.3102/0162373713493315|issn=0162-3737}}</ref> If the student is in high school, this could mean that the student gets placed as a junior instead of a sophomore because of their birthday. If the student's birthday falls after the cut off date, such as November 1, then they would be placed in the lower grade, which in this example, would be a sophomore.\n\n===Preschool and pre-kindergarten===\n{{main|Pre-kindergarten}}\nPreschool refers to non-compulsory [[classroom]]-based early-childhood education. [[Pre-kindergarten]] (also called '''Pre-K''' or '''PK''') is the preschool year immediately before Kindergarten. Preschool education may be delivered through a [[preschool]]. The [[Head Start (program)|Head Start program]], the federally funded early childhood education program for low-income children and their families founded in 1965 prepares children, especially those of a disadvantaged population, to better succeed in school. However, limited seats are available to students aspiring to take part in the [[Head Start program]]. Many community-based programs, commercial enterprises, non-profit organizations, faith communities, and independent childcare providers offer preschool education. Preschool may be general or may have a particular focus, such as arts education, religious education, sports training, or foreign language learning, along with providing general education.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In the United States, Preschool and Pre-K programs are not required, however they are encouraged by educators. Only 69 percent of 4-year-old American children are enrolled in early childhood development programs. Preschool age ranges anywhere from 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 years old. Pre-Kindergarten age ranges from 4 to 5 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthorizons.com/family-resources/e-family-news/preschool-vs-pre-kindergarten-what-is-the-difference|title=Preschool vs. Pre-Kindergarten: What's the Difference?|website=www.brighthorizons.com|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref> Pre-kindergarten is focused on preparing kindergarten readiness, which includes activities of deeper learning and more structured skill building. The curriculum for the day will consist of music, art, pretend play, science, reading, math, and other social activities. Both preschool as well as pre-k programs emphasize on inquiry base learning, however pre-k dives deeper into preparing kindergarten readiness.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2013/05/02/62054/the-united-states-is-far-behind-other-countries-on-pre-k/|title=The United States Is Far Behind Other Countries on Pre-K \u2013 Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n\n===Primary education===\n{{Main|Primary education in the United States}}\n[[File:School-education-learning-1750587-h.jpg|thumb|A teacher and her students in an elementary school classroom]]\nHistorically, in the United States, local public control (and private alternatives) have allowed for some variation in the organization of schools. [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary school]] includes kindergarten through [[sixth grade]] (or sometimes, to [[fourth grade]], [[fifth grade]] or [[eighth grade]]). Basic subjects are taught in elementary school, and students often remain in one classroom throughout the school day, except for specialized programs, such as [[physical education]], [[library]], [[music]], and [[art]] classes. There are (as of 2001) about 3.6&nbsp;million children in each grade in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2001 |access-date=April 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTypically, the curriculum in public elementary education is determined by individual [[school districts]] or county school system. The school district selects curriculum guides and textbooks that reflect a state's learning standards and benchmarks for a given grade level. The most recent curriculum that has been adopted by most states is Common Core.<ref name=\"isbe.state.il.us\">{{cite web |url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/ |title=Illinois State Board of Education \u2013 Illinois Learning Standards |publisher=Isbe.state.il.us |access-date=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414014841/http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ils/ |archive-date=April 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Learning Standards are the goals by which states and school districts must meet adequate yearly progress (AYP) as mandated by [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB). This description of school governance is simplistic at best, however, and school systems vary widely not only in the way curricular decisions are made but also in how teaching and learning take place. Some states or school districts impose more top-down mandates than others. In others, teachers play a significant role in curriculum design and there are few top-down mandates. Curricular decisions within private schools are often made differently from in public schools, and in most cases without consideration of NCLB.\n\nPublic elementary school teachers typically instruct between twenty and thirty students. A typical classroom will include children with a range of learning needs or abilities, from those identified as having special needs of the kinds listed in the Individuals with Disabilities Act [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] to those that are cognitively, athletically or artistically disabled. At times, an individual school district identifies areas of need within the curriculum. Teachers and advisory administrators form committees to develop supplemental materials to support learning for diverse learners and to identify enrichment for textbooks. There are special education teachers working with the identified students.  Many school districts post information about the curriculum and supplemental materials on websites for public access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://district.d303.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928022626/http://www.d303.org/learnteach/curriculum.htm|url-status=dead|title=St. Charles Community Unit School District 303|archivedate=September 28, 2007|website=district.d303.org}}</ref>\n\nIn general, a student learns basic [[arithmetic]] and sometimes rudimentary algebra in [[mathematics]], English proficiency (such as basic [[English grammar|grammar]], [[English spelling|spelling]], and [[vocabulary]]), and fundamentals of other subjects. Learning standards are identified for all areas of a curriculum by individual States, including those for mathematics, social studies, science, physical development, the fine arts, and reading.<ref name=\"isbe.state.il.us\"/> While the concept of State Learning standards has been around for some time, [[No Child Left Behind]] has mandated that standards exist at the State level.\n\n===Secondary education===\n[[File:Calhan High School Senior Classroom by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A high-school senior (twelfth grade) classroom in [[Calhan, Colorado]]]]\n{{Main|Secondary education in the United States}}\nSecondary education is often divided into two phases, [[Middle school|middle/junior high school]] and [[High school (North America)|high school]]. Students are usually given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, and being allowed to choose some of their class subjects (electives).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n\"Middle school\" (or \"junior high school\") has a variable range between districts. It usually includes seventh and eighth grades and occasionally also includes one or more of the sixth, ninth, and very occasionally fifth grades as well. High school (occasionally senior high school) includes grades 9 through 12. Students in these grades are commonly referred to as freshmen (grade 9), sophomores (grade 10), juniors (grade 11) and seniors (grade 12). At the high school level, students generally take a broad variety of classes without specializing in any particular subject, with the exception of [[vocational schools]]. Students are generally required to take a broad range of mandatory subjects, but may choose additional subjects (\"electives\") to fill out their required hours of learning. High school grades normally are included in a student's official transcript, e.g. for college admission.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nEach state sets minimum requirements for how many years of various mandatory subjects are required; these requirements vary widely, but generally include 2\u20134 years of each of: Science, Mathematics, English, Social sciences, Physical education; some years of a foreign language and some form of art education are often also required, as is a health curriculum in which students learn about [[anatomy]], [[nutrition]], [[first aid]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[drug awareness]], and [[birth control]]. In many cases, however, options are provided for students to \"test out\" of this requirement or complete independent study to meet it.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMany high schools provide Honors, [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) courses. These are special forms of honors classes where the [[curriculum]] is more challenging and lessons more aggressively paced than standard courses. Honors, AP or IB courses are usually taken during the 11th or 12th grade of high school, but may be taken as early as 9th grade. Some international schools offer international school leaving qualifications, to be studied for and awarded instead of or alongside of the high school diploma, Honors, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate. Regular honors courses are more intense and faster paced than typical college preparatory courses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} AP and IB on the other hand, are college-level classes.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n====Tracking (streaming)====\n{{See also|Tracking (education)}}\n\nTracking is the practice of dividing students at the primary or secondary school level into classes on the basis of ability or achievement. One common use is to offer different curricula for students preparing for college and for those preparing for direct entry into technical schools or the workplace.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Grading scale===\nIn schools in the United States children are [[Academic grading in the United States|assessed]] throughout the school year by their teachers, and [[report card]]s are issued to parents at varying intervals. Generally the scores for individual assignments and tests are recorded for each student in a grade book, along with the maximum number of points for each assignment. End-of-term or -year evaluations are most frequently given in the form of a letter grade on an A-F scale, whereby A is the best possible grade and F is a failing grade (most schools do not include the letter E in the assessment scale), or a numeric percentage.

The act also required that students and schools show [[adequate yearly progress]]. This means they must show some improvement each year. When a student fails to make adequate yearly progress, NCLB mandated that remediation through summer school or tutoring be made available to a student in need of extra help. On December 10, 2015 President [[Barack Obama]] signed legislation replacing NCLB with the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]] (ESSA).<ref name=\"Hirschfeld Davis\"/> However, the enactment of ESSA did not eliminate provisions relating to the periodic [[standardized tests]] given to students.<ref>{{cite news |last= Korte|first= Gregory|date=December 11, 2015|title= The Every Student Succeeds Act vs. No Child Left Behind: What's changed?|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/12/10/every-student-succeeds-act-vs-no-child-left-behind-whats-changed/77088780/|newspaper= USA Today|access-date= December 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Tim | date = December 9, 2015 | title = With Passage of Every Student Succeeds Act, Life After NCLB Begins | url = http://neatoday.org/2015/12/09/every-student-succeeds-act/ | newspaper = NEA Today | access-date = December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAcademic performance impacts the perception of a school's educational program. Rural schools fare better than their urban counterparts in two key areas: test scores and drop-out rate. First, students in small schools performed equal to or better than their larger school counterparts.<ref>Reynolds & Van Tuyle, 2012</ref>  In addition, on the 2005 National Assessment of Education Progress, 4th and 8th grade students scored as well or better in reading, science, and mathematics.<ref name=\"Rural Education, 2011\">Rural Education, 2011</ref>\n\nDuring high school, students (usually in [[Eleventh grade|11th grade]]) may take one or more standardized [[test (student assessment)|tests]] depending on their post-secondary education preferences and their local graduation requirements. In theory, these tests evaluate the overall level of knowledge and learning aptitude of the students. The [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] are the most common standardized tests that students take when applying to college. A student may take the SAT, ACT, both, or neither depending upon the [[higher education|post-secondary institutions]] the student plans to apply to for admission. Most competitive post-secondary institutions also require two or three [[SAT Subject Tests]] (formerly known as SAT IIs), which are shorter exams that focus strictly on a particular subject matter. However, all these tests serve little to no purpose for students who do not move on to post-secondary education, so they can usually be skipped without affecting one's ability to graduate.\n\nStandardized testing has become increasingly controversial in recent years. Creativity and the need for applicable knowledge are becoming rapidly more valuable than simple memorization.

Because a large portion of school revenues come from local property taxes, public schools vary widely in the resources they have available per student. Class size also varies from one district to another. Curriculum decisions in public schools are made largely at the local and state levels; the federal government has limited influence. In most districts, a locally elected school board runs schools. The school board appoints an official called the superintendent of schools to manage the schools in the district.\n\nLocal property taxes for public school funding may have disadvantages depending on how wealthy or poor these cities may be. Some of the disadvantages may be not having the proper electives of students interest or advanced placement courses to further the knowledge and education of these students. Cases such as these limit students and causes inequality in education because there is no easy way to gain access to those courses since the education system might not view them as necessary. The public education system does provide the classes needed to obtain a GED (General Education Development) and obtain a job or pursue higher education.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Educational access and the state: Historical continuities and discontinuities in racial inequality in american education.

Admission to some private schools is often highly selective. Private schools also have the ability to permanently expel persistently unruly students, a disciplinary option not legally available to public school systems.\n\nPrivate schools offer the advantages of smaller classes, under twenty students in a typical elementary classroom, for example; a higher teacher/student ratio across the school day, greater individualized attention and in the more competitive schools, [[expert]] college placement services.

Universities in the United States are institutions that issue bachelor's, master's, professional, or doctorate degrees. Some universities offer programs at all degree levels from the associate to the doctorate, and are distinguished from community and junior colleges where the highest degree offered is the associate degree or a diploma.

American universities come in a variety of forms that serve different educational needs. Some [[Local governments in the United States|counties and cities]] have established and funded four-year institutions. Some of these institutions, such as the [[City University of New York]], are still operated by local governments. Others such as the [[University of Louisville]] and [[Wichita State University]] are now operated as state universities. Four-year institutions may be [[Public university|public]] or [[Private university|private]] colleges or universities. Private institutions are privately funded and there is a wide variety in size, focus, and operation. Some private institutions are large research universities, while others are small [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] that concentrate on undergraduate education.

Depending upon the type of school and program, annual graduate program tuition can vary from $15,000 to as high as $50,000. Note that these prices do not include living expenses (rent, room/board, etc.) or additional fees that schools add on such as \"activities fees\" or [[health insurance]]. These fees, especially room and board, can range from $6,000 to $12,000 per academic year (assuming a single student without children).<ref name=\"collegeboard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/press/article/0,3183,29541,00.html |title=Tuition Levels Rise but Many Students Pay Significantly Less than Published Rates |publisher=Collegeboard.com |access-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603184127/http://www.collegeboard.com/press/article/0%2C3183%2C29541%2C00.html |archive-date=June 3, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe mean annual total cost (including all costs associated with a full-time post-secondary schooling, such as tuition and fees, books and supplies, room and board), as reported by collegeboard.com for 2010:<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://press.collegeboard.org/college-pricing-student-aid |title=College Pricing and Student Aid \u2013 Pressroom |publisher=Press.collegeboard.org |date=April 9, 2013 |access-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n* Public university (4 years): $27,967 (per year)\n* Private university (4 years): $40,476 (per year)\n\nTotal, four-year schooling:\n\n* Public university: $111,868\n* Private university: $161,904\n\nCollege costs are rising at the same time that state appropriations for aid are shrinking.

Except for Hawaii, states delegate power to [[County (United States)|county]], [[city]] or [[township (United States)|township]]-level [[school board]]s that exercise control over a school district. Some school districts may further delegate significant authority to principals, such as those who have adopted the [[Portfolio strategy]].\n\nThe [[U.S. federal government]] exercises its control through the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. Education is not mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|constitution of the United States]], but the federal government uses the threat of decreased funding to enforce laws pertaining to education.<ref name=\"doe2\" /> Under recent administrations, initiatives such as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] and [[Race to the Top]] have attempted to assert more central control in a heavily decentralized system.\n\n[[Nonprofit]] private schools are widespread, are largely independent of the government, and include secular as well as [[parochial school]]s.

The average funding by state governments increased by 120% per student. However, scores in mathematics, science and language arts over that same period remained almost unchanged. Multi-year periods in which a state's funding per student declined substantially also appear to have had little effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa746.pdf|title=State Education Trends: Academic Performance and Spending over the Past 40 Years|last=Coulson|first=Andrew|date=March 18, 2014|website=[[Cato Institute]]|publisher=|access-date=March 2, 2016|quote=}}</ref>\n\nProperty taxes as a primary source of funding for public education have become highly controversial, for a number of reasons. First, if a state's population and land values escalate rapidly, many longtime residents may find themselves paying property taxes much higher than anticipated. In response to this phenomenon, California's citizens passed [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]] in 1978, which severely restricted the ability of the Legislature to expand the state's educational system to keep up with growth. Some states, such as Michigan, have investigated or implemented alternative schemes for funding education that may sidestep the problems of funding based mainly on property taxes by providing funding based on sales or income tax. These schemes also have failings, negatively impacting funding in a slow economy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/voices/index.ssf/2008/05/a_tax_increase_for_michigan_sc.html|title=A tax increase for Michigan school funding is possible only if school districts cut costs, says Flint Journal columnist Peter Luke|last=Luke|first=Peter|date=May 27, 2008|work=The Flint Journal|access-date=2008-06-12|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080531230920/http://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/voices/index.ssf/2008/05/a_tax_increase_for_michigan_sc.html|archive-date=May 31, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOne of the biggest debates in funding public schools is funding by local taxes or state taxes. The federal government supplies around 8.5% of the public school system funds, according to a 2005 report by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]].{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubs/npefs03/tables.asp |title=Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary and Secondary Education, Table 1 |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=June 4, 2014}} The remaining split between state and local governments averages 48.7 percent from states and 42.8 percent from local sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubs/npefs03/tables.asp|title=Revenues and Expenditures for Public Elementary and Secondary Education, Table 1|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=June 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRural schools struggle with funding concerns. State funding sources often favor wealthier districts. The state establishes a minimum flat amount deemed \"adequate\" to educate a child based on equalized assessed value of property taxes. This favors wealthier districts with a much larger tax base. This, combined with the history of slow payment in the state, leaves rural districts searching for funds. Lack of funding leads to limited resources for teachers. Resources that directly relate to funding include access to high-speed internet, online learning programs and advanced course offerings.<ref name=\"Rural Education, 2011\"/> These resources can enhance a student's learning opportunities, but may not be available to everyone if a district cannot afford to offer specific programs. One study found that school districts spend less efficiently in areas in which they face little or no competition from other public schools, in large districts, and in areas in which residents are poor or less educated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2000/wp2000_04.pdf|title=''Using Market Valuation to Assess the Importance and Efficiency of Public School Spending'', Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|publisher=}}</ref> Some public schools are experimenting with recruiting teachers from developing countries in order to fill the teacher shortage, as U.S. citizens with college degrees are turning away from the demanding, low paid profession.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/05/arizona-teachers-filipino-schools-low-pay|title=The job Americans won't take: Arizona looks to Philippines to fill teacher shortage|last1=Greene Sterling|first1=Terry|date=September 5, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=September 5, 2018|last2=Joffe-Block|first2=Jude|location=}}</ref>\n\n====Judicial intervention====\nThe reliance on local funding sources has led to a long history of court challenges about how states fund their schools. These challenges have relied on interpretations of state constitutions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that school funding was not a matter of the U.S. Constitution ([[San Antonio independent school District v. Rodriguez]], 411 U.S. 1 (1973)). The state court cases, beginning with the California case of [[Serrano v. Priest]], 5 Cal.3d 584 (1971), were initially concerned with equity in funding, which was defined in terms of variations in spending across local school districts. More recently, state court cases have begun to consider what has been called 'adequacy.' These cases have questioned whether the total amount of spending was sufficient to meet state constitutional requirements. Perhaps the most famous adequacy case is [[Abbott v. Burke]], 100 N.J. 269, 495 A.2d 376 (1985), which has involved state court supervision over several decades and has led to some of the highest spending of any U.S. districts in the so-called [[Abbott districts]]. The background and results of these cases are analyzed in a book by [[Eric Hanushek]] and Alfred Lindseth.<ref>[[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Alfred A. Lindseth, ''Schoolhouses, Courthouses, and Statehouses: Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0691130002}})</ref> That analysis concludes that funding differences are not closely related to student outcomes and thus that the outcomes of the court cases have not led to improved policies.\n\nIn McCleary v. Washington State (2012),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/843627.opn.pdf|title=McCleary v.

Washington state had budgeted $18.2&nbsp;billion for education spending in the two-year fiscal period ending in July 2015. The state Supreme Court decided that this budget must be boosted by $3.3&nbsp;billion in total by July 2019. On September 11, 2014, the state Supreme Court found the legislature in contempt for failing to uphold a court order to come up with a plan to boost its education budget by billions of dollars over the next five years. The state had argued that it had adequately funded education and said diverting tax revenue could lead to shortfalls in other public services.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|last1=Cavaliere|first1=Victoria|title=Washington's Supreme Court holds state in contempt over education|journal=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/11/us-usa-washington-education-idUSKBN0H629R20140911|access-date=September 13, 2014|date=2014-09-11}}</ref>\n\n====Pensions====\nWhile the hiring of teachers for public schools is done at the local school district level, the pension funds for teachers are usually managed at the state level. Some states have significant deficits when future requirements for teacher pensions are examined. In 2014, these were projected deficits for various states: Illinois -$187 billion, Connecticut -$57 billion, Kentucky -$41 billion, Hawaii -$16.5 billion, and Louisiana -$45.6 billion. These deficits range from 184% to 318% of these states' annual total budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/21/public-pensions-in-perilous-straits/6684383/|title=Dire Straits for some state pensions|last=Racioppi|first=Dustin|date=March 23, 2014|work=|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=March 23, 2014|location=|pages=6B|id=}}</ref>\n\n===Funding for college===\nAt the college and university level student loan funding is split in half; half is managed by the Department of Education directly, called the [[Federal Direct Student Loan Program]] (FDSLP). The other half is managed by commercial entities such as banks, credit unions, and financial services firms such as [[Sallie Mae]], under the [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]] (FFELP). Some schools accept only FFELP loans; others accept only FDSLP. Still others accept both, and a few schools will not accept either, in which case students must seek out private alternatives for student loans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/Student_Loans.php|title=Student Loans|publisher=Grove City College|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716222149/http://www.gcc.edu/Student_Loans.php|archive-date=July 16, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nGrant funding is provided by the federal [[Pell Grant]] program.\n\n==Issues==\nMajor issues include assessment of proficiency versus growth, funding and legal protection of special education, and excessive student loan debt.\n\n===American education crisis===\nIt has been alleged, since the 1950s and especially in recent years, that American schooling is undergoing a crisis in which academic performance is behind other countries, such as Russia, Japan, or China, in core subjects.

The students obtained general knowledge (such as mathematics, chemistry, English composition, etc.) applicable to the high geographic and social mobility in the United States. The provision of the high schools accelerated with the rise of the second industrial revolution. The increase in white collar and skilled blue-collar work in manufacturing was reflected in the demand for high school education.\n\nIn the 21st century, the '''educational attainment''' of the US population is similar to that of many other industrialized countries with the vast majority of the population having completed secondary education and a rising number of college graduates that outnumber high school dropouts. As a whole, the population of the United States is becoming increasingly more educated.<ref name=\"US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2009\"/>\n\nPost-secondary education is valued very highly by American society and is one of the main determinants of [[Social class in the United States|class]] and [[Social class in the United States#Social status|status]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} As with [[Household income in the United States|income]], however, there are significant discrepancies in terms of race, age, household configuration and geography.<ref name=\"US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003|access-date=July 31, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1980s the number of educated Americans has continued to grow, but at a slower rate. Some have attributed this to an increase in the foreign born portion of the workforce. However, the decreasing growth of the educational workforce has instead been primarily due to slowing down in educational attainment of people schooled in the United States.<ref>Goldin, C., Katz, L.F.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: 2008.</ref>\n\n====Remedial education in college====\nDespite high school graduates formally qualifying for college, only 4% of two-year and four-year colleges do not have any students in noncredit [[Remedial education|remedial courses]]. Over 200 colleges place most of their first-year students in one or more remedial courses. Almost 40% of students in remedial courses fail to complete them.

This is a turnaround from the early 20th century when boys usually outperformed girls. Boys have still been found to score higher on standardized tests than girls and go on to be better represented in the more prestigious, high-paying STEM fields. There is an ongoing debate over which gender is the most short-changed in the classroom.<ref name=\":4\" /> Parents and educators are concerned about how to motivate males to become better students.\n\n====Racial achievement differences====\n{{Further|Racial achievement gap in the United States|Race and intelligence|African-American family structure}}\n[[File:NAEP-reading-trends-race-2004.png|thumb|450px|[[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] reading long-term trends for ages 9 (light gray), 13 (dark gray), and 17 (black)]]\n\nThe racial achievement gap in the US refers to the educational disparities between Black and Hispanic students compared with Asian and Caucasian students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/20380.htm |title=Students Affected by Achievement Gaps |publisher=NEA |date=December 3, 2008 |access-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref> This disparity manifests itself in a variety of ways: African-American and Hispanic students are more likely to receive lower grades, score lower on standardized tests, drop out of high school, and are less likely to enter and complete college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/achievement-gap/ |title=Research Center: Achievement Gap |publisher=Edweek.org |access-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSeveral reasons have been suggested for these disparities.\n\nOne explanation is the disparity in income that exists between African Americans and Whites.  This school of thought argues that the origin of this \"wealth gap\" is the slavery and racism that made it extremely difficult for African-Americans to accumulate wealth for almost 100 years after slavery was abolished. A comparable history of discrimination created a similar gap between Hispanics and Whites. This results in many minority children being born into low socioeconomic backgrounds, which in turn affects educational opportunities.<ref>Singham, Mano. 2005. The Achievement Gap in U.S. Education: Canaries in the Mine. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield Education.</ref>\n\nAnother explanation has to do with family structure.  Professor [[Lino Graglia]] has suggested that Blacks and Hispanics are falling behind in education because they are increasingly [[African-American family structure|raised in single-parent families]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Kathleen | last=Parker | title=Reluctant First Father | url=| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=[[Melbourne, Florida]] | pages= 7A | date=December 13, 2012 | id= | access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/11/lino-graglia-affirmative-action_n_2278180.html |title=Lino Graglia, UT Law Professor, Decries Single Motherhood, Black Test Scores, And Affirmative Action (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=December 11, 2012 |access-date=February 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA third explanation which has been suggested, by, for example University of California, Berkeley Professor [[Arthur Jensen]], in [[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?|a controversial paper published in 1969]], is that there is an innate [[Race and intelligence|difference in intelligence between blacks and whites]].

(See [[visual system]]). For small angles, the size of this retinal image <math>R</math> is\n\n:<math>\\frac{R}{n} = \\tan V,</math>\n\nwhere <math>n</math> is the distance from the nodal points to the retina, about 17&nbsp;mm.\n\n==Examples==\nIf one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57\u00b0.  Thus they have the same retinal image size <math>R \\approx 0.17 \\text{ mm}</math>.\n\nThat is just a bit larger than the retinal image size for the moon, which is about <math>0.15 \\text{ mm}</math>, because, with moon's mean diameter <math>S = 3474\\text{ kilometers}</math> <math>(2159 \\text{ miles})</math> , and  earth to moon mean distance <math>D</math> averaging  <math>383,000 \\text{ kilometers}</math> (<math>238,000 \\text{ miles}</math>), <math>V \\approx 0.009 \\text{ rad}</math><math>\\approx 0.52 \\text{ deg}</math>.\n\nAlso, for some  easy observations, if one holds one's index finger at arm's length, the width of the index fingernail subtends approximately one degree, and the width of the thumb at the first joint subtends approximately two degrees.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = O'Shea | first = Robert P. | year = 1991 | title = Thumb's rule tested: Visual angle of thumb's width is about 2 deg | journal = [[Perception (journal)|Perception]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 415\u2013418 | doi = 10.1068/p200415 | url = http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p200415 | pmid=1762884}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, if one is interested in the performance of the eye or the first processing steps in the [[visual cortex]], it does not make sense to refer to the absolute size of a viewed object (its linear size <math>S</math>). What matters is the visual angle <math>V</math> which determines the size of the retinal image.\n\n==Terminological confusions==\nIn astronomy the term ''apparent size'' refers to the physical angle <math>V</math> or [[angular diameter]].\n\nBut in [[psychophysics]] and [[experimental psychology]] the adjective \"apparent\" refers to a person's subjective experience.\nSo, \"apparent size\" has  referred to how large an object looks, also often called its \"perceived size\".\n\nAdditional confusion has occurred because there are two qualitatively different \"size\" experiences for a viewed object.<ref>Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985, Baird, 1970</ref> One is the perceived  visual angle <math>V'</math> (or apparent visual angle) which is the subjective correlate of <math>V</math>, also called the object's perceived or apparent angular size.\nThe perceived  visual angle is best defined as the difference between the perceived directions of the object's endpoints from oneself.<ref>Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985</ref>\n\nThe other \"size\" experience  is the object's perceived linear size <math>S'</math> (or apparent linear size) which is the subjective correlate of <math>S</math>, the object's physical width or height or diameter.\n\nWidespread  use of the ambiguous  terms \"apparent size\" and \"perceived size\" without specifying the units of  measure has caused confusion.\n\n==Representation of visual angle in visual cortex==\nThe brain's [[primary visual cortex]] (area V1 or Brodmann area 17) contains a spatially [[isomorphic]] representation of the retina (see [[retinotopy]]).  Loosely speaking,  it is a distorted \"map\" of the retina. Accordingly, the size <math>R</math> of a given retinal image determines the extent of the neural activity pattern eventually generated in area V1 by the associated retinal activity pattern. Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten (2006) recently used [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]  (fMRI) to show that an increase in a viewed target's visual angle, which increases <math>R</math>, also increases the extent of the corresponding neural activity pattern in area V1.\n\nThe observers in Murray 'et al.'s' experiment viewed a flat picture with two discs that subtended the same visual angle <math>V</math> and formed retinal images of the same size <math>R</math>, but the perceived angular size <math>V'</math> of one was about 17% larger than for the other, due to differences in the background patterns for the disks. It was shown that the areas of the activity in V1 related to the disks were of unequal size, despite the fact that the retinal images were the same size.  This size difference in area V1 correlated with the 17% illusory difference between the perceived visual angles. This finding has implications for spatial illusions such as the [[visual angle illusion]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = An Analysis of the Experiment by Murray, S. O., Boyaci, H., & Kersten, D.

What matters is the visual angle <math>V</math> which determines the size of the retinal image.\n\n==Terminological confusions==\nIn astronomy the term ''apparent size'' refers to the physical angle <math>V</math> or [[angular diameter]].\n\nBut in [[psychophysics]] and [[experimental psychology]] the adjective \"apparent\" refers to a person's subjective experience.\nSo, \"apparent size\" has  referred to how large an object looks, also often called its \"perceived size\".\n\nAdditional confusion has occurred because there are two qualitatively different \"size\" experiences for a viewed object.<ref>Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985, Baird, 1970</ref> One is the perceived  visual angle <math>V'</math> (or apparent visual angle) which is the subjective correlate of <math>V</math>, also called the object's perceived or apparent angular size.\nThe perceived  visual angle is best defined as the difference between the perceived directions of the object's endpoints from oneself.<ref>Joynson, 1949, McCready, 1965, 1985</ref>\n\nThe other \"size\" experience  is the object's perceived linear size <math>S'</math> (or apparent linear size) which is the subjective correlate of <math>S</math>, the object's physical width or height or diameter.\n\nWidespread  use of the ambiguous  terms \"apparent size\" and \"perceived size\" without specifying the units of  measure has caused confusion.\n\n==Representation of visual angle in visual cortex==\nThe brain's [[primary visual cortex]] (area V1 or Brodmann area 17) contains a spatially [[isomorphic]] representation of the retina (see [[retinotopy]]).  Loosely speaking,  it is a distorted \"map\" of the retina. Accordingly, the size <math>R</math> of a given retinal image determines the extent of the neural activity pattern eventually generated in area V1 by the associated retinal activity pattern. Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten (2006) recently used [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]  (fMRI) to show that an increase in a viewed target's visual angle, which increases <math>R</math>, also increases the extent of the corresponding neural activity pattern in area V1.\n\nThe observers in Murray 'et al.'s' experiment viewed a flat picture with two discs that subtended the same visual angle <math>V</math> and formed retinal images of the same size <math>R</math>, but the perceived angular size <math>V'</math> of one was about 17% larger than for the other, due to differences in the background patterns for the disks. It was shown that the areas of the activity in V1 related to the disks were of unequal size, despite the fact that the retinal images were the same size.  This size difference in area V1 correlated with the 17% illusory difference between the perceived visual angles. This finding has implications for spatial illusions such as the [[visual angle illusion]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = An Analysis of the Experiment by Murray, S. O., Boyaci, H., & Kersten, D.
