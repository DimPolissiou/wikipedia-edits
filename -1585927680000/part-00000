The most widely used [[semiconductor device]] in electronic circuits is the [[MOSFET]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Golio |first1=Mike |last2=Golio |first2=Janet |title=RF and Microwave Passive and Active Technologies |date=2018 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9781420006728 |page=18-2<!-- hyphen (-) is the proper page designation --> |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCj9jxSVQKIC&pg=SA18-PA2}}</ref>\n\n[[Breadboard]]s, [[perfboard]]s, and [[stripboard]]s are common for testing new designs. They allow the designer to make quick changes to the circuit during development.\n\n==Analog circuits==\n{{Main|Analogue electronics}}\n[[File:Common Base amplifier.png|thumb|A [[circuit diagram]] representing an analog circuit, in this case a simple amplifier]] \n\n[[analog electronics|Analog electronic circuits]] are those in which current or [[voltage]] may vary continuously with time to correspond to the information being represented. Analog circuitry is constructed from two fundamental building blocks: [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] and [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] circuits.\n\nIn a series circuit, the same current passes through a series of components. A string of Christmas lights is a good example of a series circuit: if one goes out, they all do.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, all the components are connected to the same voltage, and the current divides between the various components according to their resistance.\n\n[[File:Simple electrical schematic with Ohms law.png|right|thumb|width200| A simple schematic showing wires, a resistor, and a battery]]\n\nThe basic components of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s. (In 2012 it was demonstrated that [[memristor]]s can be added to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in [[schematic diagram]]s, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a [[field-effect transistor]] can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.\n\nAn alternative model is to take independent power sources and [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent [[Negative resistance|negative resistors]], [[gyrator]]s, [[negative impedance converter]]s, and [[dependent source]]s as secondary electronic components.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nWhen the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the [[distributed-element model]].  Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant [[characteristic impedance]], and the [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.  Circuits designed according to this approach are [[distributed-element circuit]]s. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.\n\n==Digital circuits==\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\n\nIn [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuits]], electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values.<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Digital Logic Design|author=John Hayes|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1993}}</ref> These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'.  Digital circuits make extensive use of [[transistor]]s, interconnected to create [[logic gate]]s that provide the functions of [[Boolean logic]]: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and combinations thereof.  Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input.  Digital circuits therefore can provide logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions.  (Memory based on [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] is known as [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).  Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) is also widely used.)\n\nThe design process for digital circuits is fundamentally different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design.  As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost.  Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers.  As digital circuits become more complex, issues of time delay, [[race condition|logic races]], power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to circuit density, speed and performance. \n\nDigital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as [[microprocessor]]s, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development. <!-- and to be done through it -->\n\n==Mixed-signal circuits==\n{{main | Mixed-signal integrated circuit }}\n\nMixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits.  Examples include [[comparator]]s, [[timers]], [[phase-locked loop]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.  Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits.  For example, in a receiver,  analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic circuit design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electronic circuits}}\n* [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/ Electronics Circuits Textbook]\n* [http://www.rohm.com/web/global/en_index/ Electronics Fundamentals]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Circuit}}\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic circuits| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n\n[[es:Circuito electr\u00f3nico]]\n[[hu:\u00c1ramk\u00f6r]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:153056995 5ef8b01016 o.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] from an [[Intel]] 8742, an 8-bit [[microcontroller]] that includes a [[CPU]], 128 [[byte]]s of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] \"data\" on current chip.]]\n[[File:PExdcr01CJC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A circuit built on a printed circuit board (PCB).]]\n\nAn '''electronic circuit''' is composed of individual [[electronic component]]s, such as [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[diode]]s, connected by conductive [[wire]]s or [[Conductive trace|traces]] through which [[electric current]] can flow.

In an [[integrated circuit]] or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a [[semiconductor]] such as doped [[silicon]] or (less commonly) [[gallium arsenide]].<ref name=\"Jaeger\">{{cite journal|title=Microelectronic Circuit Design|author=Richard Jaeger|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nAn electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an [[analog circuit]], a [[digital circuit]], or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits). The most widely used [[semiconductor device]] in electronic circuits is the [[MOSFET]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Golio |first1=Mike |last2=Golio |first2=Janet |title=RF and Microwave Passive and Active Technologies |date=2018 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9781420006728 |page=18-2<!-- hyphen (-) is the proper page designation --> |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCj9jxSVQKIC&pg=SA18-PA2}}</ref>\n\n[[Breadboard]]s, [[perfboard]]s, and [[stripboard]]s are common for testing new designs. They allow the designer to make quick changes to the circuit during development.\n\n==Analog circuits==\n{{Main|Analogue electronics}}\n[[File:Common Base amplifier.png|thumb|A [[circuit diagram]] representing an analog circuit, in this case a simple amplifier]] \n\n[[analog electronics|Analog electronic circuits]] are those in which current or [[voltage]] may vary continuously with time to correspond to the information being represented. Analog circuitry is constructed from two fundamental building blocks: [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] and [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] circuits.\n\nIn a series circuit, the same current passes through a series of components. A string of Christmas lights is a good example of a series circuit: if one goes out, they all do.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, all the components are connected to the same voltage, and the current divides between the various components according to their resistance.\n\n[[File:Simple electrical schematic with Ohms law.png|right|thumb|width200| A simple schematic showing wires, a resistor, and a battery]]\n\nThe basic components of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s. (In 2012 it was demonstrated that [[memristor]]s can be added to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in [[schematic diagram]]s, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a [[field-effect transistor]] can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.\n\nAn alternative model is to take independent power sources and [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent [[Negative resistance|negative resistors]], [[gyrator]]s, [[negative impedance converter]]s, and [[dependent source]]s as secondary electronic components.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nWhen the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the [[distributed-element model]].  Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant [[characteristic impedance]], and the [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.  Circuits designed according to this approach are [[distributed-element circuit]]s. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.\n\n==Digital circuits==\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\n\nIn [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuits]], electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values.<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Digital Logic Design|author=John Hayes|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1993}}</ref> These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'.  Digital circuits make extensive use of [[transistor]]s, interconnected to create [[logic gate]]s that provide the functions of [[Boolean logic]]: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and combinations thereof.  Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input.  Digital circuits therefore can provide logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions.  (Memory based on [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] is known as [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).  Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) is also widely used.)\n\nThe design process for digital circuits is fundamentally different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design.  As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost.  Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers.  As digital circuits become more complex, issues of time delay, [[race condition|logic races]], power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to circuit density, speed and performance. \n\nDigital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as [[microprocessor]]s, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development. <!-- and to be done through it -->\n\n==Mixed-signal circuits==\n{{main | Mixed-signal integrated circuit }}\n\nMixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits.  Examples include [[comparator]]s, [[timers]], [[phase-locked loop]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.  Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits.  For example, in a receiver,  analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic circuit design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electronic circuits}}\n* [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/ Electronics Circuits Textbook]\n* [http://www.rohm.com/web/global/en_index/ Electronics Fundamentals]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Circuit}}\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic circuits| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n\n[[es:Circuito electr\u00f3nico]]\n[[hu:\u00c1ramk\u00f6r]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:a122:d57f::13e0:f8b1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit"}

There is a fixed cost for each order placed, regardless of the number of units ordered. There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as [[holding cost]], sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item.\n\nWe want to determine the optimal number of units to order so that we minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery and storage of the product.\n\nThe required parameters to the solution are the total demand for the year, the purchase cost for each item, the fixed cost to place the order and the storage cost for each item per year. Note that the number of times an order is placed will also affect the total cost, though this number can be determined from the other parameters.\n\n===Variables===\n*<math>T</math> = total annual inventory cost\n*<math>P</math> = purchase unit price, unit production cost\n*<math>Q</math> = order quantity.\n*<math>Q^*</math> = optimal order quantity.\n*<math>D</math> = annual demand quantity.\n*<math>K</math> = fixed cost per order, setup cost (''not'' per unit, typically cost of ordering and shipping and handling.

There is a fixed cost for each order placed, regardless of the number of units ordered. There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as [[holding cost]], sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item.\n\nWe want to determine the optimal number of units to order so that we minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery and storage of the product.\n\nThe required parameters to the solution are the total demand for the year, the purchase cost for each item, the fixed cost to place the order and the storage cost for each item per year. Note that the number of times an order is placed will also affect the total cost, though this number can be determined from the other parameters.\n\n===Variables===\n*<math>T</math> = total annual inventory cost\n*<math>P</math> = purchase unit price, unit production cost\n*<math>Q</math> = order quantity.\n*<math>Q^*</math> = optimal order quantity.\n*<math>D</math> = annual demand quantity.\n*<math>K</math> = fixed cost per order, setup cost (''not'' per unit, typically cost of ordering and shipping and handling.

{"title_page": "Semiconductor", "text_new": "\n\n{{about||devices using semiconductors and their history|Semiconductor device|other uses}}\n\nA '''semiconductor''' material has an [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] value falling between that of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], such as metallic copper, and an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]], such as glass. Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]] falls as its temperature rises; metals are the opposite. Its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (\"[[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]]\") into the [[crystal structure]]. When two differently-doped regions exist in the same crystal, a [[semiconductor junction]] is created. The behavior of [[charge carrier]]s which include [[electron]]s, [[ion]]s and [[electron hole]]s at these junctions is the basis of [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and all modern [[electronics]]. Some examples of semiconductors are [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[gallium arsenide]], and elements near the so-called \"[[metalloid staircase]]\" on the periodic table. After silicon, gallium arsenide is the second most common semiconductor{{cn|date=October 2018}} and is used in laser diodes, solar cells, microwave-frequency integrated circuits and others. Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most electronic circuits.\n\n[[Semiconductor device]]s can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping, or by the application of electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification, switching, and [[energy conversion]].\n\nThe conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount (of the order of 1 in 10<sup>8</sup>) of pentavalent ([[antimony]], [[phosphorus]], or [[arsenic]]) or trivalent ([[boron]], [[gallium]], [[indium]]) atoms. This process is known as doping and resulting semiconductors are known as doped or extrinsic semiconductors. Apart from doping, the conductivity of a semiconductor can equally be improved by increasing its temperature. This is contrary to the behaviour of a metal in which conductivity decreases with increase in temperature.\n\nThe modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on [[quantum physics]] to explain the movement of charge carriers in a [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref name=Feynman>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=Feynman Lectures on Physics|date=1963|publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>  Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]]\", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type]]\". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the [[p\u2013n junction]]s between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior.\n\nSome of the properties of semiconductor materials were observed throughout the mid 19th and first decades of the 20th century. The first practical application of semiconductors in electronics was the 1904 development of the [[cat's-whisker detector]], a primitive semiconductor diode used in early radio receivers. Developments in quantum physics in turn led to the development of the [[transistor]] in 1947,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shockley|first1=William|title=Electrons and holes in semiconductors : with applications to transistor electronics|date=1950|publisher=R.

There are several developed techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like conducting materials, such as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]]. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. An unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow through the material.<ref name=Neamen>{{cite web|last1=Neamen|first1=Donald|title=Semiconductor Physics and Devices|url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/403/Semiconductor%20Physics%20And%20Devices%20-%20Donald%20Neamen.pdf|publisher=Elizabeth A. Jones}}</ref>\n;Heterojunctions\n:[[Heterojunctions]] occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined together. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped [[germanium]]. This results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The transfer occurs until equilibrium is reached by a process called [[recombination (physics)|recombination]], which causes the migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. A product of this process is charged [[ion]]s, which result in an [[electric field]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n;Excited electrons\n:A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the system, which interact via a process called [[ambipolar diffusion]]. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a semiconducting material, the number of holes and electrons changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or [[photon]]s, which can enter the system and create electrons and holes. The process that creates and annihilates electrons and holes are called [[Carrier generation and recombination|generation]] and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]].<ref name=Neamen />\n;Light emission\n:In certain semiconductors, excited electrons can relax by emitting light instead of producing heat.<ref>By Abdul Al-Azzawi. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iw7NBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=In+certain+semiconductors,+excited+electrons+can+relax+by+emitting+light+instead+of+producing+heat.%5C&source=bl&ots=W0PTjQvQ2L&sig=ukjN-RIXvTMjjbhYd9QRxK14sd4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMncyJmqjLAhVBxWMKHWuiBy0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false Light and Optics: Principles and Practices].\" 2007.

Yacobi, ''Semiconductor Materials: An Introduction to Basic Principles'', Springer 2003 {{ISBN|0-306-47361-5}}, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n* Certain pure elements are found in [[Group 14 elements|Group 14]] of the [[periodic table]]; the most commercially important of these elements are [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Silicon and germanium are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.\n* Binary compounds, particularly between elements in Groups 13 and 15, such as [[gallium arsenide]], Groups 12 and 16, groups 14 and 16, and between different group 14 elements, e.g. [[silicon carbide]].\n* Certain ternary compounds, oxides and alloys.\n* [[Organic semiconductor]]s, made of [[organic compound]]s.\n\nMost common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but [[Amorphous silicon|amorphous]] and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and mixtures of [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with better known semiconductors the properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature, as well as occasional [[negative resistance]]. Such disordered materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors such as silicon. They are generally used in [[thin film]] structures, which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.\n\n===Preparation of semiconductor materials===\n\nAlmost all of today's electronic technology involves the use of semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the [[integrated circuit]] (IC), which are found in [[Laptop computer|laptops]], scanners, [[cell-phone]]s, etc. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nA high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as [[dislocation]]s, [[Crystal twinning|twins]], and [[Crystallographic defect#Planar defects|stacking faults]]) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal [[ingot]]s between {{convert|100|and|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]].\n\nThere is a combination of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called [[thermal oxidation]], which forms [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface of the [[silicon]]. This is used as a [[gate dielectric|gate insulator]] and [[LOCOS|field oxide]]. Other processes are called [[photomask]]s and [[photolithography]]. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuity in the integrated circuit. [[Ultraviolet light]] is used along with a [[photoresist]] layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nEtching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the [[photoresist]] layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called [[plasma etching]]. Plasma etching usually involves an [[plasma etching|etch gas]] pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A common etch gas is [[chlorofluorocarbon]], or more commonly known [[Freon]]. A high [[radio-frequency]] [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The end result is silicon that is etched [[anisotropy|anisotropically]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\nThe last process is called [[doping (semiconductor)|diffusion]]. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the [[p-n junction]]. In order to get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\n==Physics of semiconductors==\n\n===Energy bands and electrical conduction===\n\n{{main article|Electronic band structure|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{{Band structure filling diagram}}\n\nSemiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive behavior, somewhere between that of a conductor and an insulator.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Semiconductors|last = Yu|first = Peter|publisher = Springer-Verlag|year = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-00709-5|location = Berlin|pages = }}</ref>\nThe differences between these materials can be understood in terms of the [[quantum state]]s for electrons, each of which may contain zero or one electron (by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These states are associated with the [[electronic band structure]] of the material.\n[[Electrical conductivity]] arises due to the presence of electrons in states that are [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] (extending through the material), however in order to transport electrons a state must be ''partially filled'', containing an electron only part of the time.<ref>As in the Mott formula for conductivity, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Cutler | first1 = M. | last2 = Mott | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.181.1336 | title = Observation of Anderson Localization in an Electron Gas | journal = Physical Review | volume = 181 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336 | year = 1969 | pmid = | pmc = |bibcode = 1969PhRv..181.1336C }}</ref> If the state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that state.\nThe energies of these quantum states are critical, since a state is partially filled only if its energy is near the [[Fermi level]] (see [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]).\n\nHigh conductivity in a material comes from it having many partially filled states and much state delocalization.\nMetals are good [[electrical conductor]]s and have many partially filled states with energies near their Fermi level.\n[[Insulator (electricity)|Insulators]], by contrast, have few partially filled states, their Fermi levels sit within [[band gap]]s with few energy states to occupy.\nImportantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the band gap ([[valence band]]) and the band of states above the band gap ([[conduction band]]).\nAn (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.<ref name=\"Kittel\">[[Charles Kittel]] (1995) ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 7th ed. Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-11181-3}}.</ref>\n\nA pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good insulator nor a very good conductor.\nHowever, one important feature of semiconductors (and some insulators, known as ''semi-insulators'') is that their conductivity can be increased and controlled by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with impurities and [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]] with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or valence band much closer to the Fermi level, and greatly increase the number of partially filled states.\n\nSome [[Wide-bandgap semiconductor|wider-band gap semiconductor]] materials are sometimes referred to as '''semi-insulators'''. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics, such as substrates for [[High-electron-mobility transistor|HEMT]]. An example of a common semi-insulator is [[gallium arsenide]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. W. Allen|title=Gallium Arsenide as a semi-insulator|journal=Nature|volume= 187|pages=403\u201305|year=1960|doi=10.1038/187403b0|bibcode = 1960Natur.187..403A|issue=4735}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[titanium dioxide]], can even be used as insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap semiconductors for other applications.\n\n===Charge carriers (electrons and holes)===\n\n{{main article|Electron hole}}\n\nThe partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.\nThe electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal [[recombination (physics)|recombination]]) but they can move around for some time.\nThe actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical [[ideal gas]], where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic [[dispersion relation]], and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nBecause the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the [[Drude model]], and introduce concepts such as [[electron mobility]].\n\nFor partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce the concept of an [[electron hole]].\nAlthough the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current.\nIf an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge.\nFor the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron.\nCombined with the ''negative'' effective mass of the electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some positive effective mass.<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nThis particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).\n\n====Carrier generation and recombination====\n{{main article|Carrier generation and recombination}}\n\nWhen [[ionizing radiation]] strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as [[carrier generation and recombination|''electron\u2013hole pair generation'']]. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from [[thermal energy]] as well, in the absence of any external energy source.\n\nElectron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. [[Conservation of energy]] demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of [[energy]] larger than the [[band gap]], be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of [[phonon]]s) or radiation (in the form of [[photon]]s).\n\nIn some states, the generation and recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the [[steady state]] at a given temperature is determined by [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. The precise [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]].\n\nAs the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their numbers, the product is in steady state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might \"flush\" carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately exp(\u2212''E''<sub>''G''</sub>/''kT''), where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is absolute temperature and ''E''<sub>''G''</sub> is band gap.\n\nThe probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps&nbsp;\u2013 impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Louis Nashelsky|first1=Robert L.Boylestad|title=Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited|location=India|isbn=978-81-203-2967-6|pages=7\u201310|edition=9th}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n{{main article|Doping (semiconductor)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their [[crystal lattice]]. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as ''doping''. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an ''[[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]]'' (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as [[Extrinsic semiconductor|''extrinsic'']]. By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.\n\nA 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of 10<sup>22</sup> atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of metal contains on the order of 10<sup>22</sup> free electrons, whereas a 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> sample of pure germanium at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C contains about {{val|4.2|e=22}} atoms, but only {{val|2.5|e=13}} free electrons and {{val|2.5|e=13}} holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 10<sup>17</sup> free electrons in the same volume and the electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.\n\nThe materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]] or [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]]. Semiconductors doped with ''donor'' impurities are called ''n-type'', while those doped with ''acceptor'' impurities are known as ''p-type''. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's [[majority carrier]]. The opposite carrier is called the [[minority carrier]], which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.\n\nFor example, the pure semiconductor [[silicon]] has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants are ''group III'' and ''group V'' elements. Group III elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant state (an electron \"hole\") is created, which can move around the lattice and functions as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with [[boron]] creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with [[phosphorus]] results in an n-type material.\n\nDuring [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacture]], dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element, or [[ion implantation]] can be used to accurately position the doped regions.\n\n===Amorphous semiconductors===\nSome materials, when rapidly cooled to a glassy amorphous state, have semiconducting properties. These include B, [[amorphous silicon|Si]], Ge, Se, and Te, and there are multiple theories to explain them.<ref>[http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/views/pdfs/V07_N3_1968/V7_N3_1968_Feldman.pdf ''Amorphous semiconductors'' 1968]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Amorphous semiconductors: a review of current theories|first1=K.|last1=Hulls|first2=P.

This is contrary to the behavior of metallic substances such as copper. In 1839, [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] reported observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte when struck by light, the [[photovoltaic effect]]. In 1873 [[Willoughby Smith]] observed that [[selenium]] [[resistor]]s exhibit decreasing resistance when light falls on them. In 1874, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] observed conduction and [[Rectifier|rectification]] in metallic [[sulfide]]s, although this effect had been discovered much earlier by Peter Munck af Rosenschold ([[:sv:Peter Munck af Rosensch\u00f6ld|sv]]) writing for the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in 1835,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rslXJmYPjGIC&pg=PA24&dq=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold#v=onepage&q=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold&f=false|title=A History of the World Semiconductor Industry|first=Peter Robin|last=Morris|date=July 22, 1990|publisher=IET|via=Google Books|isbn=9780863412271}}</ref> and [[Arthur Schuster]] found that a copper oxide layer on wires has rectification properties that ceases when the wires are cleaned.

In 1878 [[Edwin Herbert Hall]] demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the [[Hall effect]]. The discovery of the [[electron]] by [[J.J. Thomson]] in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. [[Karl Baedeker (scientist)|Karl Baedeker]], by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. Johan Koenigsberger classified solid materials as metals, insulators and \"variable conductors\" in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term ''Halbleiter'' (semiconductor in modern meaning) in PhD thesis in 1910.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0143-0807/10/4/002 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Early history of the physics and chemistry of semiconductors-from doubts to fact in a hundred years | journal=European Journal of Physics | pages=254\u201364|bibcode = 1989EJPh...10..254B | year=1989 | last1=Busch | first1=G }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oVBNQwAACAAJ|title=Experimentelle Beitr\u00e4ge zur Elektronentheorie aus dem Gebiet der Thermoelektrizit\u00e4t, Inaugural-Dissertation ... von J.

In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by [[Alan Herries Wilson]] and the concept of band gaps had been developed. [[Walter H. Schottky]] and [[Nevill Francis Mott]] developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the [[p\u2013n junction]] and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\nAgreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor. This was later explained by [[John Bardeen]] as due to the extreme \"structure sensitive\" behavior of semiconductors, whose properties change dramatically based on tiny amounts of impurities.<ref name=Morris90/> Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying proportions of trace contaminants produced differing experimental results. This spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion purity.\n\nDevices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided a guide to construction of more capable and reliable devices.\n\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] used the light-sensitive property of selenium to [[Photophone|transmit sound]] over a beam of light in 1880. A working solar cell, of low efficiency, was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in 1883 using a metal plate coated with selenium and a thin layer of gold; the device became commercially useful in photographic light meters in the 1930s.<ref name=Morris90>Peter Robin Morris (1990) ''A History of the World Semiconductor Industry'', IET, {{ISBN|0-86341-227-0}}, pp. 11\u201325</ref> Point-contact microwave detector rectifiers made of lead sulfide were used by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] in 1904; the [[cat's-whisker detector]] using natural galena or other materials became a common device in the [[History of radio|development of radio]].

Round]] observed light emission when electric current passed through [[silicon carbide]] crystals, the principle behind the [[light-emitting diode]]. [[Oleg Losev]] observed similar light emission in 1922 but at the time the effect had no practical use.

These devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders, and for voice communication systems. The point-contact crystal detector became vital for microwave radio systems, since available vacuum tube devices could not serve as detectors above about 4000&nbsp;MHz; advanced radar systems relied on the fast response of crystal detectors.

In 1926, [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] patented a device resembling a [[field-effect transistor]], but it was not practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a [[cut-off frequency]] of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory.<ref name=Morris90/> At [[Bell Labs]], [[William Shockley]] and A.

Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]] falls as its temperature rises; metals are the opposite. Its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (\"[[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]]\") into the [[crystal structure]]. When two differently-doped regions exist in the same crystal, a [[semiconductor junction]] is created. The behavior of [[charge carrier]]s which include [[electron]]s, [[ion]]s and [[electron hole]]s at these junctions is the basis of [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and all modern [[electronics]]. Some examples of semiconductors are [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[gallium arsenide]], and elements near the so-called \"[[metalloid staircase]]\" on the periodic table. After silicon, gallium arsenide is the second most common semiconductor{{cn|date=October 2018}} and is used in laser diodes, solar cells, microwave-frequency integrated circuits and others. Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most electronic circuits.\n\n[[Semiconductor device]]s can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping, or by the application of electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification, switching, and [[energy conversion]].\n\nThe conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount (of the order of 1 in 10<sup>8</sup>) of pentavalent ([[antimony]], [[phosphorus]], or [[arsenic]]) or trivalent ([[boron]], [[gallium]], [[indium]]) atoms. This process is known as doping and resulting semiconductors are known as doped or extrinsic semiconductors. Apart from doping, the conductivity of a semiconductor can equally be improved by increasing its temperature. This is contrary to the behaviour of a metal in which conductivity decreases with increase in temperature.\n\nThe modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on [[quantum physics]] to explain the movement of charge carriers in a [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref name=Feynman>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=Feynman Lectures on Physics|date=1963|publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>  Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]]\", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type]]\". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the [[p\u2013n junction]]s between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior.\n\nSome of the properties of semiconductor materials were observed throughout the mid 19th and first decades of the 20th century. The first practical application of semiconductors in electronics was the 1904 development of the [[cat's-whisker detector]], a primitive semiconductor diode used in early radio receivers. Developments in quantum physics in turn led to the development of the [[transistor]] in 1947,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shockley|first1=William|title=Electrons and holes in semiconductors : with applications to transistor electronics|date=1950|publisher=R.

There are several developed techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like conducting materials, such as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]]. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. An unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow through the material.<ref name=Neamen>{{cite web|last1=Neamen|first1=Donald|title=Semiconductor Physics and Devices|url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/403/Semiconductor%20Physics%20And%20Devices%20-%20Donald%20Neamen.pdf|publisher=Elizabeth A. Jones}}</ref>\n;Heterojunctions\n:[[Heterojunctions]] occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined together. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped [[germanium]]. This results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The transfer occurs until equilibrium is reached by a process called [[recombination (physics)|recombination]], which causes the migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. A product of this process is charged [[ion]]s, which result in an [[electric field]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n;Excited electrons\n:A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the system, which interact via a process called [[ambipolar diffusion]]. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a semiconducting material, the number of holes and electrons changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or [[photon]]s, which can enter the system and create electrons and holes. The process that creates and annihilates electrons and holes are called [[Carrier generation and recombination|generation]] and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]].<ref name=Neamen />\n;Light emission\n:In certain semiconductors, excited electrons can relax by emitting light instead of producing heat.<ref>By Abdul Al-Azzawi. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iw7NBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=In+certain+semiconductors,+excited+electrons+can+relax+by+emitting+light+instead+of+producing+heat.%5C&source=bl&ots=W0PTjQvQ2L&sig=ukjN-RIXvTMjjbhYd9QRxK14sd4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMncyJmqjLAhVBxWMKHWuiBy0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false Light and Optics: Principles and Practices].\" 2007.

Yacobi, ''Semiconductor Materials: An Introduction to Basic Principles'', Springer 2003 {{ISBN|0-306-47361-5}}, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n* Certain pure elements are found in [[Group 14 elements|Group 14]] of the [[periodic table]]; the most commercially important of these elements are [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Silicon and germanium are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.\n* Binary compounds, particularly between elements in Groups 13 and 15, such as [[gallium arsenide]], Groups 12 and 16, groups 14 and 16, and between different group 14 elements, e.g. [[silicon carbide]].\n* Certain ternary compounds, oxides and alloys.\n* [[Organic semiconductor]]s, made of [[organic compound]]s.\n\nMost common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but [[Amorphous silicon|amorphous]] and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and mixtures of [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with better known semiconductors the properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature, as well as occasional [[negative resistance]]. Such disordered materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors such as silicon. They are generally used in [[thin film]] structures, which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.\n\n===Preparation of semiconductor materials===\n\nAlmost all of today's electronic technology involves the use of semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the [[integrated circuit]] (IC), which are found in [[Laptop computer|laptops]], scanners, [[cell-phone]]s, etc. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nA high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as [[dislocation]]s, [[Crystal twinning|twins]], and [[Crystallographic defect#Planar defects|stacking faults]]) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal [[ingot]]s between {{convert|100|and|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]].\n\nThere is a combination of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called [[thermal oxidation]], which forms [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface of the [[silicon]]. This is used as a [[gate dielectric|gate insulator]] and [[LOCOS|field oxide]]. Other processes are called [[photomask]]s and [[photolithography]]. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuity in the integrated circuit. [[Ultraviolet light]] is used along with a [[photoresist]] layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nEtching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the [[photoresist]] layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called [[plasma etching]]. Plasma etching usually involves an [[plasma etching|etch gas]] pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A common etch gas is [[chlorofluorocarbon]], or more commonly known [[Freon]]. A high [[radio-frequency]] [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The end result is silicon that is etched [[anisotropy|anisotropically]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\nThe last process is called [[doping (semiconductor)|diffusion]]. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the [[p-n junction]]. In order to get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon.

These states are associated with the [[electronic band structure]] of the material.\n[[Electrical conductivity]] arises due to the presence of electrons in states that are [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] (extending through the material), however in order to transport electrons a state must be ''partially filled'', containing an electron only part of the time.<ref>As in the Mott formula for conductivity, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Cutler | first1 = M. | last2 = Mott | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.181.1336 | title = Observation of Anderson Localization in an Electron Gas | journal = Physical Review | volume = 181 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336 | year = 1969 | pmid = | pmc = |bibcode = 1969PhRv..181.1336C }}</ref> If the state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that state.\nThe energies of these quantum states are critical, since a state is partially filled only if its energy is near the [[Fermi level]] (see [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]).\n\nHigh conductivity in a material comes from it having many partially filled states and much state delocalization.\nMetals are good [[electrical conductor]]s and have many partially filled states with energies near their Fermi level.\n[[Insulator (electricity)|Insulators]], by contrast, have few partially filled states, their Fermi levels sit within [[band gap]]s with few energy states to occupy.\nImportantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the band gap ([[valence band]]) and the band of states above the band gap ([[conduction band]]).\nAn (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.<ref name=\"Kittel\">[[Charles Kittel]] (1995) ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 7th ed. Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-11181-3}}.</ref>\n\nA pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good insulator nor a very good conductor.\nHowever, one important feature of semiconductors (and some insulators, known as ''semi-insulators'') is that their conductivity can be increased and controlled by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with impurities and [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]] with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or valence band much closer to the Fermi level, and greatly increase the number of partially filled states.\n\nSome [[Wide-bandgap semiconductor|wider-band gap semiconductor]] materials are sometimes referred to as '''semi-insulators'''. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics, such as substrates for [[High-electron-mobility transistor|HEMT]]. An example of a common semi-insulator is [[gallium arsenide]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. W. Allen|title=Gallium Arsenide as a semi-insulator|journal=Nature|volume= 187|pages=403\u201305|year=1960|doi=10.1038/187403b0|bibcode = 1960Natur.187..403A|issue=4735}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[titanium dioxide]], can even be used as insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap semiconductors for other applications.\n\n===Charge carriers (electrons and holes)===\n\n{{main article|Electron hole}}\n\nThe partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.\nThe electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal [[recombination (physics)|recombination]]) but they can move around for some time.\nThe actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical [[ideal gas]], where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic [[dispersion relation]], and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nBecause the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the [[Drude model]], and introduce concepts such as [[electron mobility]].\n\nFor partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce the concept of an [[electron hole]].\nAlthough the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current.\nIf an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge.\nFor the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron.\nCombined with the ''negative'' effective mass of the electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some positive effective mass.<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nThis particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).\n\n====Carrier generation and recombination====\n{{main article|Carrier generation and recombination}}\n\nWhen [[ionizing radiation]] strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as [[carrier generation and recombination|''electron\u2013hole pair generation'']]. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from [[thermal energy]] as well, in the absence of any external energy source.\n\nElectron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. [[Conservation of energy]] demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of [[energy]] larger than the [[band gap]], be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of [[phonon]]s) or radiation (in the form of [[photon]]s).\n\nIn some states, the generation and recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the [[steady state]] at a given temperature is determined by [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. The precise [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]].\n\nAs the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their numbers, the product is in steady state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might \"flush\" carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately exp(\u2212''E''<sub>''G''</sub>/''kT''), where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is absolute temperature and ''E''<sub>''G''</sub> is band gap.\n\nThe probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps&nbsp;\u2013 impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Louis Nashelsky|first1=Robert L.Boylestad|title=Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited|location=India|isbn=978-81-203-2967-6|pages=7\u201310|edition=9th}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n{{main article|Doping (semiconductor)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their [[crystal lattice]]. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as ''doping''. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an ''[[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]]'' (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as [[Extrinsic semiconductor|''extrinsic'']]. By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.\n\nA 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of 10<sup>22</sup> atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of metal contains on the order of 10<sup>22</sup> free electrons, whereas a 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> sample of pure germanium at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C contains about {{val|4.2|e=22}} atoms, but only {{val|2.5|e=13}} free electrons and {{val|2.5|e=13}} holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 10<sup>17</sup> free electrons in the same volume and the electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.\n\nThe materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]] or [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]]. Semiconductors doped with ''donor'' impurities are called ''n-type'', while those doped with ''acceptor'' impurities are known as ''p-type''. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's [[majority carrier]]. The opposite carrier is called the [[minority carrier]], which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.\n\nFor example, the pure semiconductor [[silicon]] has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants are ''group III'' and ''group V'' elements. Group III elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant state (an electron \"hole\") is created, which can move around the lattice and functions as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with [[boron]] creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with [[phosphorus]] results in an n-type material.\n\nDuring [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacture]], dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element, or [[ion implantation]] can be used to accurately position the doped regions.\n\n===Amorphous semiconductors===\nSome materials, when rapidly cooled to a glassy amorphous state, have semiconducting properties. These include B, [[amorphous silicon|Si]], Ge, Se, and Te, and there are multiple theories to explain them.<ref>[http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/views/pdfs/V07_N3_1968/V7_N3_1968_Feldman.pdf ''Amorphous semiconductors'' 1968]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Amorphous semiconductors: a review of current theories|first1=K.|last1=Hulls|first2=P.

This is contrary to the behavior of metallic substances such as copper. In 1839, [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] reported observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte when struck by light, the [[photovoltaic effect]]. In 1873 [[Willoughby Smith]] observed that [[selenium]] [[resistor]]s exhibit decreasing resistance when light falls on them. In 1874, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] observed conduction and [[Rectifier|rectification]] in metallic [[sulfide]]s, although this effect had been discovered much earlier by Peter Munck af Rosenschold ([[:sv:Peter Munck af Rosensch\u00f6ld|sv]]) writing for the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in 1835,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rslXJmYPjGIC&pg=PA24&dq=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold#v=onepage&q=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold&f=false|title=A History of the World Semiconductor Industry|first=Peter Robin|last=Morris|date=July 22, 1990|publisher=IET|via=Google Books|isbn=9780863412271}}</ref> and [[Arthur Schuster]] found that a copper oxide layer on wires has rectification properties that ceases when the wires are cleaned.

In 1878 [[Edwin Herbert Hall]] demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the [[Hall effect]]. The discovery of the [[electron]] by [[J.J. Thomson]] in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. [[Karl Baedeker (scientist)|Karl Baedeker]], by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. Johan Koenigsberger classified solid materials as metals, insulators and \"variable conductors\" in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term ''Halbleiter'' (semiconductor in modern meaning) in PhD thesis in 1910.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0143-0807/10/4/002 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Early history of the physics and chemistry of semiconductors-from doubts to fact in a hundred years | journal=European Journal of Physics | pages=254\u201364|bibcode = 1989EJPh...10..254B | year=1989 | last1=Busch | first1=G }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oVBNQwAACAAJ|title=Experimentelle Beitr\u00e4ge zur Elektronentheorie aus dem Gebiet der Thermoelektrizit\u00e4t, Inaugural-Dissertation ... von J.

In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by [[Alan Herries Wilson]] and the concept of band gaps had been developed. [[Walter H. Schottky]] and [[Nevill Francis Mott]] developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the [[p\u2013n junction]] and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\nAgreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor. This was later explained by [[John Bardeen]] as due to the extreme \"structure sensitive\" behavior of semiconductors, whose properties change dramatically based on tiny amounts of impurities.<ref name=Morris90/> Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying proportions of trace contaminants produced differing experimental results. This spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion purity.\n\nDevices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided a guide to construction of more capable and reliable devices.\n\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] used the light-sensitive property of selenium to [[Photophone|transmit sound]] over a beam of light in 1880. A working solar cell, of low efficiency, was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in 1883 using a metal plate coated with selenium and a thin layer of gold; the device became commercially useful in photographic light meters in the 1930s.<ref name=Morris90>Peter Robin Morris (1990) ''A History of the World Semiconductor Industry'', IET, {{ISBN|0-86341-227-0}}, pp. 11\u201325</ref> Point-contact microwave detector rectifiers made of lead sulfide were used by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] in 1904; the [[cat's-whisker detector]] using natural galena or other materials became a common device in the [[History of radio|development of radio]].

Round]] observed light emission when electric current passed through [[silicon carbide]] crystals, the principle behind the [[light-emitting diode]]. [[Oleg Losev]] observed similar light emission in 1922 but at the time the effect had no practical use.

These devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders, and for voice communication systems. The point-contact crystal detector became vital for microwave radio systems, since available vacuum tube devices could not serve as detectors above about 4000&nbsp;MHz; advanced radar systems relied on the fast response of crystal detectors.

In 1926, [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] patented a device resembling a [[field-effect transistor]], but it was not practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a [[cut-off frequency]] of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory.<ref name=Morris90/> At [[Bell Labs]], [[William Shockley]] and A.
