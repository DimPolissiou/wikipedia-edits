In 1972 following the [[Legal Framework Order No. 1970]], the force was renamed from the West Pakistan Rangers to Pakistan Rangers and given under the control of Federal Government (Ministry of Defence).\n\nIn 1974, it became part of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Civil Armed Forces]] under the Ministry of Interior, where they have remained since.\n\nIn late 1989, due to growing riots and worsening Law and Order situation in Sindh, a new force was raised for a strategic [[anti-dacoit]] operation in the interior of Sindh. The force operated under the name of [[Mehran Force]] and included the then existing Sindh Rangers, 3 Battalions of Pakistan Army (inc. SSG), Northern Scouts. Mehran force was under the direct command of Director General Pakistan Rangers with its nucleus Headquarters in Karachi.\n\nSubsequently, the Federal Government decided to substantially increase the strength of Rangers and the raising of separate Headquarters for Pakistan Rangers in Sindh. Consequently, 1 July 1995 the Pakistan Rangers were bifurcated into two separate forces, the Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and Pakistan Rangers (Sindh). The Mehran Force and other paramilitary units operating in the province of Sindh were merged into the Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).<ref name=\"auto\">{{citeweb|url=http://strelok-analysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pakistans-Rengers.pdf|title=Pakistan Rangers|work=Igor Pejek, University of Belgrade|editor=Jovana Ljubic|publisher=Sterlok Anylisis}}</ref>\n\n==War performances==\n[[File:Pak Ranger at Wagah.jpg|thumb|250px|A Pakistani Ranger- Punjab at the Wagah border.]]\nThe Rangers had fought together with the [[Pakistan Army]] in several conflicts, namely the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 Indo-Pak war]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistan War]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Pakistan Army\n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | author2 = \n  | title =Pakistan Army Rangers (Punjab)\n  | website =Pakistan Army Press Publications\n  | publisher =ISPR\n  | date = \n  | url =http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/AWPReview/TextContent.aspx?pId=139\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = }}\n</ref> After the 1971 war, the force was federalized underneath the [[Ministry of Defense (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]] as the Pakistan Rangers, and, shortly in 1974, it was made a component of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Civil Armed Forces]] (CAF) under the [[Ministry of Interior]].

The Rangers are also responsible for maintaining internal security in Pakistan and a major [[law enforcement in Pakistan|law enforcement organisation in the country]]. Despite this, they are not privileged with the power to arrest like the police except in desperate but rare time eras, when the state temporarily sanctions them with such a power. Their primary objective as an internal security force is to prevent crime by taking preventive security measures, disable organised criminals and thwart organised crime. All suspects apprehended by Rangers are later handed over to police for further investigation and possible prosecution except for the rare instances when Rangers are legally empowered by the state to arrest and detain suspects. The same privileges are also temporarily granted by the government to other security organisations such as the Frontier Corps for the same reasons.\n\nThe Rangers are also tasked with securing important monuments and guarding national assets in all major cities of Pakistan, including [[Islamabad]].\n\nIn the past, they have also served as prison guards for high-profile terrorists until they were withdrawn from such duties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punjab withdraws Rangers from guard duties|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1226883|website=Mohammed Asghar|publisher=[[Dawn News]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers have notably contributed towards maintaining law and order in Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore in major crises.

In 1972 following the [[Legal Framework Order No. 1970]], the force was renamed from the West Pakistan Rangers to Pakistan Rangers and given under the control of Federal Government (Ministry of Defence).\n\nIn 1974, it became part of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Civil Armed Forces]] under the Ministry of Interior, where they have remained since.\n\nIn late 1989, due to growing riots and worsening Law and Order situation in Sindh, a new force was raised for a strategic [[anti-dacoit]] operation in the interior of Sindh. The force operated under the name of [[Mehran Force]] and included the then existing Sindh Rangers, 3 Battalions of Pakistan Army (inc. SSG), Northern Scouts. Mehran force was under the direct command of Director General Pakistan Rangers with its nucleus Headquarters in Karachi.\n\nSubsequently, the Federal Government decided to substantially increase the strength of Rangers and the raising of separate Headquarters for Pakistan Rangers in Sindh. Consequently, 1 July 1995 the Pakistan Rangers were bifurcated into two separate forces, the Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and Pakistan Rangers (Sindh). The Mehran Force and other paramilitary units operating in the province of Sindh were merged into the Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).<ref name=\"auto\">{{citeweb|url=http://strelok-analysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pakistans-Rengers.pdf|title=Pakistan Rangers|work=Igor Pejek, University of Belgrade|editor=Jovana Ljubic|publisher=Sterlok Anylisis}}</ref>\n\n==War performances==\n[[File:Pak Ranger at Wagah.jpg|thumb|250px|A Pakistani Ranger- Punjab at the Wagah border.]]\nThe Rangers had fought together with the [[Pakistan Army]] in several conflicts, namely the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 Indo-Pak war]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistan War]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | last =Pakistan Army\n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | author2 = \n  | title =Pakistan Army Rangers (Punjab)\n  | website =Pakistan Army Press Publications\n  | publisher =ISPR\n  | date = \n  | url =http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/AWPReview/TextContent.aspx?pId=139\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = }}\n</ref> After the 1971 war, the force was federalized underneath the [[Ministry of Defense (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]] as the Pakistan Rangers, and, shortly in 1974, it was made a component of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Civil Armed Forces]] (CAF) under the [[Ministry of Interior]].

The Rangers are also responsible for maintaining internal security in Pakistan and a major [[law enforcement in Pakistan|law enforcement organisation in the country]]. Despite this, they are not privileged with the power to arrest like the police except in desperate but rare time eras, when the state temporarily sanctions them with such a power. Their primary objective as an internal security force is to prevent crime by taking preventive security measures, disable organised criminals and thwart organised crime. All suspects apprehended by Rangers are later handed over to police for further investigation and possible prosecution except for the rare instances when Rangers are legally empowered by the state to arrest and detain suspects. The same privileges are also temporarily granted by the government to other security organisations such as the Frontier Corps for the same reasons.\n\nThe Rangers are also tasked with securing important monuments and guarding national assets in all major cities of Pakistan, including [[Islamabad]].\n\nIn the past, they have also served as prison guards for high-profile terrorists until they were withdrawn from such duties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punjab withdraws Rangers from guard duties|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1226883|website=Mohammed Asghar|publisher=[[Dawn News]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers have notably contributed towards maintaining law and order in Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore in major crises.

It is quite clear that Hindus and Muslims derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes and different episodes.... To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built up for the government of such a state.\"<ref>Cited in Ainslie T.

Allah Bakhsh belonged to a landed family. He founded the Sindh People\u2019s Party in 1934, which later came to be known as \u2018Ittehad\u2019 or \u2018Unity Party\u2019. ... Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League\u2019s demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis. Consequently, he established the Azad Muslim Conference. In its Delhi session held during April 27\u201330, 1940 some 1400 delegates took part. They belonged mainly to the lower castes and working class. The famous scholar of Indian Islam, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, feels that the delegates represented a \u2018majority of India\u2019s Muslims\u2019. Among those who attended the conference were representatives of many Islamic theologians and women also took part in the deliberations ... Shamsul Islam argues that the All-India Muslim League at times used intimidation and coercion to silence any opposition among Muslims to its demand for Partition. He calls such tactics of the Muslim League as a \u2018Reign of Terror\u2019.

Following the death of Sir Sikander in 1942, and bidding to overcome their dismal showing in the elections of 1937, the Muslim League intensified campaigning throughout rural and urban Punjab.<ref>W. W. J. \"The Indian Elections \u2013 1946.\" The World Today, vol. 2, no. 4, 1946, pp. 167\u2013175</ref> A major thrust of the Muslim's League's campaign was the increased use of religious symbolism, as well as the promotion of [[Communalism (South Asia)|communalism]] and spreading fear of a supposed \"Hindu threat\" in a future united India.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot2015\"/> Muslim League activists were advised to join in communal prayers when visiting villages, and gain permission to hold meetings after the Friday prayers.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The [[Quran]] became a symbol of the Muslim League at rallies, and pledges to vote were made on it.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> Students, a key component of the Muslim League's activists, were trained to appeal to the electorate on communal lines, and at the peak of student activity during the Christmas holidays of 1945, 250 students from [[Aligarh Muslim University|Aligarh]] were invited to campaign in the province along with 1550 members of the Punjab Muslim Student's Federation.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> A key achievement of these efforts came in enticing [[Jat Muslim|Muslim Jats]] and [[Gurjar|Gujjars]] from their intercommunal tribal loyalties.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> In response, the Unionists attempted to counter the growing religious appeal of the Muslim League by introducing religious symbolism into their own campaign, but with no student activists to rely upon and dwindling support amongst the landlords, their attempts met with little success.\n\nTo further their religious appeal, the Muslim League also launched efforts to entice [[Pir (Sufism)|Pirs]] towards their cause. Pirs dominated the religious landscape, and were individuals who claimed to inherit religious authority from [[Sufism in India|Sufi Saints]] who had proselytised in the region since the eleventh century.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> By the twentieth century, most Punjabi Muslims offered allegiance to a Pir as their religious guide, thus providing them considerable political influence.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The Unionists had successfully cultivated the support of Pirs to achieve success in the 1937 elections, and the Muslim League now attempted to replicate their method of doing so. To do so, the Muslim League created the Masheikh Committee, used [[Urs]] ceremonies and shrines for meetings and rallies and encouraged fatwas urging support for the Muslim League.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> Reasons for the pirs switching allegiance varied. For the Gilani Pirs of Multan the over-riding factor was local longstanding factional rivalries, whilst for many others a shrines size and relationship with the government dictated its allegiance.<ref name=\"Talbot\" />\n\nDespite the Muslim League's aim to foster a united Muslim loyalty, it also recognised the need to better exploit the [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradari]] network and appeal to primordial tribal loyalties. In 1946 it held a special Gujjar conference intending to appeal to all Muslim Gujjars, and lifted its ban on [[Jahanara Shahnawaz]] with the hope of appealing to [[Arain]] constituencies.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> Appealing to biradari ties enabled the Muslim League to accelerate support amongst landlords, and in turn use the landlords client-patron economic relationship with their tenants to guarantee votes for the forthcoming election.<ref name=\"Talbot\" />\n\nA separate strategy of the Muslim League was to exploit the economic slump suffered in the Punjab as a result of the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The Punjab had supplied 27 per cent of the [[Indian Army]] recruits during the war, constituting 800,000 men, and representing a significant part of the electorate. By 1946, less than 20 per cent of those servicemen returning home had found employment.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> This in part was exacerbated by the speedy end to the war in Asia, which caught the Unionist's by surprise, and meant their plans to deploy servicemen to work in canal colonies were not yet ready.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The Muslim League took advantage of this weakness and followed Congress's example of providing work to servicemen within its organisation.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The Muslim League's ability to offer an alternative to the Unionist government, namely the promise of Pakistan as an answer to the economic dislocation suffered by Punjabi villagers, was identified as a key issue for the election.<ref name=\"Talbot\" />\n\nOn the eve of the elections, the political landscape in the Punjab was finely poised, and the Muslim League offered a credible alternative to the Unionist Party. The transformation itself had been rapid, as most landlords and pirs had not switched allegiance until after 1944.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The breakdown of talks between the Punjab Premier, [[Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] in late 1944 had meant many Muslims were now forced to choose between the two parties at the forthcoming election.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> A further blow for the Unionists came with death of its leading statesman Sir [[Chhotu Ram]] in early 1945.\n\nThe [[West Punjab|Western Punjab]] was home to a minority population of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus up to 1947 apart from the Muslim majority.<ref name=\"Royal Book Company\">{{cite book|last=Salamat|first=Zarina|title=The Punjab in 1920s : a case study of Muslims|year=1997|publisher=Royal Book Company|location=Karachi|isbn=978-969-407-230-2}}</ref> In 1947, the [[Provincial Assembly of the Punjab|Punjab Assembly]] cast its vote in favour of Pakistan with [[Super-majority|supermajority rule]], which made many minority Hindus and Sikhs migrate to India while Muslim refugees from India settled in the Western Punjab and across Pakistan.<ref>Dube, I. &.

In trying to highlight the separateness and vulnerability of Muslims in a religiously diverse public space, the directives of the NWFP ulama began to veer away from simple religious injunctions to take on a communalist tone. The ulama highlighted 'threats' posed by Hindus to Muslims in the province. Accusations of improper behaviour and molestation of Muslim women were levelled against 'Hindu shopkeepers' in Nowshera. Sermons given by two JUS-connected maulvis in Nowshera declared the Hindus the 'enemies' of Islam and Muslims. Posters were distributed in the city warning Muslims not to buy or consume food prepared and sold by Hindus in the bazaars. In 1936, a Hindu girl was abducted by a Muslim in Bannu and then married to him. The government demanded the girl's return, But popular Muslim opinion, supported by a resolution passed by the Jamiyatul Ulama Bannu, demanded that she stay, stating that she had come of her free will, had converted to Islam, and was now lawfully married and had to remain with her husband. Government efforts to retrieve the girl led to accusations of the government being anti-Muslim and of encouraging apostasy, and so stirred up strong anti-Hindu sentiment across the majority Muslim NWFP. ...

Pirs dominated the religious landscape, and were individuals who claimed to inherit religious authority from [[Sufism in India|Sufi Saints]] who had proselytised in the region since the eleventh century.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> By the twentieth century, most Punjabi Muslims offered allegiance to a Pir as their religious guide, thus providing them considerable political influence.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The Unionists had successfully cultivated the support of Pirs to achieve success in the 1937 elections, and the Muslim League now attempted to replicate their method of doing so. To do so, the Muslim League created the Masheikh Committee, used [[Urs]] ceremonies and shrines for meetings and rallies and encouraged fatwas urging support for the Muslim League.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> Reasons for the pirs switching allegiance varied. For the Gilani Pirs of Multan the over-riding factor was local longstanding factional rivalries, whilst for many others a shrines size and relationship with the government dictated its allegiance.<ref name=\"Talbot\" />\n\nDespite the Muslim League's aim to foster a united Muslim loyalty, it also recognised the need to better exploit the [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradari]] network and appeal to primordial tribal loyalties. In 1946 it held a special Gujjar conference intending to appeal to all Muslim Gujjars, and lifted its ban on [[Jahanara Shahnawaz]] with the hope of appealing to [[Arain]] constituencies.<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> Appealing to biradari ties enabled the Muslim League to accelerate support amongst landlords, and in turn use the landlords client-patron economic relationship with their tenants to guarantee votes for the forthcoming election.<ref name=\"Talbot\" />\n\nA separate strategy of the Muslim League was to exploit the economic slump suffered in the Punjab as a result of the [[Second World War]].<ref name=\"Talbot\" /> The Punjab had supplied 27 per cent of the [[Indian Army]] recruits during the war, constituting 800,000 men, and representing a significant part of the electorate.

In trying to highlight the separateness and vulnerability of Muslims in a religiously diverse public space, the directives of the NWFP ulama began to veer away from simple religious injunctions to take on a communalist tone. The ulama highlighted 'threats' posed by Hindus to Muslims in the province. Accusations of improper behaviour and molestation of Muslim women were levelled against 'Hindu shopkeepers' in Nowshera. Sermons given by two JUS-connected maulvis in Nowshera declared the Hindus the 'enemies' of Islam and Muslims. Posters were distributed in the city warning Muslims not to buy or consume food prepared and sold by Hindus in the bazaars. In 1936, a Hindu girl was abducted by a Muslim in Bannu and then married to him. The government demanded the girl's return, But popular Muslim opinion, supported by a resolution passed by the Jamiyatul Ulama Bannu, demanded that she stay, stating that she had come of her free will, had converted to Islam, and was now lawfully married and had to remain with her husband. Government efforts to retrieve the girl led to accusations of the government being anti-Muslim and of encouraging apostasy, and so stirred up strong anti-Hindu sentiment across the majority Muslim NWFP. ...
