Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center near the village of [[Vusanje]] (Vuthaj). The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. \n\nThe town of Gusinje is the seat of the municipality. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. It covers 157 km\u00b2, 1.1% of the total area of Montenegro.<ref name=\"opstina5\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}}</ref> Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding. The territory of Vusanje covers about 1/3 of the municipality. The municipality's settlements are Dolia/Dolja, Dosugja/Dosu\u0111e, Grn\u010dar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar, Kolenovi\u0107i/Kolina, Krysheva/Kru\u0161evo, Martinaj/Martinovi\u0107i, Vi\u0161njevo/Vishnjeva, Vuthaj/Vusanje and the town of Gusinje/Gucia.<ref name=\"opstina5\"/>\n\n== History ==\nIn antiquity, the area of Gusinje was inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of the Labeatae.<ref name=\"Opstina44\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=44}}</ref> Close to [[Lake Plav]] lived another tribe that of the Autariatae. The name of the area may come from an Illyrian toponym ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of Gusinje, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> From the Roman era, remains of a cemetery in Visnjevo and a church in Dolia have been bound. There is also evidence that a mine was operating in the region.<ref name=\"Opstina44\"/>\n\nIn 1330, the toponym ''Hotina Gora'' (mountains of Hoti) in the Plav and Gusinje regions on the [[Lim (river)|Lim]] river basin in 1330. It is the first mention of the Albanian tribe [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]].{{sfn|\u0160ufflay|2000|p=37}} This region is regarded as their original homeland before they moved southwards and settled to their historical territory. It is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. The vilayet of Plav was a relatively densely populated area with 15 villages and over 1,000 households. Most of the villages - with the exception of Gusinje - were concentrated around [[Lake Plav]] and to the north of it.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and were plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. The fortress was also designed to stop the movement of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village of Gusinje had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref>\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] and [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Many of the settlements of Gusinje were also largely created by Kelmendi. The descendants of the communities although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> In 1703, the Ottomans tried again to expel Kelmendi entirely from the highlands. At that time, many were forced to resettle in the [[Pe\u0161ter|Pe\u0161ter plateau]]. Those who remained in their villages in Gusinje were allowed to do so on the condition that they convert to Islam.\n\nIn terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\n==Cultural monuments==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of the historical mosques of Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Triepshi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. It is a symbol of the influence of the Pashalik of Shkodra in the upper Lim valley. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. The oldest mosque in Gusinje was that of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] which was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in a fire in 1746-47.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\">{{harvnb|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe village of Vusanje/Vuthaj and its hamlets, which represent one third of the total territory of the municipality has three mosques. The oldest is that of upper Vusanje, built in 1710. The mosque of lower Vusanje was built in 1910 by the Gjonbalaj (today, ''d\u017eamija Djonbali\u0107a'') brotherhood and its third mosque was built by the Qosja (today, ''d\u017eamija \u0106osovi\u0107a''). Mosques are also found in the village of Martinaj (1800) and Kru\u0161evo.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\"/> In the village of Dolia, there is Catholic church which was built in 1936 and also houses an ethnographic museum. There is also an Orthodox church dedicated to St. George. It was built in 1926 in the reign of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Opstina Gusinje - Kultura |url=https://www.opstinagusinje.me/al/kultura-2/ |publisher=Municipality of Gusinje}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is ~93% Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}} A few (~6%) Orthodox Montenegrins and Serbs are found in the municipality. About half of the village of Dolia/Dolja are Catholics. They form the only Catholic community in Gusinje.\n\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-table;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Historical demography of Gusinje Municipality{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}}\n|-\n!

The territory of Vusanje covers about 1/3 of the municipality. The municipality's settlements are Dolia/Dolja, Dosugja/Dosu\u0111e, Grn\u010dar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar, Kolenovi\u0107i/Kolina, Krysheva/Kru\u0161evo, Martinaj/Martinovi\u0107i, Vi\u0161njevo/Vishnjeva, Vuthaj/Vusanje and the town of Gusinje/Gucia.<ref name=\"opstina5\"/>\n\n== History ==\nIn antiquity, the area of Gusinje was inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of the Labeatae.<ref name=\"Opstina44\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=44}}</ref> Close to [[Lake Plav]] lived another tribe that of the Autariatae. The name of the area may come from an Illyrian toponym ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of Gusinje, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> From the Roman era, remains of a cemetery in Visnjevo and a church in Dolia have been bound. There is also evidence that a mine was operating in the region.<ref name=\"Opstina44\"/>\n\nIn 1330, the toponym ''Hotina Gora'' (mountains of Hoti) in the Plav and Gusinje regions on the [[Lim (river)|Lim]] river basin in 1330. It is the first mention of the Albanian tribe [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]].{{sfn|\u0160ufflay|2000|p=37}} This region is regarded as their original homeland before they moved southwards and settled to their historical territory. It is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. The vilayet of Plav was a relatively densely populated area with 15 villages and over 1,000 households. Most of the villages - with the exception of Gusinje - were concentrated around [[Lake Plav]] and to the north of it.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and were plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. The fortress was also designed to stop the movement of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village of Gusinje had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref>\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] and [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Many of the settlements of Gusinje were also largely created by Kelmendi. The descendants of the communities although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> In 1703, the Ottomans tried again to expel Kelmendi entirely from the highlands. At that time, many were forced to resettle in the [[Pe\u0161ter|Pe\u0161ter plateau]]. Those who remained were forced to convert to Islam. \n\nIn terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\n==Cultural monuments==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of the historical mosques of Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Triepshi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. It is a symbol of the influence of the Pashalik of Shkodra in the upper Lim valley. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. The oldest mosque in Gusinje was that of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] which was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in a fire in 1746-47.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\">{{harvnb|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe village of Vusanje/Vuthaj and its hamlets, which represent one third of the total territory of the municipality has three mosques. The oldest is that of upper Vusanje, built in 1710. The mosque of lower Vusanje was built in 1910 by the Gjonbalaj (today, ''d\u017eamija Djonbali\u0107a'') brotherhood and its third mosque was built by the Qosja (today, ''d\u017eamija \u0106osovi\u0107a''). Mosques are also found in the village of Martinaj (1800) and Kru\u0161evo.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\"/> In the village of Dolia, there is Catholic church which was built in 1936 and also houses an ethnographic museum. There is also an Orthodox church dedicated to St. George. It was built in 1926 in the reign of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Opstina Gusinje - Kultura |url=https://www.opstinagusinje.me/al/kultura-2/ |publisher=Municipality of Gusinje}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is ~93% Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}} A few (~6%) Orthodox Montenegrins and Serbs are found in the municipality. About half of the village of Dolia/Dolja are Catholics. They form the only Catholic community in Gusinje.\n\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-table;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Historical demography of Gusinje Municipality{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}}\n|-\n!

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.\n\nThe success of the sequel, ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', reversed the fortunes of the franchise.

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh ''Star Trek'' film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \"this is not your father's ''Star Trek''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103824300|title=Some Older 'Star Trek' Fans May Skip This Voyage|last=Adler|first=Margo|date=2009-05-06|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> It also would not interfere with CBS's franchise.\n\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous ''Star Trek'' film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airlockalpha.com/6469/star-trek-becomes-highest-grossing-franchise-film-html|title='Star Trek' Becomes Highest Grossing Franchise Film|last=Hinman|first=Michael|date=2009-06-23|website=[[Airlock Alpha]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> The plaudits include the franchise's first [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|makeup]]).

Such conflict often arose from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together.

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]].

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel.

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J.

The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline.

However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide.

A sequel to ''[[Escape from New York]]'', ''Escape from L.A.'' co-stars [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Bruce Campbell]], and [[Pam Grier]]. The film received a mixed reception and was a [[box-office bomb]].<ref>https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/931-john-carpenters-other-sillier-escape/</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1998, [[Los Angeles]] has become immensely crime-ridden and decadent, ultimately being directly governed and patrolled by the recently created United States Police Force. Two years later, on August 23, 2000, a massive earthquake strikes the city, the [[San Fernando Valley]] floods, and the Los Angeles area turns into an island from [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] to [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. A [[theocracy|theocratic]] presidential candidate declares Los Angeles to be sinful and punished by God.\n\nWhen he is elected president for life, he declares that anyone not conforming to the new \"Moral America\" laws that he creates, which ban such things as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, red meat, firearms, profanity, [[atheism]], non-christian religions, and extramarital sex will be stripped of their citizenship and deported to Los Angeles Island unless they repent and choose [[electric chair|death by electrocution]]. A containment wall is built around the island, armed guards and watchtowers are posted, and those sent to the island are exiled permanently.\n\nIn 2013, Cuervo Jones, a [[Shining Path]] Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces the President's daughter, Utopia, via a holographic system and brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the \"[[Damocles#Sword of Damocles|Sword of Damocles]]\" super weapon, a series of satellites capable of [[electromagnetic pulse|rendering all electronic devices anywhere on the planet useless]]. The President intends to use the system to destroy US enemies' ability to function and eventually dominate the world. While traveling aboard ''Air Force Three'', Utopia leaves the plane in an escape pod and lands on Los Angeles Island to join with Cuervo.\n\nWith the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back the United States with the assistance of an allied invasion force of [[third world]] nations that are standing by to attack. Cuervo claims that if the President tries to stop him, he will \"pull the plug\" on the country and black out the capital. Cuervo also knows the secret world code that can knock out power for the entire planet.\n\nSnake Plissken is captured for another series of crimes and is scheduled to be exiled to the island. Upon his arrival for deportation, Snake meets the president and is offered the mission of retrieving the weapon. The President says he will give him a full pardon if he is successful. The president indicates he does not care if Utopia is returned or not, declaring her a traitor. To ensure his compliance, Snake is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus that will kill him within 10 hours; if he completes the mission, he will receive the cure.\n\nSnake is given an assault rifle, a personal holographic projector, a thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock for how long he has to live. He sneaks into the city using a one-man submarine that he loses when the platform it landed on crumbles, causing the sub to sink. Making his way across the island, Snake meets \"Map to the Stars\" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours of Los Angeles. At various times, Snake receives assistance from Pipeline, a surfing enthusiast; Taslima, a woman deported to the island for her [[Islam|Muslim]] faith; and Hershe Las Palmas (formerly Carjack Malone), a [[transvestite]] and past criminal associate of Snake.\n\nSnake defeats Cuervo at his staging area of the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Happy Kingdom by the Sea]] in Anaheim and takes the remote control. Snake leaves the island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter. Cuervo shoots at it with a rocket launcher just before Eddie kills him, but seeing the incoming rocket, Eddie leaps off the chopper, landing safely on an awning. The rocket hits the chopper and kills everyone inside except for Snake and Utopia, who bail out before it crashes. \n\nWhen the president's men reach the crash site, Commander Malloy believes that Snake is trying to trick the President by giving him the wrong remote and proceeds to find another one on Utopia. After checking the disc inside, Commander Malloy announces that they will take the one that Utopia unknowingly had in her possession. The president then has his men take Utopia to the electric chair despite her pleas for forgiveness. Snake remains alive even after his countdown clock reaches zero, and learns that Plutoxin 7 is only a potent [[influenza]] virus whose effects wear off within hours of infection. The president tries to use the satellites to stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida. Activating the remote, the president hears only Eddie's \"Map to the Stars\" intro over \"[[I Love L.A.]]\"\n\nThe president orders Snake's execution, but Snake previously activated his hologram projector, and the Snake who gets shot is an illusion. Snake activates the real control device, entering the world code and ending all technological activity on the planet, against pleas to stop. At the deportation center, Utopia expresses her delight that Snake shut down the Earth and thus saved her. Snake lights a cigarette and blows out the match used to light it, uttering, \"Welcome to the human race.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Snake Plissken]]\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Map to the Stars Eddie\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Pipeline\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as [[President for Life]]\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Taslima\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cmdr.

Ten times better. It's got more to it. It's more mature. It's got a lot more to it. I think some people didn't like it because they felt it was a remake, not a sequel...

A sequel to ''[[Escape from New York]]'', ''Escape from L.A.'' co-stars [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Bruce Campbell]], and [[Pam Grier]]. The film received a mixed reception and was a [[box-office bomb]].<ref>https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/931-john-carpenters-other-sillier-escape/</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1998, [[Los Angeles]] has become immensely crime-ridden and decadent, ultimately being directly governed and patrolled by the recently created United States Police Force. Two years later, on August 23, 2000, a massive earthquake strikes the city, the [[San Fernando Valley]] floods, and the Los Angeles area turns into an island from [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] to [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. A [[theocracy|theocratic]] presidential candidate declares Los Angeles to be sinful and punished by God.\n\nWhen he is elected president for life, he declares that anyone not conforming to the new \"Moral America\" laws that he creates, which ban such things as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, red meat, firearms, profanity, [[atheism]], freedom of religion, and extramarital sex will be stripped of their citizenship and deported to Los Angeles Island unless they repent and choose [[electric chair|death by electrocution]]. A containment wall is built around the island, armed guards and watchtowers are posted, and those sent to the island are exiled permanently.\n\nIn 2013, Cuervo Jones, a [[Shining Path]] Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces the President's daughter, Utopia, via a holographic system and brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the \"[[Damocles#Sword of Damocles|Sword of Damocles]]\" super weapon, a series of satellites capable of [[electromagnetic pulse|rendering all electronic devices anywhere on the planet useless]]. The President intends to use the system to destroy US enemies' ability to function and eventually dominate the world. While traveling aboard ''Air Force Three'', Utopia leaves the plane in an escape pod and lands on Los Angeles Island to join with Cuervo.\n\nWith the satellites under his control, Cuervo promises to take back the United States with the assistance of an allied invasion force of [[third world]] nations that are standing by to attack. Cuervo claims that if the President tries to stop him, he will \"pull the plug\" on the country and black out the capital. Cuervo also knows the secret world code that can knock out power for the entire planet.\n\nSnake Plissken is captured for another series of crimes and is scheduled to be exiled to the island. Upon his arrival for deportation, Snake meets the president and is offered the mission of retrieving the weapon. The President says he will give him a full pardon if he is successful. The president indicates he does not care if Utopia is returned or not, declaring her a traitor. To ensure his compliance, Snake is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus that will kill him within 10 hours; if he completes the mission, he will receive the cure.\n\nSnake is given an assault rifle, a personal holographic projector, a thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock for how long he has to live. He sneaks into the city using a one-man submarine that he loses when the platform it landed on crumbles, causing the sub to sink. Making his way across the island, Snake meets \"Map to the Stars\" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours of Los Angeles. At various times, Snake receives assistance from Pipeline, a surfing enthusiast; Taslima, a woman deported to the island for her [[Islam|Muslim]] faith; and Hershe Las Palmas (formerly Carjack Malone), a [[transvestite]] and past criminal associate of Snake.\n\nSnake defeats Cuervo at his staging area of the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Happy Kingdom by the Sea]] in Anaheim and takes the remote control. Snake leaves the island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter. Cuervo shoots at it with a rocket launcher just before Eddie kills him, but seeing the incoming rocket, Eddie leaps off the chopper, landing safely on an awning. The rocket hits the chopper and kills everyone inside except for Snake and Utopia, who bail out before it crashes. \n\nWhen the president's men reach the crash site, Commander Malloy believes that Snake is trying to trick the President by giving him the wrong remote and proceeds to find another one on Utopia. After checking the disc inside, Commander Malloy announces that they will take the one that Utopia unknowingly had in her possession. The president then has his men take Utopia to the electric chair despite her pleas for forgiveness. Snake remains alive even after his countdown clock reaches zero, and learns that Plutoxin 7 is only a potent [[influenza]] virus whose effects wear off within hours of infection. The president tries to use the satellites to stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida. Activating the remote, the president hears only Eddie's \"Map to the Stars\" intro over \"[[I Love L.A.]]\"\n\nThe president orders Snake's execution, but Snake previously activated his hologram projector, and the Snake who gets shot is an illusion. Snake activates the real control device, entering the world code and ending all technological activity on the planet, against pleas to stop. At the deportation center, Utopia expresses her delight that Snake shut down the Earth and thus saved her. Snake lights a cigarette and blows out the match used to light it, uttering, \"Welcome to the human race.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Snake Plissken]]\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Map to the Stars Eddie\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Pipeline\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as [[President for Life]]\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Taslima\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cmdr.
