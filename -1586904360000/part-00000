The character is voiced by actress and singer [[Donna Murphy]] in her [[voice acting]] debut; Murphy auditioned for the role spontaneously upon learning from her agent that Disney was auditioning actresses for the film's villainous role. Loosely based on Dame Gothel in the German fairy tale \"[[Rapunzel]]\", Mother Gothel is a vain old woman who hoards the supremely strong healing powers of a magical gold flower in order to [[Longevity|live for many, many years]] and remain perpetually [[Eternal youth|young and beautiful]]. When the flower is harvested in order to heal the kingdom's ailing queen, its powers are inherited by the king and the queen's daughter [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]], removing Gothel's access. With her life suddenly endangered, Gothel kidnaps the infant, imprisoning the princess in an isolated tower for eighteen years while posing as her mother in order to exploit her powers.\n\nInspired by [[List of Disney villains|Disney villainesses]] such as the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]] and [[Claude Frollo]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), respectively, Gothel was developed by directors [[Nathan Greno]] and [[Byron Howard]] into a more original, complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately designed to serve as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Rapunzel's, was inspired by the appearance of Murphy herself and American singer [[Cher]].\n\nMother Gothel has been mostly well received by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]], dubbing her a [[scene stealer]], while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics argued that Gothel was too passive, dismissing her as a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and [[Cruella de Vil]] from ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961).\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Conception and creation ===\n[[Walt Disney]] himself first attempted to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Rapunzel]]\" into a feature-length animated film during the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blog.quickflix.com.au/2010/12/27/interview-nathan-greno-and-byron-howard-directors-of-tangled/|title = Interview: Nathan Greno and Byron Howard; directors of Tangled.|date = December 27, 2010|accessdate = August 9, 2014|website = Quickflix|last = Miraudo|first = Simon|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811035447/http://blog.quickflix.com.au/2010/12/27/interview-nathan-greno-and-byron-howard-directors-of-tangled/|archivedate = August 11, 2014}}</ref> However, the filmmaker's efforts were never fully realized because the fairy tale was considered too \"small\".<ref name=\":8\" /> In 2008, co-directors [[Nathan Greno]] and [[Byron Howard]] decided to enlarge the film's scale in order to transform it into a \"big event\" in order for it to be successful.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.dvdizzy.com/tangled-directors-interview.html|title = Interview: Tangled Directors Nathan Greno & Byron Howard|date = March 28, 2011|accessdate = August 8, 2014|website = DVDizzy.com|publisher = DVDizzy.com|last = Bonanno|first = Luke}}</ref> Meanwhile, the character Mother Gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based,<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16945/byron-howard-nathan-greno-interview-tangled-disney-animation-and-directing-disney-royalty|title = Byron Howard & Nathan Greno interview: Tangled, Disney, animation and directing Disney royalty|date = January 28, 2011|accessdate = August 8, 2014|website = Den of Geek|publisher = [[Dennis Publishing Limited]]|last = Brew|first = Simon}}</ref> conceiving her as \"a very lonely woman who really did not know how to have a relationship of any kind\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-EXCLUSIVE-Donna-Murphy-Talks-Disneys-TANGLED-20010101#.U-EHTmNAWRk|title = BWW EXCLUSIVE: Donna Murphy Talks Disney's TANGLED|date = September 27, 2010|accessdate = August 5, 2014|website = Broadway World.com|publisher = Wisdom Digital Media.|last = Cerasaro|first = Pat}}</ref> Little else had been determined about the character at the time, who was simply described as \"the type of woman who ... envisioned herself in the spotlight.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> A departure from traditional [[Disney Villains|Disney villains]], Mother Gothel is not a witch or a sorceress.

For hundreds of years, Gothel, a vain old crone, hoarded the rejuvenation powers of a magical golden flower in order to remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret from the rest of the kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, posing as Rapunzel's \u201cloving and protective\u201d mother and prohibiting her from leaving, telling her that the outside world is full of dangers and people would take advantage of Rapunzel's hair but really she just wants to keep the power of the hair to herself.\n\nAs her eighteenth birthday approaches, Rapunzel continues to grow eager to leave the tower in order to view the mysterious \"floating lights\" secretly \u2013 lanterns released annually by the King and Queen in remembrance of their lost daughter \u2013 from up close. While Gothel, reprimanding Rapunzel when she asks, forbids this, she agrees to Rapunzel's request to take a three-day-long journey to retrieve art supplies for Rapunzel, giving her just enough time to escape the tower, aided by a wanted thief named Flynn Rider. However, not too far from the castle, Gothel is soon tipped off by Maximus, a guard horse who is searching for Flynn, that Rapunzel has gone missing. With her life endangered and her age rapidly increasing, Gothel desperately pursues Rapunzel and Flynn.\n\nEnlisting the help of the [[Stabbington brothers]], a duo of muscular thieves who were once betrayed by Flynn, Gothel offers them both revenge on Flynn Rider and Rapunzel's gift once they agree to help her find them, not intending to keep the latter half of her promise as she only wants Rapunzel for herself. When her initial attempt to convince Rapunzel to return home with her fails, Gothel, upon a second encounter, tricks the Stabbington Brothers into immobilizing Flynn, later knocking them unconscious when they attempt to kidnap Rapunzel. Convincing Rapunzel that Flynn has betrayed her, they return to the tower. While Flynn escapes from the dungeon, Rapunzel suddenly realizes her true identity and rebels against Gothel, only to be chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Flynn upon his arrival to rescue Rapunzel, but agrees to free Rapunzel long enough to heal him on the condition that she remain with her forever. However, Flynn unexpectedly cuts Rapunzel's hair, causing it to lose its magic. It turns brown, and a horrified Gothel (failing to salvage Rapunzel's hair) ages rapidly, falling out of the tower's window but disintegrating into dust before she hits the ground, essentially dying of old age. Flynn succumbs to his wound and dies in Rapunzel's arms, but is miraculously returned to life by Rapunzel's tear, and she is finally reunited with her biological parents.\n\n===''Tangled: Before Ever After''===\nHaving aged into dust six months earlier, Mother Gothel appears in the 2D ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]'' only as a painting in [[Rapunzel (Disney)|Rapunzel]]'s mural on her bedchamber walls. Eugene (Flynn Rider) had described how she had hoarded the mystical healing powers of the golden Sundrop Flower to sustain her youth and how she had stolen the infant princess and kept her locked up in a tower for eighteen long years. She is last mentioned when Eugene had saved Rapunzel from her wrath, which had resulted in him being stabbed to death by her silver knife.\n\nA few days later, when the coronation ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of the notorious criminal Lady Cain had told Rapunzel that she had no idea who she was dealing with, to which Rapunzel replied that she has \"dealt with much worse\" as a reference to the woman who had abducted her as an infant and raised her as her own daughter for the past eighteen years.\n\n===''Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure''===\nShe appears in a nightmare Princess Rapunzel had, in \"What the Hair!?\" after her seventy-feet long magical blonde hair had mysteriously returned nearly a [[Tangled: Before Ever After|week ago]]. She had bragged about how Rapunzel thought that she was \"gone forever\" and had expressed her wicked delight in seeing that her \"daughter's\" golden hair and its mystical properties had returned. She then comfortingly told Rapunzel that she came back to bring her back to her tower, where she would be \"safe and secure.\" It was then that the black rock spikes, which resulted in the regrowth of Rapunzel's 70-feet [[Blonde|golden hair]], appear all around her.\n\nIn \"The Quest for Varian\", a smug Eugene had shown Maximus the window of the tower was \"where Mother Gothel fell to her doom.\"\n\nIn \"The Alchemist Returns\" Princess Rapunzel says to her father, King Fredric, that he is not the first person to lie to her and say that she is not ready for the real world, as a reference to her adopted mother.\n\nIn the second season's episode \"Rapunzel: Day One\" Gothel is referenced by an amnesic Rapunzel who, having lost her memories, naturally thinks that Gothel is her mother. She excitedly pointed out to Cassandra that she should \"try the special spice Mother makes\".\n \nShe reappeared in \"Rapunzeltopia\" in a nightmare created by the evil magic of Tromus the Eternal, one of the ghostly disciples of the dark sorcerer Zhan Tiri. In \"Lost and Found\" a flashback of Lord Demantius' implies that Gothel was formerly one of his three disciples who had double-crossed him to his longtime archenemy Zhan Tiri.\n\nIn the first half of the final season premiere, \"Rapunzel's Return\" Cassandra encountered a child-like spirit later revealed to be Zhan Tiri. Zhan Tiri reveals to Cassandra that she is Gothel's biological daughter, showing her the events following the newborn Rapunzel's abduction where Gothel abandoned her four-year old Cassandra when the Captain of Royal Guard stumbled across her cottage with him adopting the girl. Zhan Tiri exploits that resentment to turn Cassandra on her friends, lashing out at her adopted father in \"Islands Apart\" for hiding the truth of her mother from her. She also lashes at Rapunzel in the 2-part episode \"Cassandra's Revenge,\" stating to Rapunzel that they should \"have a chat\" about her mother choosing Rapunzel over her own flesh and blood. Rapunzel tried to explain that Gothel had abducted her and held her against her will, that it was not her decision. Still incensed, Cassandra asked if it was her decision to [[Tangled|push her out a window]].\n\nIn \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" it is said that Gothel's restless spirit now haunts the cottage where she had lived with a young Cassandra before deserting her. A curious Cassandra and Rapunzel go to investigate these rumors, but it is actually a ruse by the Enchanted Girl (Zhan Tiri) to further push the human hosts of the Sundrop Flower and Moonstone Opal apart. By further exploring, the two women find out that Gothel had a diary of sorts in the form of magic mirrors, that displayed her overly narcissistic self and disdain for her young daughter Cassandra. A painting of her is seen above the fireplace before it was burned by green fire. \nA missing hand mirror then showed a seemingly loving memory of Gothel expressing her motherly affection toward Cassandra but was, in truth, hiding the fact that she had only said such sweet words to keep Cassandra out of her hair for awhile, as she always considered her own child a \"lousy, little pest.\"\n\n== In other media ==\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nIn addition to the popular Mother Gothel Classic Doll<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disneystore.com/mother-gothel-classic-doll-12/mp/1355026/1000259/ |title=Mother Gothel Classic Doll |accessdate=August 12, 2014 |website=Disney Store |publisher=Dana |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813181827/http://www.disneystore.com/mother-gothel-classic-doll-12/mp/1355026/1000259/ |archivedate=August 13, 2014 }}</ref> and appearing alongside Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus in the Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.disneystore.com/rapunzel-tangled-figure-play-set/mp/1355132/1000262/#longDesc|title = Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set|date = |accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = Disney Store|publisher = Disney|last = |first = }}</ref> the character's likeness has since been adapted and modified by Disney into a much more glamorous doll for sale alongside several re-imagined Disney villainesses as part of the company's Disney Villains Designer Collection, released in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailydot.com/geek/why-we-root-for-our-favorite-disney-villains/|title = Why we can't stop rooting for Disney villains|date = June 27, 2014|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = The Daily Dot|publisher = |last = Romano|first = Aja}}</ref> Costumed in a long [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] gown made of [[satin]], Gothel wears her thick black hair in \"a theatrical up-do.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blog.disneystore.com/blog/2012/08/disney-villains-designer-collection-spotlight-mother-gothel.html|title = Disney Villains Designer Collection Spotlight: Mother Gothel|date = August 23, 2012|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = Disney Store|publisher = Disney|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===''Once Upon a Time''===\n{{see|Gothel (Once Upon a Time)}}\n\nMother Gothel, also known as [[Mother Nature]], appears on the ABC television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', portrayed by actress [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]].

The character is voiced by actress and singer [[Donna Murphy]] in her [[voice acting]] debut; Murphy auditioned for the role spontaneously upon learning from her agent that Disney was auditioning actresses for the film's villainous role. Loosely based on Dame Gothel in the German fairy tale \"[[Rapunzel]]\", Mother Gothel is a vain old woman who hoards the supremely strong healing powers of a magical gold flower in order to [[Longevity|live for many, many years]] and remain perpetually [[Eternal youth|young and beautiful]]. When the flower is harvested in order to heal the kingdom's ailing queen, its powers are inherited by the king and the queen's daughter [[Rapunzel (Tangled)|Rapunzel]], removing Gothel's access. With her life suddenly endangered, Gothel kidnaps the infant, imprisoning the princess in an isolated tower for eighteen years while posing as her mother in order to exploit her powers.\n\nInspired by [[List of Disney villains|Disney villainesses]] such as the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]] and [[Lady Tremaine]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), respectively, Gothel was developed by directors [[Nathan Greno]] and [[Byron Howard]] into a more original, complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately designed to serve as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Rapunzel's, was inspired by the appearance of Murphy herself and American singer [[Cher]].\n\nMother Gothel has been mostly well received by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]], dubbing her a [[scene stealer]], while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics argued that Gothel was too passive, dismissing her as a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and [[Cruella de Vil]] from ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961).\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Conception and creation ===\n[[Walt Disney]] himself first attempted to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Rapunzel]]\" into a feature-length animated film during the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blog.quickflix.com.au/2010/12/27/interview-nathan-greno-and-byron-howard-directors-of-tangled/|title = Interview: Nathan Greno and Byron Howard; directors of Tangled.|date = December 27, 2010|accessdate = August 9, 2014|website = Quickflix|last = Miraudo|first = Simon|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811035447/http://blog.quickflix.com.au/2010/12/27/interview-nathan-greno-and-byron-howard-directors-of-tangled/|archivedate = August 11, 2014}}</ref> However, the filmmaker's efforts were never fully realized because the fairy tale was considered too \"small\".<ref name=\":8\" /> In 2008, co-directors [[Nathan Greno]] and [[Byron Howard]] decided to enlarge the film's scale in order to transform it into a \"big event\" in order for it to be successful.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.dvdizzy.com/tangled-directors-interview.html|title = Interview: Tangled Directors Nathan Greno & Byron Howard|date = March 28, 2011|accessdate = August 8, 2014|website = DVDizzy.com|publisher = DVDizzy.com|last = Bonanno|first = Luke}}</ref> Meanwhile, the character Mother Gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based,<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16945/byron-howard-nathan-greno-interview-tangled-disney-animation-and-directing-disney-royalty|title = Byron Howard & Nathan Greno interview: Tangled, Disney, animation and directing Disney royalty|date = January 28, 2011|accessdate = August 8, 2014|website = Den of Geek|publisher = [[Dennis Publishing Limited]]|last = Brew|first = Simon}}</ref> conceiving her as \"a very lonely woman who really did not know how to have a relationship of any kind\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-EXCLUSIVE-Donna-Murphy-Talks-Disneys-TANGLED-20010101#.U-EHTmNAWRk|title = BWW EXCLUSIVE: Donna Murphy Talks Disney's TANGLED|date = September 27, 2010|accessdate = August 5, 2014|website = Broadway World.com|publisher = Wisdom Digital Media.|last = Cerasaro|first = Pat}}</ref> Little else had been determined about the character at the time, who was simply described as \"the type of woman who ... envisioned herself in the spotlight.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> A departure from traditional [[Disney Villains|Disney villains]], Mother Gothel is not a witch or a sorceress.

For hundreds of years, Gothel, a vain old crone, hoarded the rejuvenation powers of a magical golden flower in order to remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret from the rest of the kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, posing as Rapunzel's \u201cloving and protective\u201d mother and prohibiting her from leaving, telling her that the outside world is full of dangers and people would take advantage of Rapunzel's hair but really she just wants to keep the power of the hair to herself.\n\nAs her eighteenth birthday approaches, Rapunzel continues to grow eager to leave the tower in order to view the mysterious \"floating lights\" secretly \u2013 lanterns released annually by the King and Queen in remembrance of their lost daughter \u2013 from up close. While Gothel, reprimanding Rapunzel when she asks, forbids this, she agrees to Rapunzel's request to take a three-day-long journey to retrieve art supplies for Rapunzel, giving her just enough time to escape the tower, aided by a wanted thief named Flynn Rider. However, not too far from the castle, Gothel is soon tipped off by Maximus, a guard horse who is searching for Flynn, that Rapunzel has gone missing. With her life endangered and her age rapidly increasing, Gothel desperately pursues Rapunzel and Flynn.\n\nEnlisting the help of the [[Stabbington brothers]], a duo of muscular thieves who were once betrayed by Flynn, Gothel offers them both revenge on Flynn Rider and Rapunzel's gift once they agree to help her find them, not intending to keep the latter half of her promise as she only wants Rapunzel for herself. When her initial attempt to convince Rapunzel to return home with her fails, Gothel, upon a second encounter, tricks the Stabbington Brothers into immobilizing Flynn, later knocking them unconscious when they attempt to kidnap Rapunzel. Convincing Rapunzel that Flynn has betrayed her, they return to the tower. While Flynn escapes from the dungeon, Rapunzel suddenly realizes her true identity and rebels against Gothel, only to be chained and gagged. Gothel stabs Flynn upon his arrival to rescue Rapunzel, but agrees to free Rapunzel long enough to heal him on the condition that she remain with her forever. However, Flynn unexpectedly cuts Rapunzel's hair, causing it to lose its magic. It turns brown, and a horrified Gothel (failing to salvage Rapunzel's hair) ages rapidly, falling out of the tower's window but disintegrating into dust before she hits the ground, essentially dying of old age. Flynn succumbs to his wound and dies in Rapunzel's arms, but is miraculously returned to life by Rapunzel's tear, and she is finally reunited with her biological parents.\n\n===''Tangled: Before Ever After''===\nHaving aged into dust six months earlier, Mother Gothel appears in the 2D ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]'' only as a painting in [[Rapunzel (Disney)|Rapunzel]]'s mural on her bedchamber walls. Eugene (Flynn Rider) had described how she had hoarded the mystical healing powers of the golden Sundrop Flower to sustain her youth and how she had stolen the infant princess and kept her locked up in a tower for eighteen long years. She is last mentioned when Eugene had saved Rapunzel from her wrath, which had resulted in him being stabbed to death by her silver knife.\n\nA few days later, when the coronation ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of the notorious criminal Lady Cain had told Rapunzel that she had no idea who she was dealing with, to which Rapunzel replied that she has \"dealt with much worse\" as a reference to the woman who had abducted her as an infant and raised her as her own daughter for the past eighteen years.\n\n===''Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure''===\nShe appears in a nightmare Princess Rapunzel had, in \"What the Hair!?\" after her seventy-feet long magical blonde hair had mysteriously returned nearly a [[Tangled: Before Ever After|week ago]]. She had bragged about how Rapunzel thought that she was \"gone forever\" and had expressed her wicked delight in seeing that her \"daughter's\" golden hair and its mystical properties had returned. She then comfortingly told Rapunzel that she came back to bring her back to her tower, where she would be \"safe and secure.\" It was then that the black rock spikes, which resulted in the regrowth of Rapunzel's 70-feet [[Blonde|golden hair]], appear all around her.\n\nIn \"The Quest for Varian\", a smug Eugene had shown Maximus the window of the tower was \"where Mother Gothel fell to her doom.\"\n\nIn \"The Alchemist Returns\" Princess Rapunzel says to her father, King Fredric, that he is not the first person to lie to her and say that she is not ready for the real world, as a reference to her adopted mother.\n\nIn the second season's episode \"Rapunzel: Day One\" Gothel is referenced by an amnesic Rapunzel who, having lost her memories, naturally thinks that Gothel is her mother. She excitedly pointed out to Cassandra that she should \"try the special spice Mother makes\".\n \nShe reappeared in \"Rapunzeltopia\" in a nightmare created by the evil magic of Tromus the Eternal, one of the ghostly disciples of the dark sorcerer Zhan Tiri. In \"Lost and Found\" a flashback of Lord Demantius' implies that Gothel was formerly one of his three disciples who had double-crossed him to his longtime archenemy Zhan Tiri.\n\nIn the first half of the final season premiere, \"Rapunzel's Return\" Cassandra encountered a child-like spirit later revealed to be Zhan Tiri. Zhan Tiri reveals to Cassandra that she is Gothel's biological daughter, showing her the events following the newborn Rapunzel's abduction where Gothel abandoned her four-year old Cassandra when the Captain of Royal Guard stumbled across her cottage with him adopting the girl. Zhan Tiri exploits that resentment to turn Cassandra on her friends, lashing out at her adopted father in \"Islands Apart\" for hiding the truth of her mother from her. She also lashes at Rapunzel in the 2-part episode \"Cassandra's Revenge,\" stating to Rapunzel that they should \"have a chat\" about her mother choosing Rapunzel over her own flesh and blood. Rapunzel tried to explain that Gothel had abducted her and held her against her will, that it was not her decision. Still incensed, Cassandra asked if it was her decision to [[Tangled|push her out a window]].\n\nIn \"A Tale of Two Sisters\" it is said that Gothel's restless spirit now haunts the cottage where she had lived with a young Cassandra before deserting her. A curious Cassandra and Rapunzel go to investigate these rumors, but it is actually a ruse by the Enchanted Girl (Zhan Tiri) to further push the human hosts of the Sundrop Flower and Moonstone Opal apart. By further exploring, the two women find out that Gothel had a diary of sorts in the form of magic mirrors, that displayed her overly narcissistic self and disdain for her young daughter Cassandra. A painting of her is seen above the fireplace before it was burned by green fire. \nA missing hand mirror then showed a seemingly loving memory of Gothel expressing her motherly affection toward Cassandra but was, in truth, hiding the fact that she had only said such sweet words to keep Cassandra out of her hair for awhile, as she always considered her own child a \"lousy, little pest.\"\n\n== In other media ==\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nIn addition to the popular Mother Gothel Classic Doll<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disneystore.com/mother-gothel-classic-doll-12/mp/1355026/1000259/ |title=Mother Gothel Classic Doll |accessdate=August 12, 2014 |website=Disney Store |publisher=Dana |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813181827/http://www.disneystore.com/mother-gothel-classic-doll-12/mp/1355026/1000259/ |archivedate=August 13, 2014 }}</ref> and appearing alongside Rapunzel, Flynn, Pascal and Maximus in the Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.disneystore.com/rapunzel-tangled-figure-play-set/mp/1355132/1000262/#longDesc|title = Rapunzel Tangled Figure Play Set|date = |accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = Disney Store|publisher = Disney|last = |first = }}</ref> the character's likeness has since been adapted and modified by Disney into a much more glamorous doll for sale alongside several re-imagined Disney villainesses as part of the company's Disney Villains Designer Collection, released in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dailydot.com/geek/why-we-root-for-our-favorite-disney-villains/|title = Why we can't stop rooting for Disney villains|date = June 27, 2014|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = The Daily Dot|publisher = |last = Romano|first = Aja}}</ref> Costumed in a long [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] gown made of [[satin]], Gothel wears her thick black hair in \"a theatrical up-do.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blog.disneystore.com/blog/2012/08/disney-villains-designer-collection-spotlight-mother-gothel.html|title = Disney Villains Designer Collection Spotlight: Mother Gothel|date = August 23, 2012|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = Disney Store|publisher = Disney|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===''Once Upon a Time''===\n{{see|Gothel (Once Upon a Time)}}\n\nMother Gothel, also known as [[Mother Nature]], appears on the ABC television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', portrayed by actress [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]].
