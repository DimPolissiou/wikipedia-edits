It was released in January 1997 as the lead single from the album ''[[Women in Technology (album)|Women in Technology]]''.

The song was heard by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], who played it on the radio station in 1997, helping Mishra gain recognition in a short space of time.<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nMishra has stated that the lyrics could stem from or be related to multiple situations. He says \"When I wrote it, I was trying to write a pop song that had more than one perspective. Although it's written in the first person, the character behind that viewpoint isn't necessarily what the casual listener would expect\".<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ |title=White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered! |publisher=Whitetown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>\n\nMishra wrote that the themes of the song include: \"Being a member of an orthodox [[Trotskyist]] / [[Marxist]] movement. Being a straight guy in love with a lesbian. Being a gay guy in love with a straight man. Being a straight girl in love with a lying, two-timing, fake-arse Marxist. The hypocrisy that results when love and lust get mixed up with highbrow ideals.\"<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\"/> Mishra admitted that being signed to a major label ([[EMI]]) didn't allow him to express creative control, and the loss of his anonymity due to the song's popularity drove him \"mad\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nThe '>Abort, Retry, Fail?_' message that appeared on some inlay cards was explained by the artist: \"Well, this cheerful message became a kind of [[shibboleth]] for me and sort-of characterizes what's been going on for me the last few years.\" The song was mixed on a microcomputer, the [[Atari ST]].\n\n==Composition==\nJ'na Jefferson of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine summarized the song's production as a [[juxtaposition]] of the sampled track's (\"My Woman\" by [[Al Bowlly#References in popular culture|Al Bowlly]]), \"despondent sound with upbeat, enduring energy\", which Mishra said was inspired by the 1970s [[BBC]] drama-comedy series\u00a0[[Pennies From Heaven (TV series)|''Pennies From Heaven'']]. The song's lyrics contain various perspectives about love and relationships, and is, according to Mishra, a \"flip\" of Bowlly's original \"anti-woman\" theme. \nRegarding the song's concept and the perspective of which it is sang from, Mishra said \"When you love somebody, it's not logical, it's not rational, and you think 'This is ridiculous, I can never be with you, I can never be the person you need, why am I even feeling these feelings?' So, I was trying to write from all these\u00a0different sides\u2026 I wanted people to go 'this is catchy' and sing it, but then be like, 'What the hell?' at the same time\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that \"the lines dividing electronic dance music and hip-hop are blurred on this instantly infectious ditty, Actually, the real creative inspiration here appears to come from \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" and other classic hits by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. It's evident in the jangly guitar licks and the bounce of the backbeat.\" They commented further that \"those with no historical reference will probably find the distorted vocals and mind-numbing horn samples good fun.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-03-01.pdf|title=Single Reviews: New & Noteworthy|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=6 February 2020|page=60|format=PDF}}</ref> Gina Morris from ''[[Smash Hits]]'' commented that \"what's cool is that he recorded his debut single in his own room and then watched it go to number one.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/smashhits90s/37290378546/in/album-72157660892601268/|title=Review: Albums|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=|issue=476|page=60|date=26 February 1997|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n \n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was produced in black and white [[silent film]] style. Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed in [[Derby]].\n\nIn the video, there are numerous elements of acting, cinematography and editing that suggest an old fashioned film style. The exaggerated gestures of the hat wearing woman, helpless and fearful, and those of her quick tempered lover hint at the acting style from 1920s [[Expressionism (film)|expressionist films]]. The ostensive [[metaphor]]s, such as the use of hypnosis on the woman by the man or the recurring shots of crossroad signs bearing names of romantic relationship related attitudes, remind of the 1920s and 1930s efforts to express [[subjectivism]] in film.\n\nThe use of circular masks, as to emphasise focal points or for a mere elegant look, also belongs to the aforementioned period. At the point where the woman first enters the man's bedroom and in the final rope scene, [[match cut]]s are used in a manner resemblant of that from silent experimental films. Mishra can be seen for brief moments on television screens in the background.\n\nThere is also a scene where the woman closes the door on the man's arm, as she tries to escape from his advances. This is a direct reference to scene from [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Luis Bu\u00f1uel's]] [[surrealism|surrealist]] film ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1928).\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Australia|2|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Austria|23|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Flanders|20|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Wallonia|7|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadatopsingles|4|chartid=3217|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|22|chartid=3232|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadadance|5|chartid=3233|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadarock|2|chartid=3188|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49|title=Billboard \u2013 Google Books|via=[[Google Books]]|date=12 April 1997|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-02-08.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=6|page=19|date=8 February 1997|access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n|11\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Finland|4|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|France|5|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Germany2|24|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|songid=3405|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-05-24.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|work=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://timarit.is/files/12413915.pdf#navpanes=1&view=FitH|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (NR. 209 Vikuna 20.2.

The song was heard by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], who played it on the radio station in 1997, helping Mishra gain recognition in a short space of time.<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nMishra has stated that the lyrics could stem from or be related to multiple situations. He says \"When I wrote it, I was trying to write a pop song that had more than one perspective. Although it's written in the first person, the character behind that viewpoint isn't necessarily what the casual listener would expect\".<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ |title=White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered! |publisher=Whitetown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>\n\nMishra wrote that the themes of the song include: \"Being a member of an orthodox [[Trotskyist]] / [[Marxist]] movement. Being a straight guy in love with a lesbian. Being a gay guy in love with a straight man. Being a straight girl in love with a lying, two-timing, fake-arse Marxist. The hypocrisy that results when love and lust get mixed up with highbrow ideals.\"<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\"/> Mishra admitted that being signed to a major label ([[EMI]]) didn't allow him to express creative control, and the loss of his anonymity due to the song's popularity drove him \"mad\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nThe '>Abort, Retry, Fail?_' message that appeared on some inlay cards was explained by the artist: \"Well, this cheerful message became a kind of [[shibboleth]] for me and sort-of characterizes what's been going on for me the last few years.\" The song was mixed on a microcomputer, the [[Atari ST]].\n\n==Composition==\nJ'na Jefferson of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine summarized the song's production as a [[juxtaposition]] of the sampled track's (\"My Woman\" by [[Al Bowlly#References in popular culture|Al Bowlly]]), \"despondent sound with upbeat, enduring energy\", which Mishra said was inspired by the 1970s [[BBC]] drama-comedy series\u00a0[[Pennies From Heaven (TV series)|''Pennies From Heaven'']]. The song's lyrics contain various perspectives about love and relationships, and is, according to Mishra, a \"flip\" of Bowlly's original \"anti-woman\" theme. \nRegarding the song's concept and the perspective of which it is sang from, Mishra said \"When you love somebody, it's not logical, it's not rational, and you think 'This is ridiculous, I can never be with you, I can never be the person you need, why am I even feeling these feelings?' So, I was trying to write from all these\u00a0different sides\u2026 I wanted people to go 'this is catchy' and sing it, but then be like, 'What the hell?' at the same time\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that \"the lines dividing electronic dance music and hip-hop are blurred on this instantly infectious ditty, Actually, the real creative inspiration here appears to come from \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" and other classic hits by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. It's evident in the jangly guitar licks and the bounce of the backbeat.\" They commented further that \"those with no historical reference will probably find the distorted vocals and mind-numbing horn samples good fun.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-03-01.pdf|title=Single Reviews: New & Noteworthy|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=6 February 2020|page=60|format=PDF}}</ref> Gina Morris from ''[[Smash Hits]]'' commented that \"what's cool is that he recorded his debut single in his own room and then watched it go to number one.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/smashhits90s/37290378546/in/album-72157660892601268/|title=Review: Albums|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=|issue=476|page=60|date=26 February 1997|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n \n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was produced in black and white [[silent film]] style. Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed in [[Derby]].\n\nIn the video, there are numerous elements of acting, cinematography and editing that suggest an old fashioned film style. The exaggerated gestures of the hat wearing woman, helpless and fearful, and those of her quick tempered lover hint at the acting style from 1920s [[Expressionism (film)|expressionist films]]. The ostensive [[metaphor]]s, such as the use of hypnosis on the woman by the man or the recurring shots of crossroad signs bearing names of romantic relationship related attitudes, remind of the 1920s and 1930s efforts to express [[subjectivism]] in film.\n\nThe use of circular masks, as to emphasise focal points or for a mere elegant look, also belongs to the aforementioned period. At the point where the woman first enters the man's bedroom and in the final rope scene, [[match cut]]s are used in a manner resemblant of that from silent experimental films. Mishra can be seen for brief moments on television screens in the background.\n\nThere is also a scene where the woman closes the door on the man's arm, as she tries to escape from his advances. This is a direct reference to scene from [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Luis Bu\u00f1uel's]] [[surrealism|surrealist]] film ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1928).\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Australia|2|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Austria|23|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Flanders|20|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Wallonia|7|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadatopsingles|4|chartid=3217|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|22|chartid=3232|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadadance|5|chartid=3233|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadarock|2|chartid=3188|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49|title=Billboard \u2013 Google Books|via=[[Google Books]]|date=12 April 1997|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-02-08.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=6|page=19|date=8 February 1997|access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n|11\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Finland|4|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|France|5|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Germany2|24|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|songid=3405|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-05-24.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|work=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://timarit.is/files/12413915.pdf#navpanes=1&view=FitH|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (NR. 209 Vikuna 20.2.

While being passed astern one of the boats broke the [[painter (rope)|painter]] and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to pull up to the ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy [[squall]].

About seven hours later they realised they could not make mainland, so they altered course for an island that could be seen in the distance.

[[British Museum]]]]\n\n[[Agriculture]] was the foundation of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] economy. Nearly 80% of the population  was involved in this activity.<ref>As estimated by L. Migeotte, ''L'\u00c9conomie des cit\u00e9s grecques'', p.&nbsp;55.</ref>\n\n== Agricultural products ==\n\n=== Farm ===\n[[Image:Noe 082.jpg|thumb|An ear of [[barley]], symbol of wealth in the city of [[Metapontum]] in [[Magna Graecia]] (i.e. the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colonies]] of [[southern Italy]]), stamped [[stater]], c.&nbsp;[[530 BCE|530]]\u2013[[510 BCE]]]]\n\nDuring the early time of [[History of Greece|Greek history]], as shown in the [[Odyssey]], Greek agriculture - and [[diet of Ancient Greece|diet]] - was based on cereals (''sitos'', though usually translated as ''wheat'', could in fact designate any type of cereal grain). In reality, 90% of cereal production was barley.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Even if the ancients were aware of the better nutritional value of wheat, the growing of barley was less demanding and more productive. Attempts have been made to calculate Attica grain production in the period, but results have not been conclusive.         \nIt did not take long for demand to outpace production capabilities, as  arable land was limited. The \"tightness\" of the land ({{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} / ''stenokh\u00f4r\u00eda'') also explains [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies .28apoikiai.29|Greek colonization]], and the importance [[Anatolia]]n [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]] would have for the Athenian empire in controlling grain provision.\n\nOn the other hand, the Greek land was well suited for [[olive]] trees, which provided [[olive oil]]. The growing of [[olive tree]]s dates back to early Greek history. Olive plantations are a long-term investment: it takes more than twenty years for the tree to provide fruit, and it only fruits every other year. [[Grape]]s also do well in the rocky soil, but demand a lot of care. Grapes have been grown since the [[Bronze age]].\n\nThese core crops were augmented by vegetable gardens ([[cabbage]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[lentils]], [[chick pea]], [[beans]]) and herb gardens ([[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[thyme]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[oregano]]). Orchards included those of [[ficus|fig]], [[almond]], apple, and pear trees.<ref>Signe Isager and Jens E. Skydsgaard, ''Ancient Greek Agriculture: An Introduction'', Routledge, 1995 ({{ISBN|0-415-11671-6}}) p.41</ref> [[Oilseed|Oil-seed]] plants such as [[linseed]], [[sesame]], and [[poppy seed|poppy]] were also grown. hi there\n\n=== Animal husbandry ===\n[[Image:Bronze billygoat Louvre Br197.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze [[billygoat]] found in the [[deme]] of [[Kifisia|Kephissia]], 5th century BCE, [[Louvre]]]]\n\n[[Animal husbandry]], seen as a sign of power and wealth in the works of [[Homer]], was in fact not well developed in ancient Greece. While the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] was familiar with the rearing of cattle, the practice was restricted as a result of geographic expansion into less suitable terrain. [[Goat]]s and [[sheep]] quickly became the most common livestock; less difficult to raise and providers of meat, [[wool]], and [[milk]] (usually in the form of [[chevre|cheese]]). [[Pork]] and [[poultry]] ([[chicken]] and [[geese]]) were also raised. Oxen were rare and normally used as a work animal, though they were occasionally used as sacrificial animals (see [[Hecatomb]]).  [[Donkeys]], [[mule]]s and their mixes were raised as pack or draught animals.\n\n[[Horse]]s were raised on the plains of [[Thessaly]] and [[Argolis]]; it was a luxury animal, signifying aristocracy. ''[[The Clouds]]'', [[Ancient Greek comedy]] by [[Aristophanes]], illustrates the equestrian snobbery of [[Athenian democracy|Athenian]] aristocrats: Pheidippides, the son of the hero is addicted to race-horses and so ruins his father Strepsiades.\n\nIt is likely that most farms practiced some limited animal husbandry; poultry or small animals grazing on waste land or fed kitchen scraps.  Combined farm/livestock operations also existed, as well as those specializing in livestock. An inscription<ref>Migeotte, Leopold. ''L'emprunt public dans les cit\u00e9s grecques. Recueil des documents et analyse critique'', Sphinx and Belles Lettres editions, Quebec-Paris, 1984.</ref> also mentions a certain Eubolos of [[Elateia]], in [[Phocis]], the owner of 220 head of cattle and horses and at least 1000 sheep and goats. Flocks of sheep were [[Transhumance|herded]] between the valley in winter and the mountains in summer. Taxes existed for the transit or stopover of flocks in cities.\n\n[[Cows]] were also sometimes raised, although they were not as common as other farm animals.\n\n=== Other products ===\n[[Wood]] was exploited, primarily for domestic use; homes and wagons were made of wood as was the [[ard (plough)|ard]] (''[[aratrum|aratron]]''). The Greek forests located in the highlands were denuded by goats and [[charcoal]] production; it was not long before it had to be imported especially for ship production (see [[trireme]]).\n\n[[Beekeeping]] provided honey, the only source of [[sugar]] known to the Greeks. It also was used in medicines and in the production of [[mead]]. The  Ancient Greeks did not have access to sugarcane. The [[Hymettus]] region of Attica was known for the quality of honey produced there.<ref>Strabo, Geography 9.1.23</ref> [[Beeswax|Wax]] was also produced, used in the [[lost-wax casting|lost wax process]] to produce bronze statues as well as in medicines.\n\n[[Bronze]] was used for farm tools and weaponry.\n\n== Agricultural work ==\n[[Image:Old olive tree in Karystos, Euboia, Greece.jpg|thumb|The olive; a foundation of Greek agriculture \u2014 here in [[Karystos]], [[Euboea]]]]\n\n[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'', 8th century BCE and [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Oeconomicus|Economy]]'' of the 4th century BCE provide information about working off the land.\n\nThe olive harvest took place from late autumn to the beginning of winter, either by hand or by pole. They were placed in wicker baskets and left to ferment for a few weeks before being pressed. The screw press, although referred to as the ''Greek press'' by [[Pliny the Elder]] (XVIII, 37) was a late (2nd century BCE) Roman invention. Oil was preserved in terra cotta vases for use later. This was also the time for pruning of trees and vines and harvesting of legumes.\n\nSpring was the rainy season; farmers took advantage of this to bring fallow ground back into production. They practised biennial [[crop rotation]], alternating from year to year between fallow and cultivated. Attempts to introduce triennial crop rotation with legumes in the third year, ran into problems due to the poor Greek soil, lack of power, and absence of mechanization. The Greeks did not use animal manure, possibly due to the low number of cattle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The only soil additive was weeds ploughed back into the ground after fields came out of fallow.\n\nIn summer, [[irrigation]] was indispensable. In June, they harvested with sickles; the scythe was not used. Wheat was threshed with animal power; it was trampled by oxen, donkeys or mules, and the grain stored. Women and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] ground it and made bread.\n\nIn early autumn, they collected deadfall and prepared supplies of firewood; while winters were mild on the coast they could be brutal in the highlands. Farmers also had to break the hard crust that had formed over the summer on grain fields. To do this required three passes since the [[Ard (plough)|ard]] was wooden (metal shares were rare) and only scratched the uppermost subsoil without inverting it. A hoe and mallet were also used to break clumps of earth. The fallow land for next year was sown by hand. This was the time of the grape harvest:  the grapes were crushed by foot in large vats, then the wine was left to ferment in jugs. After that process, people could drink the ambrosial wine and enjoy it.\n\n[[Image:NAMA Satyres & sil\u00e8nes.jpg|thumb|[[Satyr]]s making [[wine]], [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] [[bas-relief]] from altar of unknown date, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]\n\nIn the nearly four centuries that passed between Hesiod and Xenophon, no improvements can be found in agriculture. Tools remained mediocre and there were no inventions to lighten the work of either man or animal. It was not until the rise of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] that the [[water mill]] came into wide use, employing hydraulic power to augment muscle power. It took until the Middle Ages for true plows which turned the earth to be widely adopted. Neither irrigation, nor soil improvements, nor animal husbandry saw notable advances.  Only the very richest of land, such as that of [[Messinia]] was capable of supporting two crops per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n== Agricultural property ==\nWith the exception of [[Athens]], and a few areas where aerial surveys have permitted analysis of historical land distribution, agricultural property allocation is not well known.  Before the 5th century BCE, it is certain that the land belonged to great landowners, such as the [[Attica]]n [[Eupatrides]]. Nevertheless, land use varied regionally; in Attica domains were divided among smaller plots, whereas in [[Thessaly]] they had single tenants.\n\nFrom the 8th century BCE, tensions grew between the great landowners and the peasants, who were finding it more and more difficult to survive.  This can probably be explained by population growth brought on by reduced infant mortality, and aggravated by the practice of equally subdividing land amongst several inheritors each generation (attested to by both [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]).  In Athens, the crisis was resolved with the arrival of [[Solon]] in 594 BCE. He forbade [[Slavery in Ancient Greece#A specific case: slavery for debt|slavery for debt]] and introduced other measures intended to help the peasants.  In the 5th century BCE, the practice of ''liturgy'' ({{lang|grc| \u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}} / ''leitourgia'' - literally, \"public work\") placed the responsibility for provision of public services heavily on the shoulders of the rich, and led to a reduction in large scale land ownership.  It is estimated that most citizens of hoplite rank owned around 5 hectares of land.  In [[Sparta]], the reforms of [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]] led to a drastic redistribution of land, with 10 to 18 hectare lots (''kleroi'') distributed to each citizen. Elsewhere, [[tyrant]]s undertook redistributions of land seized from wealthy political enemies.\n\nFrom the 4th century BCE onwards property starts to become concentrated among few land owners, including in Sparta where according to [[Aristotle]], ''the land has passed into the hands of a few'' (''Politics'', II, 1270a).<ref>{{cite book|title=Aristotle in 23 Volumes |volume= 21, trans H.

The father of [[Demosthenes]] possessed 14 [[attic talent|talents]] and for land owned only a home, but he was the exception. When the banker [[Pasion]] made his fortune, he hurried to buy land.\n\nSome Greek land was public and/or sacred. Each city possessed such land and it is estimated that in Athens during the classical period these lands represented a tenth of cultivable land. This was an administrative division and the property of the city itself (for example in [[Attica]], it was a [[deme]]) or a temple. These lands were leased to individuals.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Diet of Ancient Greece]]\n* [[Economy of Ancient Greece]]\n* [[History of agriculture]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Marie-Claire Amouretti :\n** {{in lang|fr}} \"L'agriculture de la Gr\u00e8ce antique.

In reality, 90% of cereal production was barley.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Even if the ancients were aware of the better nutritional value of wheat, the growing of barley was less demanding and more productive. Attempts have been made to calculate Attica grain production in the period, but results have not been conclusive.         \nIt did not take long for demand to outpace production capabilities, as  arable land was limited. The \"tightness\" of the land ({{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}} / ''stenokh\u00f4r\u00eda'') also explains [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies .28apoikiai.29|Greek colonization]], and the importance [[Anatolia]]n [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]] would have for the Athenian empire in controlling grain provision.\n\nOn the other hand, the Greek land was well suited for [[olive]] trees, which provided [[olive oil]]. The growing of [[olive tree]]s dates back to early Greek history. Olive plantations are a long-term investment: it takes more than twenty years for the tree to provide fruit, and it only fruits every other year. [[Grape]]s also do well in the rocky soil, but demand a lot of care. Grapes have been grown since the [[Bronze age]].\n\nThese core crops were augmented by vegetable gardens ([[cabbage]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[lentils]], [[chick pea]], [[beans]]) and herb gardens ([[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[thyme]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[oregano]]).

C. (Michael Charles)|isbn=1-85573-839-2|location=Boca Raton|oclc=56123328}}</ref> The objective of the feed system is to spread products into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system \u2014 usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products, like whole potatoes \u2014 pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while the good product continues along its normal trajectory.\n\nThe ideal sorter to use depends on the application. Therefore, the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determine the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.\n\n== Sensors ==\nOptical sorters require a combination of lights and sensors to illuminate and capture images of the objects so the images can be processed. The processed images will determine if the material should be accepted or rejected.\n\nThere are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of the two on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[Spectrum|spectrums]]. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]]\n=== Cameras ===\nMonochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.\n\nSophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.\n\nCoupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape; as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object.\n\n=== Lasers ===\nWhile cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to distinguish a material's structural properties along with their color. This structural property inspection allows lasers to detect a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic; even if they are the same color as the good product.\n\nLasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light; whether on the visible spectrum or beyond.<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Scattered/transmitted light information system|gdate=1992-09-30|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1993007468A1/en}}</ref> For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths; which is a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|last2=Lu|first2=Hongfei|last3=Zheng|first3=Yueping|last4=Lou|first4=Heqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Cuiqin|date=2010-12-01|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. \u2018hongxing\u2019) using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=101|issue=4|pages=402\u2013408|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|issn=0260-8774}}</ref>\n\n=== Camera/Laser Combinations ===\nSorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal.[[File:Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips shows invisible defects]]\n=== Hyperspectral Imaging ===\nDriven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html|title=StackPath|website=www.vision-systems.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nLike trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].\n\n== Software Driven Intelligence ==\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing is used to manipulate the raw data. The image processing extracts and categorizes information about specific features. The user then defines accept/reject thresholds that are used to determine what is good and bad in the raw data flow. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products. When used to control the sorter's ejection system, it can improve the accuracy of ejecting defective products. This improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n== Platforms ==\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product \u2013 large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize \u2013 and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\n=== Channel sorters ===\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard, and dry with a consistent size and shape; such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that cannot be handled by a channel sorter \u2013 such as soft, wet, or nonhomogeneous products \u2013 and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed, sorters or belt sorters are more ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties, and chemical composition.\n\n=== Freefall and Chute-fed sorters ===\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall and chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point and lower maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n=== Belt Sorters ===\n[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]]\nBelt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying. The products are often stabilized on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect products from above the belt, while other sorters also send products off of the belt for an in-air inspection. These sorters can either be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or three-way sorting if two ejector systems with three outfeed streams are equipped.\n=== ADR Systems ===\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. The combination of an ADR system followed by a mechanical nubbin grader is another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\n=== Single-file Inspection Systems ===\nThe platforms described above all operate with materials in bulk; meaning they do not need the materials to be in a single-file to be inspected. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. These sorters are effective in removing foreign objects based on differences in size, shape and color. They are not as popular as the other platforms due to decreased efficiency. \n\n=== Mechanical Graders ===\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems are used because sensors and image processing software is not necessary.These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n== Practical Usage ==\n\n=== Waste and Recycling ===\nOptical sorting machines can be used to identify and discard manufacturing waste, such as metals, drywall, cardboard, and various plastics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/typical-wastes-generated-industry-sectors|title=Typical Wastes Generated by Industry Sectors|last=US EPA|first=OLEM|date=2015-05-26|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> In the metal industry, optical sorting machines are used to discard plastics, glass, wood, and other non-needed metals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mssoptical.com/service/optical-sorting-innovation/|title=Optical Sorting Applications And Sorting Machines {{!}} MSS|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The plastic industry uses optical sorting machines to not only discard various materials like those listed, but also different types of plastics.

Therefore, the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determine the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.\n\n== Sensors ==\nOptical sorters require a combination of lights and sensors to illuminate and capture images of the objects so the images can be processed. The processed images will determine if the material should be accepted or rejected.\n\nThere are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of the two on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[Spectrum|spectrums]]. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]]\n=== Cameras ===\nMonochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.\n\nSophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.\n\nCoupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape; as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object.\n\n=== Lasers ===\nWhile cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to distinguish a material's structural properties along with their color. This structural property inspection allows lasers to detect a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic; even if they are the same color as the good product.\n\nLasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light; whether on the visible spectrum or beyond.<ref>{{Cite patent|title=Scattered/transmitted light information system|gdate=1992-09-30|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1993007468A1/en}}</ref> For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths; which is a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|last2=Lu|first2=Hongfei|last3=Zheng|first3=Yueping|last4=Lou|first4=Heqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Cuiqin|date=2010-12-01|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. \u2018hongxing\u2019) using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=101|issue=4|pages=402\u2013408|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|issn=0260-8774}}</ref>\n\n=== Camera/laser combinations ===\nSorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal.[[File:Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of \"sugar end\" potato strips shows invisible defects]]\n=== Hyperspectral imaging ===\nDriven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html|title=StackPath|website=www.vision-systems.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\nLike trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].\n\n== Software Driven Intelligence ==\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing is used to manipulate the raw data. The image processing extracts and categorizes information about specific features. The user then defines accept/reject thresholds that are used to determine what is good and bad in the raw data flow. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products. When used to control the sorter's ejection system, it can improve the accuracy of ejecting defective products. This improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n== Platforms ==\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product \u2013 large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize \u2013 and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\n=== Channel sorters[edit] ===\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard, and dry with a consistent size and shape; such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that cannot be handled by a channel sorter \u2013 such as soft, wet, or nonhomogeneous products \u2013 and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed, sorters or belt sorters are more ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties, and chemical composition.\n\n=== Freefall and chute-fed sorters[edit] ===\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall and chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point and lower maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n=== Belt Sorters[edit] ===\n[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]]\nBelt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying. The products are often stabilized on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect products from above the belt, while other sorters also send products off of the belt for an in-air inspection. These sorters can either be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or three-way sorting if two ejector systems with three outfeed streams are equipped.\n=== ADR systems[edit] ===\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. The combination of an ADR system followed by a mechanical nubbin grader is another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\n=== Single-file inspection systems[edit] ===\nThe platforms described above all operate with materials in bulk; meaning they do not need the materials to be in a single-file to be inspected. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. These sorters are effective in removing foreign objects based on differences in size, shape and color. They are not as popular as the other platforms due to decreased efficiency. \n\n=== Mechanical graders[edit] ===\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems are used because sensors and image processing software is not necessary.These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n== Practical Usage ==\n\n=== Waste and Recycling ===\nOptical sorting machines can be used to identify and discard manufacturing waste, such as metals, drywall, cardboard, and various plastics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/typical-wastes-generated-industry-sectors|title=Typical Wastes Generated by Industry Sectors|last=US EPA|first=OLEM|date=2015-05-26|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> In the metal industry, optical sorting machines are used to discard plastics, glass, wood, and other non-needed metals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mssoptical.com/service/optical-sorting-innovation/|title=Optical Sorting Applications And Sorting Machines {{!}} MSS|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The plastic industry uses optical sorting machines to not only discard various materials like those listed, but also different types of plastics.
