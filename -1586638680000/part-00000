Boston-born Roud was 33 years old at the time and based in London where he worked as a film critic for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and programmed the London Film Festival. Though Roud maintained his home base in London, he recruited Amos Vogel of the legendary [[Cinema 16]] film club as his New York-based co-programmer. The first edition of the festival opened on September 10, 1963 with [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]''. In 1966, Roud and Vogel formed the festival's first selection committee, consisting of Arthur Knight and [[Andrew Sarris]]; [[Susan Sontag]] was added the next year. Vogel resigned from his position as Festival Director in 1968. Though Roud was previously designated Program Director, he presided over the festival from 1969 to 1987.\n\nRoud's 25 years at the festival were characterized by a focus on the European art cinema of the postwar years and the rise of auteurism.<ref>Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). \"Breaking the Waves\". Film Comment.</ref>\n\n===The Richard Pe\u00f1a era===\n\nRichard Pe\u00f1a, then 34, took over as lead programmer in 1988. The Queens native was already an accomplished film historian, academic, and programmer. Prior to his work with NYFF, he worked at the Film Center of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Pe\u00f1a came to NYFF as a seasoned festival-goer who held Roud in high esteem. During his stint as programmer (which also listed 25 years), Pe\u00f1a honored the festival's traditions and unique character - retaining the selection committee process, the non-competitive format, the post-screening director Q&As, and the festival's strict selectivity - while also working to expand NYFF's somewhat Eurocentric focus. Filmmakers like [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Leos Carax]], [[Ra\u00fal Ruiz (director)|Ra\u00fal Ruiz]], and [[Krzystof Kieslowski]] were introduced to NYFF audiences during the Roud era, and became regulars under Pe\u00f1a. After 25 years as Program Director and head of the NYFF selection committee, Pe\u00f1a led his final year at NYFF in 2012, during the festival's 50th presentation.<ref>Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). \"Breaking the Waves\".

Jones began his programming career at Film Forum and the Rotterdam Film Festival, before joining The Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1998 as Associate Director of Programming and a member of the NYFF programming committee.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/ New York Film Festival] Official website (2016)\n*[https://www.filmlinc.org Film Society of Lincoln Center] Presenting organization website\n*{{NYTtopic|subjects/n/new_york_film_festival}}\n\n{{New York Film Festival}}\n[[Category:1963 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Experimental film festivals]]\n[[Category:Film festivals established in 1963]]\n[[Category:Film festivals in New York City]]\n[[Category:Lincoln Center]]\n[[Category:New York Film Festival| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Annual film festival held every autumn in New York City}}\n{{Infobox film festival\n|name=New York Film Festival\n|logo=New York Film Festival logo.png\n|founded=1963\n|location=[[New York City]], [[United States]]\n|host=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]\n|website=[https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2019/ filmlinc.org/nyff2019 (2019)]}}\n\nThe '''New York Film Festival''' ('''NYFF''') is an annual [[film festival]] held every autumn in [[New York City]], presented by the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] ('''FSLC''').

The first edition of the festival opened on September 10, 1963 with [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]''. In 1966, Roud and Vogel formed the festival's first selection committee, consisting of Arthur Knight and [[Andrew Sarris]]; [[Susan Sontag]] was added the next year. Vogel resigned from his position as Festival Director in 1968. Though Roud was previously designated Program Director, he presided over the festival from 1969 to 1987.\n\nRoud's 25 years at the festival were characterized by a focus on the European art cinema of the postwar years and the rise of auteurism.<ref>Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). \"Breaking the Waves\". Film Comment.</ref>\n\n===The Richard Pe\u00f1a era===\n\nRichard Pe\u00f1a, then 34, took over as lead programmer in 1988. The Queens native was already an accomplished film historian, academic, and programmer. Prior to his work with NYFF, he worked at the Film Center of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Pe\u00f1a came to NYFF as a seasoned festival-goer who held Roud in high esteem. During his stint as programmer (which also listed 25 years), Pe\u00f1a honored the festival's traditions and unique character - retaining the selection committee process, the non-competitive format, the post-screening director Q&As, and the festival's strict selectivity - while also working to expand NYFF's somewhat Eurocentric focus. Filmmakers like [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Leos Carax]], [[Ra\u00fal Ruiz (director)|Ra\u00fal Ruiz]], and [[Krzystof Kieslowski]] were introduced to NYFF audiences during the Roud era, and became regulars under Pe\u00f1a. After 25 years as Program Director and head of the NYFF selection committee, Pe\u00f1a led his final year at NYFF in 2012, during the festival's 50th presentation.<ref>Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). \"Breaking the Waves\". Film Comment.</ref>\n\n===NYFF today===\n\nAfter Richard Pe\u00f1a's departure, Robert Koehler briefly took over year-round programming duties, while Kent Jones, who left The [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] in 2009 to serve as Executive Director of the [[World Cinema Foundation]], returned to lead NYFF. Jones began his programming career at Film Forum and the Rotterdam Film Festival, before joining The Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1998 as Associate Director of Programming and a member of the NYFF programming committee.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.filmlinc.org/nyff2016/ New York Film Festival] Official website (2016)\n*[https://www.filmlinc.org Film Society of Lincoln Center] Presenting organization website\n*{{NYTtopic|subjects/n/new_york_film_festival}}\n\n{{New York Film Festival}}\n[[Category:1963 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Experimental film festivals]]\n[[Category:Film festivals established in 1963]]\n[[Category:Film festivals in New York City]]\n[[Category:Lincoln Center]]\n[[Category:New York Film Festival| ]]\n", "name_user": "Headhitter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSpecial Events:l.c.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Festival"}

[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. Nc3|Nc3]] \nThis fairly uncommon opening may have more names than any other:  it is also called the '''Heinrichsen Opening''', '''Baltic Opening''', '''Van Geet Opening''', '''Sleipnir Opening''', '''Kotr\u010d's Opening''', '''Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Opening''', '''Romanian Opening''', '''Queen's Knight Attack''', '''Queen's Knight Opening''', '''Millard's Opening''', '''Knight on the Left''', and (in German) '''der Linksspringer'''.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n==Origin of names==\nThe names Heinrichsen and Baltic derive from [[Lithuania]]n chess player Arved Heinrichsen (1876&ndash;1900).  The opening was analyzed and played by the [[New York (state)|New York]] master Ted A. Dunst (April 11, 1907 [[New York City]] &ndash; December 18, 1985 [[Lambertville, New Jersey]]), giving the opening its most popular name in the United States.  The Dutch [[International Master]] and [[correspondence chess|correspondence]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Dirk Daniel (\"Dick D.\") van Geet (March 1, 1932 \u2013 April 29, 2012) frequently played 1.Nc3, so it is often called the Van Geet Opening in the [[Netherlands]].  The appellation [[Sleipnir]] seems to come from [[Germany]].  Sleipnir is [[Odin]]'s (''Wotan'' in German) magical eight-legged horse, and chess [[knight (chess)|knights]] are horses with up to eight different possible moves each turn. [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] Jan Kotr\u010d (1862\u20131943), editor and publisher of the magazine ''\u010cesk\u00e9 Listy'', said the opening was analyzed by [[England|English]] players. Zvonimir Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (b. October 17, 1944) is a [[Slovenia]]n International Master who often adopts this opening. [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]] refers to it as the \"Queen's Knight Attack\" {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=8}}. [[Chess master|National Master]] [[Hugh Myers]] called it \"Millard's Opening\" after Henry Millard (1824\u201391), a blind [[correspondence chess]] player who drew with the opening in a [[List of chess terms#Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous exhibition]] against [[Joseph Henry Blackburne]]. Blackburne later played the opening himself against [[Josef Noa]] in the London 1883 international chess tournament {{harvcol|Myers|2002|pp=24\u201325}}.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001989 Blackburne\u2013Noa, London 1883]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref> The German [[FIDE Master]] Harald Keilhack in his 2005 book on the opening states that it has also been referred to as the Romanian Defense, and that he prefers the neutral appellation \"Der Linksspringer\" or, in English, \"the Knight on the Left\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=7}}.\n\n==General remarks==\nThe opening move 1.Nc3 develops the [[knight (chess)|knight]] to a good square where it attacks the central e4 and d5 squares.  Although quite playable, 1.Nc3 is rarely seen; it is only the eighth most popular of the 20 possible first moves, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.g3, 1.f4, and 1.b3. As of February 6, 2009, out of the over 500,000 games in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, only 644&mdash;about 1 out of every 780&mdash;begins with 1.Nc3.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\">[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/explorer Opening Explorer]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref>  The third-ranking 1.Nf3 is 66 times as popular.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> Some very strong [[correspondence chess]] players employ 1.Nc3 frequently, and it is occasionally seen over-the-board.\n\nThe reasons for 1.Nc3's lack of popularity are that it does not stop Black from occupying the center (while 1.Nf3 prevents 1...e5, 1.Nc3 does not prevent 1...d5 because the d-pawn is guarded by the queen), and it blocks White's c-pawn from moving, thus making it impossible to play c3 or c4 (which are often desirable moves) without moving the knight first. In addition, after 1...d5, the knight's position is unstable because Black may attack it with ...d4. Although 1.Nc3 develops a piece to a good square (unlike 1.Na3 or 1.Nh3), and does not weaken White's position (unlike, e.g., 1.g4 or 1.f3) or waste time (unlike, e.g., 1. c3), the above-stated drawbacks make it an inferior way of attempting to exploit White's [[First-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. Of the 644 games with 1.Nc3 in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, White won 34.8%, drew 23.9%, and lost 41.3%, for a total winning percentage of only 46.75%.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/><ref>White's overall winning percentage is derived by taking the percentage of games won by White and adding half of the percentage of drawn games, in this case 34.8 plus half of 23.9.</ref> White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%).<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> However, as of October 2018, for the 38,043 games with 1.Nc3 in [[Lichess.org]]'s database, White has a total winning percentage of 57.25% (55% won, 5% drawn, 40% lost), although it is still only the tenth most popular first move for White.\n\n==Possible continuations==\n\n===1...d5===\nThis is one of Black's best replies, occupying the center and underscoring the unsettled position of White's knight. White can prevent 2...d4 by playing 2.d4 himself, but he then obtains a somewhat inflexible position in the [[Queen's Pawn Game]] with his knight blocking the c-pawn {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. Also possible is 2.Nf3 (and if 2...d4, 3.Ne4), a sort of [[Black Knights' Tango]] with an extra move {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=10}}. A third line is 2.e3, which Keilhack calls \"the M\u00fcller game,\" when White hopes for 2...e5 (other moves are also playable, of course) 3.Qh5!?, e.g. 3...Nc6 4.Bb5 Qd6 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Nf6 7.Qe5+! Be6?! (Keilhack recommends 7...Kd8!! 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nf3 Bg4) 8.Bf4 0-0-0 9.Bxc6 Qxc6? 10.Nb5!, when White wins at least a pawn {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=307\u201311}}.\n\nWhite's most common response to 1...d5 is 2.e4. This is the same position as 1.e4 d5 2.Nc3, an obscure branch of the [[Scandinavian Defense#Alternatives to 2.exd5|Scandinavian Defense]]. Black has five plausible responses to 2.e4: 2...e6 and 2...c6 transpose to the [[French Defence|French]] and [[Caro-Kann Defense|Caro\u2013Kann]] Defenses, and 2...Nf6 to a variation of [[Alekhine's Defence]]. The move 2...d4 gives Black a [[List of chess terms#Spatial advantage|spatial advantage]], which White may work to undermine along the lines of [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernism]]. Keilhack writes, \"2...d4 is chosen either by somewhat naive players who are attracted by the fact that Black wins time and space ... or by strong players who are aware of the strategic risks but are striving for a complex battle.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}} He considers the Van Geet Attack, 2...d4 3.Nce2 followed by Ng3, to be \"the core of the 1.Nc3 opening,\" \"a fully independent entity which strives for early knight activity on the kingside,\" usually with Ng3, Nf3, Bc4 or Bb5, 0-0, and d3 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}}. Alternative lines for White include the unusual 3.Nb1!?, with which van Geet once drew [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], and, after 3.Nce2, playing a sort of [[King's Indian Attack]] with d3, g3, Bg2, f4, Nf3, and 0-0 \u2013 a line Keilhack calls the \"Lizard Attack\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=125}}.\n\nThe fifth alternative, 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4, leads to more open play. After 3.Nxe4, Black has a number of playable moves, including 3...e5, 3...Nc6, 3...Bf5, 3...Nd7, 3...Nf6, and even 3...Qd5!?, when 4.Nc3 transposes to the [[Scandinavian Defense]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=131, 144, 146, 158, 172, 176}}. After 3...e5, White's thematic move is 4.Bc4, when several of Black's plausible moves lead to disaster, e.g. 4...Be7? 5.Qh5! and White wins at least a pawn after 5...g6 6.Qxe5 or 5...Nh6 6.d3; or 4...Nf6? 5.Ng5! Nd5 and now 6.d4!, 6.Qf3!, and 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qf3+ are all possible, with positions similar to the line of the [[Two Knights Defense]] beginning 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5?! {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=133\u201334}}. However, 3...e5 4.Bc4 Nc6! is playable {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=135\u201343}}.\n\nInternational Master Richard Palliser, in his 2006 book ''Beating Unusual Chess Openings'', recommends 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nxe4 Nd7 for Black. He explains, \"Black doesn't attempt to refute White's opening or to gain lots of space (as with 2...d4), but simply settles for sensible development. The position should be compared to both a [[Caro-Kann Defense]] and a French Rubinstein. Black will hope to demonstrate that he has gained from the omission of an early ...c6 or ...e6, while White will generally omit d4, preferring a setup with Bc4 and d3\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=143}}. After 4.Bc4, the natural move 4...Ngf6!? leads to very sharp and unclear play if White responds with 5.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 6.Ng5+ Kg8 7.Ne6 Qe8 8.Nxc7 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=158\u201363}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201346}}. More solid is 4...e6 (\"!\" \u2013 Keilhack) {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=164\u201370}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201348}}.\n\n===1...c5===\n1...c5 is often played by devotees of the [[Sicilian Defence]], into which the game often transposes, either immediately after 2.e4 or at a later point.  Alternatively, White can remain in independent 1.Nc3 lines, at least for the time being, with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4, which gives Black a large choice of possible responses. One line Palliser recommends for Black is 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 (3.e4 transposes to a Sicilian) cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5!? (seizing the center) 5.Bg5 Nbd7! 6.e4 (more critical than the passive 6.e3?!) dxe4 7.Qe2 e6!? 8.0-0-0 Be7 9.Nxe4 0-0 when \"White doesn't appear to have any advantage\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=154\u201356}}.\n\nIf White chooses to transpose to standard Sicilian lines, the fact that his knight is committed to c3 may be a disadvantage in certain lines. The Closed Sicilian, commonly reached by 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, without an early d4 by White, gives Black few [[chess theory|theoretical difficulties]] {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=346}}. If White instead chooses to play an Open Sicilian with 2.e4 and 3.Nf3 or Nge2, followed by d4, the knight's placement on c3 prevents White from playing the [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] with c4. This makes the [[Sicilian Defence, Accelerated Dragon|Accelerated Dragon Variation]] with 2...Nc6 and 3...g6 particularly attractive {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|p=146}}. Black may also stop White's intended d4 by playing an early ...e5, e.g. 1.Nc3 c5 2.e4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=151\u201355}} or 3.Nge2 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=148\u201351}}.\n\n===1...Nf6===\n[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Kaufman]] recommends 1...Nf6, intending to meet 2.e4 with 2...e5 or 2.d4 with 2...d5 {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|p=484}}. Keilhack writes that \"1...Nf6 is one of the most unpleasant replies for the 1.Nc3 player. Black keeps all options open, he can choose between a central (...d5, possibly followed by ...c5) and an Indian (...g6, ...Bg7) setup. ... Among the many possible [second] moves [for White], none really stands out.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=338}}. The most straightforward moves for White are 2.d4 and 2.e4, but neither promises White a significant advantage. After 2.d4, 2...d5 leads to the [[Richter-Veresov Attack]] (3.Bg5) or another type of [[Queen's Pawn Game]] where White, having blocked his c-pawn, has little chance for advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. After 2.e4, Black can again play 2...d5 with a type of Alekhine's Defense; or 2...d6 3.d4 g6 with a [[Pirc Defense]] or 3...e5 with a [[Philidor's Defense]]. The most solid response to 2.e4 is 2...e5, leading to a [[Vienna Game]] or, after 3.Nf3 Nc6, to a [[Four Knights Game]]\u2014neither of which offers White an appreciable advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=364\u201365}} {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=121}}. Keilhack also analyzes a number of offbeat possibilities, including 2.b3, 2.Nf3, 2.f4 (an unusual form of [[Bird's Opening]] that Keilhack calls the \"Aasum System\"), 2.g3, and even the gambit 2.g4?! Palliser writes that none of the alternatives to 2.e4 \"really convince or should greatly trouble Black over the board\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=142}}.\n\n===1...e5===\nThis natural move is playable, but dangerous if Black does not know what he is doing. One of the main lines is 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4, with poor chances for Black, continued by 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5. Keilhack writes that this variation \"occurs rather often and offers excellent chances for an early knockout\" by White and that \"only two [moves] (5...Bb4 and 5...Bc5) do not immediately ruin Black's game\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=26}}. (See, e.g., the Dunst\u2013Gresser game given below.)\n\n==Transpositions to other openings==\nThe move 1.Nc3 is considered an [[Irregular openings (chess)|irregular opening]], so it is classified under the A00 code in the [[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]] (also see [[List of chess openings]]).  [[Transposition (chess)|Transpositions]] to more common openings are possible, many of which are discussed in the preceding section.  In addition, 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 reaches a position in the Scandinavian Defense; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.e4 leads to a [[Four Knights Game|Scotch Four Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e4 Bc5 or 3...g6 gives a [[Three Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 Nc6 2.d4 d5 3.e4, or 2...e5 and now 3.d5 Nce7 4.e4 or 3.dxe5 Nxe5 4.e4, yields a [[Nimzowitsch Defense]]; and 1.Nc3 b6 2.e4 Bb7 3.d4 is an [[Owen's Defense]]. Transposition to a [[Dutch Defense]] is also possible after 1.Nc3 f5 2.d4, but Keilhack considers 2.e4! more dangerous, intending 2...fxe4 3.d3, a reversed [[From's Gambit]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=369\u201370}}. Black alternatives to 2...fxe4 include 2...d6, when 3.d4 transposes to the [[Balogh Defense]]; and 2...e5?!, when 3.Nf3 produces a [[Latvian Gambit]], but 3.exf5!, as in a game between [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Sam Loyd]], may be stronger.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1228240 Steinitz\u2013Loyd, London 1867]</ref>\n\n==Sample games==\n*Here is a quick victory by Dunst himself against nine-time U.S. Women's Champion [[Gisela Gresser]].

[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. Nc3|Nc3]] \nThis fairly uncommon opening may have more names than any other:  it is also called the '''Heinrichsen Opening''', '''Baltic Opening''', '''Van Geet Opening''', '''Sleipnir Opening''', '''Kotr\u010d's Opening''', '''Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Opening''', '''Romanian Opening''', '''Queen's Knight Attack''', '''Queen's Knight Opening''', '''Millard's Opening''', '''Knight on the Left''', and (in German) '''der Linksspringer'''.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n==Origin of names==\nThe names Heinrichsen and Baltic derive from [[Lithuania]]n chess player Arved Heinrichsen (1876&ndash;1900).  The opening was analyzed and played by the [[New York (state)|New York]] master Ted A. Dunst (April 11, 1907 [[New York City]] &ndash; December 18, 1985 [[Lambertville, New Jersey]]), giving the opening its most popular name in the United States.  The Dutch [[International Master]] and [[correspondence chess|correspondence]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Dirk Daniel (\"Dick D.\") van Geet (March 1, 1932 \u2013 April 29, 2012) frequently played 1.Nc3, so it is often called the Van Geet Opening in the [[Netherlands]].  The appellation [[Sleipnir]] seems to come from [[Germany]].  Sleipnir is [[Odin]]'s (''Wotan'' in German) magical eight-legged horse, and chess [[knight (chess)|knights]] are horses with up to eight different possible moves each turn. [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] Jan Kotr\u010d (1862\u20131943), editor and publisher of the magazine ''\u010cesk\u00e9 Listy'', said the opening was analyzed by [[England|English]] players. Zvonimir Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (b. October 17, 1944) is a [[Slovenia]]n International Master who often adopts this opening. [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]] refers to it as the \"Queen's Knight Attack\" {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=8}}. [[Chess master|National Master]] [[Hugh Myers]] called it \"Millard's Opening\" after Henry Millard (1824\u201391), a blind [[correspondence chess]] player who drew with the opening in a [[List of chess terms#Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous exhibition]] against [[Joseph Henry Blackburne]]. Blackburne later played the opening himself against [[Josef Noa]] in the London 1883 international chess tournament {{harvcol|Myers|2002|pp=24\u201325}}.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001989 Blackburne\u2013Noa, London 1883]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref> The German [[FIDE Master]] Harald Keilhack in his 2005 book on the opening states that it has also been referred to as the Romanian Defense, and that he prefers the neutral appellation \"Der Linksspringer\" or, in English, \"the Knight on the Left\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=7}}.\n\n==General remarks==\nThe opening move 1.Nc3 develops the [[knight (chess)|knight]] to a good square where it attacks the central e4 and d5 squares.  Although quite playable, 1.Nc3 is rarely seen; it is only the eighth most popular of the 20 possible first moves, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.g3, 1.f4, and 1.b3. As of February 6, 2009, out of the over 500,000 games in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, only 644&mdash;about 1 out of every 780&mdash;begins with 1.Nc3.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\">[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/explorer Opening Explorer]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref>  The third-ranking 1.Nf3 is 66 times as popular.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> Some very strong [[correspondence chess]] players employ 1.Nc3 frequently, and it is occasionally seen over-the-board.\n\nThe reasons for 1.Nc3's lack of popularity are that it does not stop Black from occupying the center (while 1.Nf3 prevents 1...e5, 1.Nc3 does not prevent 1...d5 because the d-pawn is guarded by the queen), and it blocks White's c-pawn from moving, thus making it impossible to play c3 or c4 (which are often desirable moves) without moving the knight first. In addition, after 1...d5, the knight's position is unstable because Black may attack it with ...d4. Although 1.Nc3 develops a piece to a good square (unlike 1.Na3 or 1.Nh3), and does not weaken White's position (unlike, e.g., 1.g4 or 1.f3) or waste time (unlike, e.g., 1. c3), the above-stated drawbacks make it an inferior way of attempting to exploit White's [[First-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. Of the 644 games with 1.Nc3 in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, White won 34.8%, drew 23.9%, and lost 41.3%, for a total winning percentage of only 46.75%.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/><ref>White's overall winning percentage is derived by taking the percentage of games won by White and adding half of the percentage of drawn games, in this case 34.8 plus half of 23.9.</ref> White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%).<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> However, as of October 2018, for the 38,043 games with 1.Nc3 in [[Lichess.org]]'s database, White has a total winning percentage of 57.25% (55% won, 5% drawn, 40% lost), although it is still only the tenth most popular first move for White.\n\n==Possible continuations==\n\n===1...d5===\nThis is one of Black's best replies, occupying the center and underscoring the unsettled position of White's knight. White can prevent 2...d4 by playing 2.d4 himself, but he then obtains a somewhat inflexible position in the [[Queen's Pawn Game]] with his knight blocking the c-pawn {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. Also possible is 2.Nf3 (and if 2...d4, 3.Ne4), a sort of [[Black Knights' Tango]] with an extra move {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=10}}. A third line is 2.e3, which Keilhack calls \"the M\u00fcller game,\" when White hopes for 2...e5 (other moves are also playable, of course) 3.Qh5!?, e.g. 3...Nc6 4.Bb5 Qd6 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Nf6 7.Qe5+! Be6?! (Keilhack recommends 7...Kd8!! 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nf3 Bg4) 8.Bf4 0-0-0 9.Bxc6 Qxc6? 10.Nb5!, when White wins at least a pawn {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=307\u201311}}.\n\nWhite's most common response to 1...d5 is 2.e4. This is the same position as 1.e4 d5 2.Nc3, an obscure branch of the [[Scandinavian Defense#Alternatives to 2.exd5|Scandinavian Defense]]. Black has five plausible responses to 2.e4: 2...e6 and 2...c6 transpose to the [[French Defence|French]] and [[Caro-Kann Defense|Caro\u2013Kann]] Defenses, and 2...Nf6 to a variation of [[Alekhine's Defence]]. The move 2...d4 gives Black a [[List of chess terms#Spatial advantage|spatial advantage]], which White may work to undermine along the lines of [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernism]]. Keilhack writes, \"2...d4 is chosen either by somewhat naive players who are attracted by the fact that Black wins time and space ... or by strong players who are aware of the strategic risks but are striving for a complex battle.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}} He considers the Van Geet Attack, 2...d4 3.Nce2 followed by Ng3, to be \"the core of the 1.Nc3 opening,\" \"a fully independent entity which strives for early knight activity on the kingside,\" usually with Ng3, Nf3, Bc4 or Bb5, 0-0, and d3 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}}. Alternative lines for White include the unusual 3.Nb1!?, with which van Geet once drew [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], and, after 3.Nce2, playing a sort of [[King's Indian Attack]] with d3, g3, Bg2, f4, Nf3, and 0-0 \u2013 a line Keilhack calls the \"Lizard Attack\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=125}}.\n\nThe fifth alternative, 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4, leads to more open play. After 3.Nxe4, Black has a number of playable moves, including 3...e5, 3...Nc6, 3...Bf5, 3...Nd7, 3...Nf6, and even 3...Qd5!?, when 4.Nc3 transposes to the [[Scandinavian Defense]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=131, 144, 146, 158, 172, 176}}. After 3...e5, White's thematic move is 4.Bc4, when several of Black's plausible moves lead to disaster, e.g. 4...Be7? 5.Qh5! and White wins at least a pawn after 5...g6 6.Qxe5 or 5...Nh6 6.d3; or 4...Nf6? 5.Ng5! Nd5 and now 6.d4!, 6.Qf3!, and 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qf3+ are all possible, with positions similar to the line of the [[Two Knights Defense]] beginning 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5?! {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=133\u201334}}. However, 3...e5 4.Bc4 Nc6! is playable {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=135\u201343}}.\n\nInternational Master Richard Palliser, in his 2006 book ''Beating Unusual Chess Openings'', recommends 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nxe4 Nd7 for Black. He explains, \"Black doesn't attempt to refute White's opening or to gain lots of space (as with 2...d4), but simply settles for sensible development. The position should be compared to both a [[Caro-Kann Defense]] and a French Rubinstein. Black will hope to demonstrate that he has gained from the omission of an early ...c6 or ...e6, while White will generally omit d4, preferring a setup with Bc4 and d3\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=143}}. After 4.Bc4, the natural move 4...Ngf6!? leads to very sharp and unclear play if White responds with 5.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 6.Ng5+ Kg8 7.Ne6 Qe8 8.Nxc7 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=158\u201363}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201346}}. More solid is 4...e6 (\"!\" \u2013 Keilhack) {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=164\u201370}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201348}}.\n\n===1...c5===\n1...c5 is often played by devotees of the [[Sicilian Defence]], into which the game often transposes, either immediately after 2.e4 or at a later point.  Alternatively, White can remain in independent 1.Nc3 lines, at least for the time being, with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4, which gives Black a large choice of possible responses. One line Palliser recommends for Black is 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 (3.e4 transposes to a Sicilian) cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5!? (seizing the center) 5.Bg5 Nbd7! 6.e4 (more critical than the passive 6.e3?!) dxe4 7.Qe2 e6!? 8.0-0-0 Be7 9.Nxe4 0-0 when \"White doesn't appear to have any advantage\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=154\u201356}}.\n\nIf White chooses to transpose to standard Sicilian lines, the fact that his knight is committed to c3 may be a disadvantage in certain lines. The Closed Sicilian, commonly reached by 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, without an early d4 by White, gives Black few [[chess theory|theoretical difficulties]] {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=346}}. If White instead chooses to play an Open Sicilian with 2.e4 and 3.Nf3 or Nge2, followed by d4, the knight's placement on c3 prevents White from playing the [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] with c4. This makes the [[Sicilian Defence, Accelerated Dragon|Accelerated Dragon Variation]] with 2...Nc6 and 3...g6 particularly attractive {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|p=146}}. Black may also stop White's intended d4 by playing an early ...e5, e.g. 1.Nc3 c5 2.e4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=151\u201355}} or 3.Nge2 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=148\u201351}}.\n\n===1...Nf6===\n[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Kaufman]] recommends 1...Nf6, intending to meet 2.e4 with 2...e5 or 2.d4 with 2...d5 {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|p=484}}. Keilhack writes that \"1...Nf6 is one of the most unpleasant replies for the 1.Nc3 player. Black keeps all options open, he can choose between a central (...d5, possibly followed by ...c5) and an Indian (...g6, ...Bg7) setup. ... Among the many possible [second] moves [for White], none really stands out.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=338}}. The most straightforward moves for White are 2.d4 and 2.e4, but neither promises White a significant advantage. After 2.d4, 2...d5 leads to the [[Richter-Veresov Attack]] (3.Bg5) or another type of [[Queen's Pawn Game]] where White, having blocked his c-pawn, has little chance for advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. After 2.e4, Black can again play 2...d5 with a type of Alekhine's Defense; or 2...d6 3.d4 g6 with a [[Pirc Defense]] or 3...e5 with a [[Philidor's Defense]]. The most solid response to 2.e4 is 2...e5, leading to a [[Vienna Game]] or, after 3.Nf3 Nc6, to a [[Four Knights Game]]\u2014neither of which offers White an appreciable advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=364\u201365}} {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=121}}. Keilhack also analyzes a number of offbeat possibilities, including 2.b3, 2.Nf3, 2.f4 (an unusual form of [[Bird's Opening]] that Keilhack calls the \"Aasum System\"), 2.g3, and even the gambit 2.g4?! Palliser writes that none of the alternatives to 2.e4 \"really convince or should greatly trouble Black over the board\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=142}}.\n\n===1...e5===\nThis natural move is playable, but dangerous if Black does not know what he is doing. One of the main lines is 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4, with poor chances for Black, continued by 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5. Keilhack writes that this variation \"occurs rather often and offers excellent chances for an early knockout\" by White and that \"only two [moves] (5...Bb4 and 5...Bc5) do not immediately ruin Black's game\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=26}}. (See, e.g., the Dunst\u2013Gresser game given below.)\n\n==Transpositions to other openings==\nThe move 1.Nc3 is considered an [[Irregular openings (chess)|irregular opening]], so it is classified under the A00 code in the [[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]] (also see [[List of chess openings]]).  [[Transposition (chess)|Transpositions]] to more common openings are possible, many of which are discussed in the preceding section.  In addition, 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 reaches a position in the Scandinavian Defense; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.e4 leads to a [[Four Knights Game|Scotch Four Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e4 Bc5 or 3...g6 gives a [[Three Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 Nc6 2.d4 d5 3.e4, or 2...e5 and now 3.d5 Nce7 4.e4 or 3.dxe5 Nxe5 4.e4, yields a [[Nimzowitsch Defense]]; and 1.Nc3 b6 2.e4 Bb7 3.d4 is an [[Owen's Defense]]. Transposition to a [[Dutch Defense]] is also possible after 1.Nc3 f5 2.d4, but Keilhack considers 2.e4! more dangerous, intending 2...fxe4 3.d3, a reversed [[From's Gambit]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=369\u201370}}. Black alternatives to 2...fxe4 include 2...d6, when 3.d4 transposes to the [[Balogh Defense]]; and 2...e5?!, when 3.Nf3 produces a [[Latvian Gambit]], but 3.exf5!, as in a game between [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Sam Loyd]], may be stronger.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1228240 Steinitz\u2013Loyd, London 1867]</ref>\n\n==Sample games==\n*Here is a quick victory by Dunst himself against nine-time U.S. Women's Champion [[Gisela Gresser]]. It illustrates the problems that White's rapid development can pose if Black is not careful:\n:Dunst\u2013Gresser, New York 1950 <br />'''1. Nc3 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Bg5 d5?'''
