The season began on 21 September 1991 and concluded on 17 May 1992. [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|Flamurtari]] began the season as defending champions of the [[1990\u201391 Albanian Superliga|1990\u201391 season]], with [[KF La\u00e7i|La\u00e7i]], [[KS Pogradeci|Pogradeci]] and [[KS Selenic\u00eb|Selenica]] being promoted from the [[Albanian First Division|Albanian Second Division]] as the league was expanded from 14 to 16 teams and the total number of fixtures reduced for the 1991\u201392 season, as clubs faced each twice rather than 3 times.<ref>[http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba92.html Albanian football season 1991\u201392]</ref>\n\n[[Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]] won their 7th Albanian title, having finished 3rd the previous season, with the defending champions finishing 6th following a 6 point deduction.

Of these 16 teams, 13 of them were from the 1990\u201391 season with [[KF La\u00e7i|La\u00e7i]], [[KS Pogradeci|Pogradeci]] and [[KS Selenic\u00eb|Selenica]] being promoted from the [[Albanian First Division|Albanian Second Division]]. 2 sides from the 1991\u201392 season were relegated, and they were [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]]<br />[[KS Selenic\u00eb|Selenica]]. Sk\u00ebnderbeu were the first to be relegated, and Selenica were subsequently relegated on goal difference as they finished level on points with [[KS Kastrioti|Kastrioti]].\n\n===Stadia and last season===\n{{location map+ |Albania |float=right |width=300 |caption=Locations of the 1991\u201392 Albanian National Championship teams |places=\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=40.431419 |long=19.330806 |label=[[Apolonia Fier|Apolonia]] |position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.188539 |long=19.553236 |label=[[Besa Kavaj\u00eb|Besa]] |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.318402 |long=19.823965 |label=[[Dinamo Tirana]] |position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.065715 |long=20.053117 |label=[[KF Elbasani|Elbasani]] |position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=40.455922 |long=19.488986 |label=[[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|Flamurtari]] |position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat= 41.512076 |long= 19.786747 |label=[[Kastrioti Kruj\u00eb|Kastrioti]] |position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.64248 |long=19.711672 |label=[[KF La\u00e7i|La\u00e7i]] |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=40.935552 |long=19.709850 |label=[[KS Lushnja|Lushnja]] |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.318402 |long=19.823965 |label=[[Partizani Tirana|Partizani]] |position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat= 40.900177 |long= 20.664075 |label=[[KS Pogradeci|Pogradeci]] |position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat= 40.530891 |long= 19.632972 |label=[[KS Selenic\u00eb|Selenica]] |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=40.625833 |long=20.782778 |label=[[Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]] |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.326081 |long=19.449856 |label=[[Teuta Durr\u00ebs|Teuta]] |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=41.318402 |long=19.823965 |label=[[KF Tirana|Tirana]] |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=40.699037 |long=19.964469 |label=[[Tomori Berat|Tomori]] |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Albania |lat=42.070031 |long=19.506558 |label=[[Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]] |position=left}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It was named after its main sponsor, [[Tennents]]. The event was held at [[Strathclyde Park]], [[Lanarkshire]] until 1996. It then moved to the disused [[Balado, Kinross|Balado]] airfield, [[Kinross-shire]] from 1997 to 2014. In 2015 the festival moved to Strathallan Castle, [[Strathallan]], [[Perthshire]]. It was originally held over two days, and extended to three days from 2007. Promoted by [[DF Concerts]], the event attracted up to 255,000 people and 70,000 campers.\n\nThe 2017 T in the Park was cancelled due to problems at the 2016 event. It was officially replaced with the [[TRNSMT]] festival which takes place on the same weekend at [[Glasgow Green]].

It was named after its main sponsor, [[Tennents]]. The event was held at [[Strathclyde Park]], [[Lanarkshire]] until 1996. It then moved to the disused [[Balado, Kinross|Balado]] airfield, [[Kinross-shire]] from 1997 to 2014. In 2015 the festival moved to Strathallan Castle, [[Strathallan]], [[Perthshire]]. It was originally held over two days, and extended to three days from 2007. Promoted by [[DF Concerts]], the event attracted up to 255,000 people and 70,000 campers.\n\nThe 2017 T in the Park was cancelled due to problems at the 2016 event. It was officially replaced with the [[TRNSMT]] festival which takes place on the same weekend at [[Glasgow Green]]. The 2017 festival was a success and further editions of TRNSMT followed in 2018 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=T in the Park 'not looking likely' for 2018|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-40593239|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 July 2017|date=13 July 2017}}</ref> In July 2019, the festival organiser, Geoff Ellis, confirmed that T in the Park would not be returning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-48961495 |title=T in the Park won't ever be returning |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe festival was founded in 1994 by Stuart Clumpas and Geoff Ellis,<ref name=bbc-20000712>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/830160.stm |title=Clumpas has success down to a T |publisher=BBC |date=12 July 2000 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref> as part of a joint venture between [[DF Concerts]] and [[Tennent's Lager]] with some help from Irish promotions company [[MCD Productions]].<ref name=freelibrary/> Stuart Clumpas left as an organiser in 2001, selling his commercial interests in the concert.<ref name=heraldscotland-20010908>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12230344.Why_I_apos_m_getting_out_of_here/ |title=Why I'm getting out of here |newspaper=The Hearld |location=Scotland |date=8 September 2001 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=cloonan-frith>{{cite report |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_168676_en.pdf |title=Promoting Business \u2013 DF Concerts |first1=Martin |last1=Cloonan |first2=Simon |last2=Frith |publisher=University of Glasgow |year=2010 |accessdate=2 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003121154/http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_168676_en.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFestival director Geoff Ellis was involved from the start until the end.

He is the son of philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]].  He holds a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and taught for many years prior to that at the [[University of Reading]], [[City University of New York]], and [[Oxford University]].\n\n==Biography==\nStrawson, elder son of Oxford philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]], was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1959\u201365), from where he won a scholarship to [[Winchester College]] (1965\u201368). He left school at 16, after completing his [[A-levels]] and winning a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. At Cambridge, he read Oriental Studies (1969\u201371), Social and Political Science (1971\u201372), and Moral Sciences (1972\u201373), before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an ''auditeur libre'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris and at the [[Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne]] as a French Government Scholar (1977\u201378).\n\nStrawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor of [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. In 1993, he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a Visiting Professor at [[NYU]] (1997), [[Rutgers University]] (2000), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (2010) and the [[Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]], Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, [[Princeton University]] (2011). In 2000, he moved to the [[University of Reading]] as professor of philosophy, and was also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] as holder of a new Chair in Philosophy.<ref>[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html \"Leiter, Brian.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829010954/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html |date=29 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Free will==\nIn the [[free will]] debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether [[determinism]] is true or not.  He argues for this position with what he calls his \"basic argument\", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us.  In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus:\n\n# You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are.\n# To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are\u2014at least in certain crucial mental respects.\n# But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all.\n# So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.<ref>Strawson, Galen. \"[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 Free Will] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=25 August 2007 }}\" in the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], ed.

He is the son of philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]].  He holds a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Texas, Austin]], and taught for many years prior to that at the [[University of Reading]], [[City University of New York]], and [[Oxford University]].\n\n==Biography==\nStrawson, elder son of Oxford philosopher [[P. F. Strawson]], was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1959\u201365), from where he won a scholarship to [[Winchester College]] (1965\u201368). He left school at 16, after completing his [[A-levels]] and winning a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]. At Cambridge, he read Oriental Studies (1969\u201371), Social and Political Science (1971\u201372), and Moral Sciences (1972\u201373), before moving to the University of Oxford, where he received his BPhil in philosophy in 1977 and his DPhil in philosophy in 1983. He also spent a year as an ''auditeur libre'' at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris and at the [[Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne]] as a French Government Scholar (1977\u201378).\n\nStrawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1979 to 2000, first as a Stipendiary Lecturer at several different colleges, and then, from 1987 on, as [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor of [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. In 1993, he was a Visiting Research Fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences, Canberra. He has also taught as a Visiting Professor at [[NYU]] (1997), [[Rutgers University]] (2000), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (2010) and the [[Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales]], Paris (2012). In 2011 he was an Old Dominion Fellow, Council of the Humanities, [[Princeton University]] (2011). In 2000, he moved to the [[University of Reading]] as professor of philosophy, and was also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from 2004 to 2007 at the [[City University of New York]] Graduate Center. In 2012, he joined the faculty at the [[University of Texas, Austin]] as holder of a new Chair in Philosophy.<ref>[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html \"Leiter, Brian.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829010954/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/two-senior-hires-for-ut-austin-strawson-from-reading-montague-from-bristol.html |date=29 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Free will==\nIn the [[free will]] debate, Strawson holds that there is a fundamental sense in which free will is impossible, whether [[determinism]] is true or not.  He argues for this position with what he calls his \"basic argument\", which aims to show that no-one is ever ultimately morally responsible for their actions, and hence that no one has free will in the sense that usually concerns us.  In its simplest form, the basic argument runs thus:\n\n# You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are.\n# To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are\u2014at least in certain crucial mental respects.\n# But you cannot be ultimately responsible for the way you are in any respect at all.\n# So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.<ref>Strawson, Galen. \"[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 Free Will] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=25 August 2007 }}\" in the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], ed.

It airs both on WNOW and in [[Houston]]'s [[KROI]]. \n\nSpecialty programming includes the Friday Vibe and the Saturday Vibe with various house DJs including DJ Orion, DJ Cool Hand Lex, and DJ Indiana Jones.\n\nWNOW-FM is licensed to broadcast in the [[HD Radio]] (hybrid) format.<ref>http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=6420</ref><ref>http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=41 HD Radio Guide for Indianapolis</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Smooth Jazz 100.9===\nPrior to October [[2007 in radio|2007]], the 100.9 FM frequency was home to '''WYJZ''', a [[smooth jazz]] format that began broadcasting on June 15, 1998.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-06-19.pdf</ref>\n\n===RadioNow 100.9===\nOn October 8, 2007, at Noon, the \"RadioNow\" Top 40/CHR format was dropped from the 93.1 FM frequency (then owned by [[Emmis Communications]]) when it switched to Christmas music in advance of picking up the talk format from sister [[WIBC (FM)|WIBC]], which in turn was moving from AM 1070 to clear a spot for [[sports radio]] [[WFNI]] in December 2007.\n\nTwo days later, on October 10, at 4:30 PM, after playing \"Anthem For a New America\" by [[Jeff Lorber]], WYJZ dropped its smooth jazz format and picked up the contemporary hit radio format of WNOU after stunting for a half-hour with a loop of an announcer saying \"RadioNOW, now at 100.9\". Radio One purchased the [[intellectual property]] of WNOU including its \"RadioNOW\" branding, format and logo, which were all installed on 100.9 FM.  Radio One management claimed that they would offer the displaced staffers of the original WNOU the first chance of joining the station's lineup, and would use the same [[voice-over|imaging]] as the former Radio Now. The first song played on \"RadioNOW 100.9\" was \"[[Bartender (T-Pain song)|Bartender]]\" by [[T-Pain]].\n \nOn October 31, 2007, WYJZ picked up the '''WNOU''' call sign, completing the \"move\" of \"Radio Now\" to 100.9.\n\nBy [[2009 in radio|2009]], when [[Cumulus Media]]'s [[WNDX|WRWM]] picked up the [[contemporary hit radio]] format, WNOU started to lean more [[rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] as it forced sister station [[WHHH]] to move from [[rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] to [[urban contemporary|urban]].  The rhythmic lean was reduced when WRWM switched to [[hot adult contemporary]]. WRWM has since reformatted to a Mainstream Rock station and no longer is in direct competition with WNOW.\n\nOn June 30, 2014, WNOU changed its call letters to '''WNOW-FM''', after [[WNYL (FM)|the previous station carrying those call letters]] dropped the call sign and rebranded to AMP Radio.<ref name=\"FCC Call Sign\">{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=6420&Callsign=WNOW-FM |title=WNOW-FM Call Sign History |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}</ref>\n\nWNOW-FM is one of only two stations owned by Urban One that does not carry an urban-oriented format (the other being similarly-formatted [[KROI]] in Houston).\n\n===HD Radio===\nOn December 14, 2015, at 3 p.m., WNOW-FM launched an HD2 sub-channel carrying a [[classic hip hop]] format, branded as \"Boom 102.9.\" The first song on \"Boom\" was \"[[Straight Outta Compton (song)|Straight Outta Compton]]\" by [[N.W.A]].<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/95517/radio-one-launches-boom-102-9-indianapolis/  Radio One Launches Boom 102.9 Indianapolis]</ref> Around July 2018, the 102.9 signal was shut down (likely due to interference with nearby [[WXCH]] in [[Columbus, Indiana]]), with Boom going HD-only at that point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/8vw5ij/boom_1029_off_air/ |title=Boom 102.9 off air?
