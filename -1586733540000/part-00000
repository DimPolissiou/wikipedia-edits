The theatre, which went through major fundraising to finance its renovations and mortgage, at one stage lost its sponsor [[du Maurier (cigarette)|du Maurier]] due to tobacco regulations, but in 2005 received new sponsorship from [[Industrial Alliance|Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company]] and the theatre's name was changed to the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage.\n\n==Movie theatre==\nThe Stanley opened on December 15, 1930.<ref name=cte>{{harvnb|Gilligan}}</ref> Originally envisioned as a [[vaudeville]] venue,<ref name=bump>{{harvnb|Mathison|2006}}</ref> it was built by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in [[Ontario]], who reportedly fell in love with Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there.<ref name=bump/><ref name=southgranville100>{{harvnb|Celebrating Our History: The Stanley Theatre\u2014South Granville's Beating Heart|p=3}}</ref> He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect,<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=cclerk960730>{{harvnb|Policy Report Development and Building: Proposed Rezoning of 2750 Granville Street (Stanley Theatre)}}</ref> who designed it with a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior and an [[Art Deco]] exterior,<ref name=inwood>{{harvnb|Inwood|1998|pp=B1\u2013B2}}</ref> with seating for 1,216 people.<ref name=inwood/> In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials he could find, including tindle stone from [[Winnipeg]] and tiles from [[Italy]], along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> Like the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Stanley Park]], the theatre was named after [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]].<ref name=bump/>\n\nThe first film shown at the Stanley was ''[[One Romantic Night]]'', starring [[Lillian Gish]].<ref name=cte/><ref>{{harvnb|Grand Opening Tonight at 5 p.m. of the Stanley Theatre (advertisement)|p=12}}</ref> Admission was originally between 10 and 40 cents.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The vertical Stanley sign was added in 1940 and the stylized Stanley script came in 1957.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The cinema, which had been part of the Granville Theatre Company,<ref name=cclerk960730/> was bought by [[Famous Players]] in 1941 for $268,000.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/>\n\nThe Stanley was originally built as a neighbourhood theatre, but gradually became more popular and attracted moviegoers from throughout the Vancouver region.<ref name=cclerk960730/> From the 1950s onwards, progressively improved sound and projection systems along with refurbished seating added to the theatre's appeal.<ref name=southgranville100/> On July 8, 1954 the Stanley began showing films in [[stereophonic]] [[CinemaScope]] for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley Theatre Previews CinemaScope Tonite!

The Stanley first opened as a [[movie theater|movie theatre]] in December 1930, and showed movies for over sixty years before falling revenues led to its closure in 1991. After years of threatened commercial redevelopment, the Stanley was renovated as a stage theatre in 1997\u20131998 and subsequently awarded status as a heritage building.\n\nAs a stage for the Arts Club, the Stanley has been used to put on classics, Broadway musicals and other large productions, including ''[[Swing!]]'',  ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Disney's Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[White Christmas (musical)|Irving Berlin's White Christmas]]''. The theatre, which went through major fundraising to finance its renovations and mortgage, at one stage lost its sponsor [[du Maurier (cigarette)|du Maurier]] due to tobacco regulations, but in 2005 received new sponsorship from [[Industrial Alliance|Industrial Alliance Pacific Life Insurance Company]] and the theatre's name was changed to the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage.\n\n==Movie theatre==\nThe Stanley opened on December 15, 1930.<ref name=cte>{{harvnb|Gilligan}}</ref> Originally envisioned as a [[vaudeville]] venue,<ref name=bump>{{harvnb|Mathison|2006}}</ref> it was built by Frederick Guest, owner of a chain of theatres in [[Ontario]], who reportedly fell in love with Vancouver and decided to build his dream theatre there.<ref name=bump/><ref name=southgranville100>{{harvnb|Celebrating Our History: The Stanley Theatre\u2014South Granville's Beating Heart|p=3}}</ref> He hired Henry Holdsby Simmonds as the architect,<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=cclerk960730>{{harvnb|Policy Report Development and Building: Proposed Rezoning of 2750 Granville Street (Stanley Theatre)}}</ref> who designed it with a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] interior and an [[Art Deco]] exterior,<ref name=inwood>{{harvnb|Inwood|1998|pp=B1\u2013B2}}</ref> with seating for 1,216 people.<ref name=inwood/> In order to make as high quality a theatre as possible, Simmonds used only the best materials he could find, including tindle stone from [[Winnipeg]] and tiles from [[Italy]], along with chandeliers, carpets and furnishings from local merchants.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> Like the [[Stanley Cup]] and [[Stanley Park]], the theatre was named after [[Governor General of Canada]] [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]].<ref name=bump/>\n\nThe first film shown at the Stanley was ''[[One Romantic Night]]'', starring [[Lillian Gish]].<ref name=cte/><ref>{{harvnb|Grand Opening Tonight at 5 p.m. of the Stanley Theatre (advertisement)|p=12}}</ref> Admission was originally between 10 and 40 cents.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The vertical Stanley sign was added in 1940 and the stylized Stanley script came in 1957.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/> The cinema, which had been part of the Granville Theatre Company,<ref name=cclerk960730/> was bought by [[Famous Players]] in 1941 for $268,000.<ref name=southgranville100/><ref name=inwood/>\n\nThe Stanley was originally built as a neighbourhood theatre, but gradually became more popular and attracted moviegoers from throughout the Vancouver region.<ref name=cclerk960730/> From the 1950s onwards, progressively improved sound and projection systems along with refurbished seating added to the theatre's appeal.<ref name=southgranville100/> On July 8, 1954 the Stanley began showing films in [[stereophonic]] [[CinemaScope]] for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley Theatre Previews CinemaScope Tonite!

use, which it approved, but the planned development was abandoned, and the building remained vacant for several years.<ref name=cclerk960730/> During the early 1990s, a \"Save Our Stanley\" campaign

were completed, and the actors and musicians were getting ready to first perform in it, there was a general feeling of excitement about the theatre.<ref name=inwood/> Renovations included expansion of the lobby, reconfiguration of the balcony, an expansion of the stage to twice its original size, a new twenty-five metre fly tower from which to raise and lower scenery, new dressing rooms, a trap room, an electrical room and a green room backstage, a reduction of the number of seats from 1,216 to 650, a crush bar in the old projection booth, a section cut out of the theatre's dome to use for spotlights, and a full restoration of the theatre's [[Metal leaf|gold-leafed]] plaster decorations.<ref name=inwood/><ref name=totallighting>{{harvnb|The Stanley Theatre, Vancouver, BC (Total Lighting

and 17th between Fir and Hemlock.<ref name=artscape/> According to the study, this area became more of a leisure/recreation destination, with many new culturally related businesses, retail stores and service-related businesses opening. An increase in overall sales was noted and 76% of surveyed residents responded that the theatre's reopening had a positive effect on the community. Business respondents also reportedly had a positive view of the theatre's effects.<ref name=artscape/>\n\n==Live stage==\n[[File:Stanley Theatre at night.jpg|thumb|right|The 2004\u20132005 production

From the equation, the activation energy can be found through the relation\n:<math>k = A e^{{-E_\\textrm{a}}/{(RT)}}</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is the [[pre-exponential factor]] for the reaction, ''R'' is the universal [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature (usually in [[kelvin]]s), and ''k'' is the [[Reaction rate constant|reaction rate coefficient]]. Even without knowing ''A'', ''E''<sub>a</sub> can be evaluated from the variation in reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature (within the validity of the Arrhenius equation).\n\nAt a more advanced level, the net Arrhenius activation energy term from the Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. There are two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier for an elementary reaction. First, it is often unclear as to whether or not reaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out over all elementary steps have little theoretical value. Second, even if the reaction being studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk ('bulb') experiments involving billions of molecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and angles, different translational and (possibly) vibrational energies\u2014all of which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Catalysts ==\n{{Main|Catalysis}}\n[[Image:Activation energy.svg|thumb|240x240px|The relationship between activation energy (<math>E_\\textrm{a}</math>) and [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy of formation]] (\u0394''H'') with and without a catalyst, plotted against the [[reaction coordinate]].

With the catalyst, the energy required to enter transition state decreases, thereby decreasing the energy required to initiate the reaction.|alt=]]A substance that modifies the transition state to lower the activation energy is termed a [[catalyst]]; a catalyst composed only of protein and (if applicable) small molecule cofactors is termed an [[enzyme]]. A catalyst increases the rate of reaction without being consumed in the reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/reactions/faq/examples-of-catalysts.shtml|title=General Chemistry Online: FAQ: Chemical change: What are some examples of reactions that involve catalysts?|website=antoine.frostburg.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref> In addition, the catalyst lowers the activation energy, but it does not change the energies of the original reactants or products, and so does not change equilibrium.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bui|first1=Matthew|title=The Arrhenius Law: Activation Energies|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Kinetics/Modeling_Reaction_Kinetics/Temperature_Dependence_of_Reaction_Rates/The_Arrhenius_Law/The_Arrhenius_Law%3A_Activation_Energies|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|publisher=UC Davis|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref> Rather, the reactant energy and the product energy remain the same and only the ''activation energy'' is altered (lowered).\n\nA catalyst is able to reduce the activation energy by forming a transition state in a more favorable manner. Catalysts, by nature, create a more \"comfortable\" fit for the substrate of a reaction to progress to a transition state. This is possible due to a release of energy that occurs when the substrate binds to the [[active site]] of a catalyst. This energy is known as Binding Energy. Upon binding to a catalyst, substrates partake in numerous stabilizing forces while within the active site (i.e. [[Hydrogen bond|Hydrogen bonding]], [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals forces]]). Specific and favorable bonding occurs within the active site until the substrate forms to become the high-energy transition state. Forming the transition state is more favorable with the catalyst because the favorable stabilizing interactions within the active site ''release'' energy. A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur. The binding energy released assists in achieving the unstable transition state. Reactions otherwise without catalysts need a higher input of energy to achieve the transition state. Non-catalyzed reactions do not have free energy available from active site stabilizing interactions, such as catalytic enzyme reactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Biochemistry - Ninth Edition|last=Berg|first=Jeremy|publisher=WH Freeman and Company|year=2019|isbn=978-1-319-11467-1|location=New York, NY|pages=240\u2013244}}</ref>\n\n== Relationship with Gibbs energy of activation ==\n{{Main|Transition state theory}}In the [[Arrhenius equation]], the term activation energy (''E''<sub>a</sub>) is used to describe the energy required [[reaction coordinate|to reach the]] [[transition state]], and the exponential relationship ''k'' = ''A'' exp(-''E''<sub>a</sub>/''RT'') holds.  In transition state theory, a more sophisticated model of the relationship between reaction rates and the transition state, a superficially similar mathematical relationship, the [[Eyring equation]], is used to describe the rate of a reaction: ''k'' = (''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'' / ''h'') exp(\u2013\u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup> / ''RT'').  However, instead of modeling the temperature dependence of reaction rate phenomenologically, the Eyring equation models individual elementary step of a reaction.  Thus, for a multistep process, there is no straightforward relationship between the two models.  Nevertheless, the functional forms of the Arrhenius and Eyring equations are similar, and for a one-step process, simple and chemically meaningful correspondences can be drawn between Arrhenius and Eyring parameters.\n\nInstead of also using ''E''<sub>a</sub>, the Eyring equation uses the concept of [[Gibbs energy]] and the symbol \u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup> to denote the Gibbs energy of activation to achieve the [[transition state]]. In the equation, ''k''<sub>B</sub> and ''h'' are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively. Although the equations look similar, it is important to note that the Gibbs energy contains an [[entropy|entropic]] term in addition to the enthalpic one.  In the Arrhenius equation, this entropic term is accounted for by the pre-exponential factor ''A''.  More specifically, we can write the Gibbs free energy of activation in terms of enthalpy and [[entropy of activation]]: \u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup> = \u0394''H''<sup>\u2021</sup> \u2013 ''T'' \u0394''S''<sup>\u2021</sup>.  Then, for a unimolecular, one-step reaction, the ''approximate'' relationships ''E''<sub>a</sub> = \u0394''H''<sup>\u2021</sup> + ''RT'' and ''A'' = (''k''<sub>B</sub>''T''/''h'') exp(1 + \u0394''S''<sup>\u2021</sup>/''R'') hold.  Note, however, that in Arrhenius theory proper, ''A'' is temperature independent, while here, there is a linear dependence on ''T''.  For a one-step unimolecular process whose half-life at room temperature is about 2 hours, \u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup> is approximately 23 kcal/mol.  This is also the roughly the magnitude of ''E''<sub>a</sub> for a reaction that proceeds over several hours at room temperature.  Due to the relatively small magnitude of ''T''\u0394''S''<sup>\u2021</sup> and ''RT'' at ordinary temperatures for most reactions, in sloppy discourse,  ''E''<sub>a</sub>, \u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup>, and \u0394''H''<sup>\u2021</sup> are often conflated and all referred to as the \"activation energy\".\n\nThe total free energy change of a reaction is independent of the activation energy however. Physical and chemical reactions can be either [[Exergonic reaction|exergonic]] or [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]], but the activation energy is not related to the [[Spontaneous process|spontaneity]] of a reaction.

Increasing the temperature leads to a reduced probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another (with more glancing collisions not leading to reaction as the higher momentum carries the colliding particles out of the potential well), expressed as a reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] that decreases with increasing temperature.

From the equation, the activation energy can be found through the relation\n:<math>k = A e^{{-E_\\textrm{a}}/{(RT)}}</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' is the [[pre-exponential factor]] for the reaction, ''R'' is the universal [[gas constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature (usually in [[kelvin]]s), and ''k'' is the [[Reaction rate constant|reaction rate coefficient]]. Even without knowing ''A'', ''E''<sub>a</sub> can be evaluated from the variation in reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature (within the validity of the Arrhenius equation).\n\nAt a more advanced level, the net Arrhenius activation energy term from the Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. There are two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier for an elementary reaction. First, it is often unclear as to whether or not reaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out over all elementary steps have little theoretical value. Second, even if the reaction being studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk ('bulb') experiments involving billions of molecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and angles, different translational and (possibly) vibrational energies\u2014all of which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Catalysts ==\n{{Main|Catalysis}}\n[[Image:Activation energy.svg|thumb|240x240px|The relationship between activation energy (<math>E_\\textrm{a}</math>) and [[Standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy of formation]] (\u0394''H'') with and without a catalyst, plotted against the [[reaction coordinate]].

Catalysts, by nature, create a more \"comfortable\" fit for the substrate of a reaction to progress to a transition state. This is possible due to a release of energy that occurs when the substrate binds to the [[active site]] of a catalyst. This energy is known as Binding Energy. Upon binding to a catalyst, substrates partake in numerous stabilizing forces while within the active site (i.e. [[Hydrogen bond|Hydrogen bonding]], [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals forces]]). Specific and favorable bonding occurs within the active site until the substrate forms to become the high-energy transition state. Forming the transition state is more favorable with the catalyst because the favorable stabilizing interactions within the active site ''release'' energy. A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur. The binding energy released assists in achieving the unstable transition state. Reactions otherwise without catalysts need a higher input of energy to achieve the transition state. Non-catalyzed reactions do not have free energy available from active site stabilizing interactions, such as catalytic enzyme reactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Biochemistry - Ninth Edition|last=Berg|first=Jeremy|publisher=WH Freeman and Company|year=2019|isbn=978-1-319-11467-1|location=New York, NY|pages=240\u2013244}}</ref>\n\n== Relationship with Gibbs energy of activation ==\n{{Main|Transition state theory}}In the [[Arrhenius equation]], the term activation energy (''E''<sub>a</sub>) is used to describe the energy required [[reaction coordinate|to reach the]] [[transition state]], and the exponential relationship ''k'' = ''A'' exp(-''E''<sub>a</sub>/''RT'') holds.  In transition state theory, a more sophisticated model of the relationship between reaction rates and the transition state, a superficially similar mathematical relationship, the [[Eyring equation]], is used to describe the rate of a reaction: ''k'' = (''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'' / ''h'') exp(\u2013\u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup> / ''RT'').  However, instead of modeling the temperature dependence of reaction rate phenomenologically, the Eyring equation models individual elementary step of a reaction.  Thus, for a multistep process, there is no straightforward relationship between the two models.  Nevertheless, the functional forms of the Arrhenius and Eyring equations are similar, and for a one-step process, simple and chemically meaningful correspondences can be drawn between Arrhenius and Eyring parameters.\n\nInstead of also using ''E''<sub>a</sub>, the Eyring equation uses the concept of [[Gibbs energy]] and the symbol \u0394''G''<sup>\u2021</sup> to denote the Gibbs energy of activation to achieve the [[transition state]].
