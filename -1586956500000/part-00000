According to the 2015 [[census]], the city had a population of 20,357 inhabitants.\n\n==Location and history==\nThe township of Ayamonte preserves its old medieval quarter in the central district of the town, with many very narrow streets and historical buildings; this central area is a designated [[list of carfree places|car-free zone]].\n\nFor centuries the ferry link between Ayamonte and [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] was the traditional crossing point between [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. A [[Guadiana International Bridge|modern bridge]] over the [[Guadiana River]] has now been built to the north of the town, linking the motorway systems of the two countries, but the ferry still runs and provides an inexpensive mode of transport between the two countries.\n\nThe beach area of Ayamonte is [[Isla Canela]] and is reached by a causeway across the Marismas del Guadiana; the marismas (salt marshes) are an important wildlife reserve, providing a home to many waterfowl, including herons and flamingos. Isla Canela is built along several kilometers of sandy beaches, and provides an ideal area for windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing. There are a number of quality golf courses in and around the area, including one built into the Marismas itself.\n\nThe city, is also famous for his local festivities, the \"Fiestas de las Ang\u00fastias\" in honor of their patron \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Ang\u00fastias\". The festivities in the beginning of September are a moment of celebration not only from the Ayamontin population, but also for many Andalucians, and Portuguese. The festivities are graced by the local band, \"Banda Ciudad de Ayamonte\" and the Portuguese \"Banda da Sociedade Filarm\u00f3nica Progresso e Labor Samouquense\" from the Portuguese village of [[Samouco]].\n\nThe [[Costa Esuri]] development is just to the north of Ayamonte. It was an ambitious development built by the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]-based developer [[Martinsa-Fadesa]] that stalled as a result of the global [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]. Many properties were left unfinished, but because of the steep reduction in price, the development is starting to have the success that was always expected. The development features two golf courses, though only the west course is open.

According to the 2015 [[census]], the city had a population of 20,357 inhabitants.\n\n==Location and history==\nThe township of Ayamonte preserves its old medieval quarter in the central district of the town, with many very narrow streets and historical buildings; this central area is a designated [[list of carfree places|car-free zone]].\n\nFor centuries the ferry link between Ayamonte and [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] was the traditional crossing point between [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. A [[Guadiana International Bridge|modern bridge]] over the [[Guadiana River]] has now been built to the north of the town, linking the motorway systems of the two countries, but the ferry still runs and provides an inexpensive mode of transport between the two countries.\n\nThe beach area of Ayamonte is [[Isla Canela]] and is reached by a causeway across the Marismas del Guadiana; the marismas (salt marshes) are an important wildlife reserve, providing a home to many waterfowl, including herons and flamingos. Isla Canela is built along several kilometers of sandy beaches, and provides an ideal area for windsurfing, kitesurfing and sailing. There are a number of quality golf courses in and around the area, including one built into the Marismas itself.\n\nThe city, is also famous for his local festivities, the \"Fiestas de las Ang\u00fastias\" in honor of their patron \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Ang\u00fastias\". The festivities in the beginning of September are a moment of celebration not only from the Ayamontin population, but also for many Andalucians, and Portuguese. The festivities are graced by the local band, \"Banda Ciudad de Ayamonte\" and the Portuguese \"Banda da Sociedade Filarm\u00f3nica Progresso e Labor Samouquense\" from the Portuguese village of [[Samouco]].\n\nThe [[Costa Esuri]] development is just to the north of Ayamonte. It was an ambitious development built by the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]-based developer [[Martinsa-Fadesa]] that stalled as a result of the global [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]. Many properties were left unfinished, but because of the steep reduction in price, the development is starting to have the success that was always expected. The development features two golf courses, though only the west course is open. A hotel that was planned remains unfinished.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ayamonte, 1981-2010 normals\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 16.2\n|Feb high C = 17.3\n|Mar high C = 19.6\n|Apr high C = 20.8\n|May high C = 23.2\n|Jun high C = 26.7\n|Jul high C = 29.5\n|Aug high C = 29.3\n|Sep high C = 27.0\n|Oct high C = 23.4\n|Nov high C = 19.5\n|Dec high C = 16.7\n|year high C = \n\n|Jan mean C = 11.6\n|Feb mean C = 12.6\n|Mar mean C = 14.6\n|Apr mean C = 15.9\n|May mean C = 18.3\n|Jun mean C = 21.6\n|Jul mean C = 24.0\n|Aug mean C = 24.0\n|Sep mean C = 22.0\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 15.1\n|Dec mean C = 12.6\n|year mean C = \n\n|Jan low C = 7.0\n|Feb low C = 7.9\n|Mar low C = 9.7\n|Apr low C = 11.0\n|May low C = 13.4\n|Jun low C = 16.6\n|Jul low C = 18.4\n|Aug low C = 18.6\n|Sep low C = 17.1\n|Oct low C = 14.3\n|Nov low C = 10.7\n|Dec low C = 8.6\n|year low C = \n\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 65.3\n|Feb rain mm = 46.9\n|Mar rain mm = 37.2\n|Apr rain mm = 46.9\n|May rain mm = 26.8\n|Jun rain mm = 7.1\n|Jul rain mm = 3.0\n|Aug rain mm = 4.4\n|Sep rain mm = 24.6\n|Oct rain mm = 65.2\n|Nov rain mm = 82.0\n|Dec rain mm = 97.4\n|year rain mm =\n\n|unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan rain days = 9.1\n|Feb rain days = 7.7\n|Mar rain days = 6.0\n|Apr rain days = 7.8\n|May rain days = 5.4\n|Jun rain days = 1.7\n|Jul rain days = 0.3\n|Aug rain days = 0.7\n|Sep rain days = 3.5\n|Oct rain days = 8.6\n|Nov rain days = 7.9\n|Dec rain days = 10.2\n|year rain days =\n\n|source 1 = worldweather.wmo.int<ref>[http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=2177]</ref>\n|date=}}\n\n==Notable births==\n\n===Artists===\n[[Antonio Le\u00f3n Ortega]], (1907\u20131991) - [[sculpture|Sculptor]], he had his professional education in Madrid and he created a personal style in the Andalusian imagery of the 20th century.\n\n===Singers===\nIt is well known as the home of young Spanish idol, [[Mar\u00eda Isabel]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| align = center\n| 1999| 16980\n| 2000| 16939\n| 2001| 17084\n| 2002| 17292\n| 2003| 17402\n| 2004| 17623\n| 2005| 18001\n| source = [http://www.ine.es INE (Spain)]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ayto-ayamonte.es/ Ayuntamiento de Ayamonte]*** changed to www.ayamonte.es **\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026074759/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/institutodeestadistica/sima/htm/sm21010.htm Ayamonte] - Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Multiterritorial de Andaluc\u00eda\n\n{{Municipalities in Huelva}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in the Province of Huelva]]\n", "name_user": "Josu\u00e9 Orf\u00e3o", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClimate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayamonte"}

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] contains '''27 grievances''' against the decisions and actions of British King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].

Secretary Conway informed the Americans that Parliament would not pursue legal action against colonists who had actively protested against the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Acts]], provided that the assemblies would pay for any public property which had been destroyed. In complying with this demand, the Assembly of Massachusetts thought that it would be \"wholesome and necessary for the public good\" to grant free pardon to all who had been engaged in the protests, and passed an act accordingly\u2014but the King refused to ratify it.<ref name=\"Lossing\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/ourcountryhistor08loss |last=Lossing |first=Benson John |authorlink=Benson John Lossing |year=1888 |title=Our Country: A Household History for All Readers, from the Discovery of America to the Present Time, Volume 3 |publisher=Amies Publishing Company|location=Appendix |page=[https:I love Daddy, and each time the King refused to ratify Colonial legislation, he intensified that concern.<ref>[https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3506&context=wlulr Natural Rights And The Founding Fathers - The Virginians], Washington and Lee Law Review</ref><ref>[[Federalist No. 39]], paragraph 2</ref> History professor [[Steven Pincus]] notes that the first grievance is \"extremely important\" because many of the colonies passed measures intended to slow down the pace of slavery.  Any time that such laws were introduced by local assemblies, they \"were routinely vetoed by the Board of Trade, the Secretary of State, and King George III.\"<ref>[https://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/blog/pincus A Conversation with Steven Pincus], Harvard University</ref>\n\n==Grievance 2==\n: \"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\"\n\nThis is an indictment of the King's appointed governors in the colonies who have refused to endorse laws conducive to the public good.  For example, the Assembly of New York took measures in 1764 to conciliate the Six Nations and other Indian tribes. The motives of the Assembly were misconstrued, and the King was told{{by whom|date=April 2019}} that the colonies wished to make all of the Indians to increase their military power and independence from the British crown. The King sent instructions to all his governors to refrain from such alliances and to suspend their operations until he approved them. He then \"utterly neglected to attend to them.\" The Massachusetts Assembly passed a law in 1770 for taxing officers of the British government in that colony, but the King ordered the governor to withhold his assent. This violated the [[Colonial charters in the Thirteen Colonies|colonial charter]], and further showed how little power the colonies had.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n\"Neglect\" is one of two reasons mentioned by  John Locke as a valid reason for dissolved government.<ref name=\"Locke Grievances\" />\n\n==Grievance 3==\n: \"He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\"\n\nChapter 19 of [[Two Treatises of Government]] notes that \"when such a single person, or prince, sets up his own arbitrary will, in place of the laws, which are the will of the society, declared by the legislative, then the legislative is changed.\" Locke lists changing the legislature without the people's knowledge or consent as another situation which justifies reform of government.<ref name=\"LockeGrievances\" />\n\n\n==Grievance 4==\n: \"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\"\n\nOn May 20, 1774, Parliament passed the [[Massachusetts Government Act]] which nullified the Massachusetts Charter of 1691<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murrin |first1=John M. |last2=Johnson |first2=Paul E. |last3=McPherson |first3=James M. |last4=Fahs |first4=Alice |last5=Gerstle |first5=Gary |year=2013 |title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Volume I: To 1877, Concise Edition |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=121 |isbn=9781285657516}}</ref> and allowed governor [[Thomas Gage]] to dissolve the local provincial assembly and force them to meet in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kollen |first=Richard |year=2004 |title=Lexington: From Liberty's Birthplace to Progressive Suburb |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=27 |isbn=9780738524658}}</ref>\n\n==Grievance 5==\n:\u00a8He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\"\n\nThe [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Assembly]] issued a circular to other Assemblies in 1768 urging mutual co-operation in asserting the principle that Great Britain had no right to tax the colonists without their consent. The King then demanded that the Assembly rescind the resolutions expressed in the circular, and he ordered the governor to dissolve the Massachusetts Assembly immediately if they refused. Other assemblies were warned by the British Government not to imitate Massachusetts, and the King dissolved any that refused to yield to their royally appointed governors. The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] and [[Virginia General Assembly]] were dissolved for denying the right of the King to tax the colonies or to extradite Americans to England to stand trial. Several assemblies discussed forming a general Congress with delegates from all the colonies in 1774, and the King dissolved nearly all those that entertained the idea.<ref name=\"Lossing\" /> Royal Governor [[Francis Fauquier]] dissolved the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] on May 31, 1765.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lq1rd1ecFCYC&pg=PA85 Profiles in Colonial History]</ref>{{why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Grievance 6==\n:\"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\"\n\nThe Assembly of New York refused to comply with the provisions of the Mutiny Act in 1766, so Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts#The New York Restraining Act 1767|New York Restraining Act 1767]] which suspended the Assembly's legislative authority.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K-tAs2uTLpYC&pg=PA103 The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People, Volume I]</ref> [[John Dickinson]] discusses the suspension of New York's assembly in ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]''.<ref>Letter I</ref>\n\nThe Assembly of Massachusetts was dissolved in July 1768, and was not permitted to meet again until the last Wednesday of May 1769; even then, they found a military guard surrounding their meeting location with cannons pointed directly at it.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 7==\n: \"He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\"\n\nEngland sent secret agents to America soon after George III took the throne to report on the condition of the colonists. There was a large influx of German immigrants, and the King wanted to discourage such immigrations. Obstacles in the way of procuring lands, and otherwise, were put in the way of all emigrants, except England, and the tendency of French Roman Catholics to settle in Maryland was also discouraged. The British government was concerned over the increasing power of the colonies and the widespread popularity of republican ideals among German immigrants. After the peace of 1763, few people settled west of the Alleghenies due to these restrictions, and immigration had almost ceased by the time of the revolution.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 8==\n: \"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\"\n\nParliament deprived the people of Massachusetts the right to elect their judges in 1774. Instead, the King appointed all the colony's judges, and they were dependent on him for their salaries and subject to his directions\u2014and those salaries came from taxes and duties on the colonists. The same act deprived the colonists of the benefit of trial by jury, and the \"administration of justice\" was obstructed. Other colonies expressed similar grievances concerning the courts of law.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 9==\n: \"He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\"\n\nJudges and royally appointed governors did not depend upon the colonists for their income; they drew their salaries from the King, and the American colonists saw that this led their officers to sympathize with Parliament but not with the colonies. The Colonial assemblies protested against these measures, leading to the formation of the [[Committees of correspondence]] in 1774.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/historynewengla09palfgoog/page/n490 <!-- pg=458 --> History of New England: History of New England from the revolution of the seventeenth century to the revolution of the eighteenth], pp 457-458</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=telMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA84 A Distinct Judicial Power: The Origins of an Independent Judiciary, 1606-1787], p. 84</ref>\n\nWhen [[Peter Oliver (loyalist)|Chief Justice Oliver]] declared it to be his intention to receive his salary from the crown,<ref>[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-03-02-0016-0018 Independence of the Judges, 1773\u20131774]</ref> the Assembly proceeded to impeach him and petitioned [[Governor Thomas Hutchinson]] for his removal.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=V34QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA95]</ref> The governor refused compliance and great irritation ensued.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bR9fRMjtC-8C&pg=PA46 Tea Party to Independence: The Third Phase of the American Revolution, 1773-1776]</ref>\n\n==Grievance 10==\n: \"He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\"\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Stamp Act]], stamp distributors were appointed in every considerable town. In 1766 and 1767, acts for the collection of duties created \"swarms of officers\", all of whom received high salaries; and when in 1768, admiralty and vice-admiralty courts were established on a new basis, an increase in the number of officers was made. The high salaries and extensive prerequisites of all of these were paid with the people's money, and thus \"swarms of officers\" \"eat out their substance.\"<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 11==\n: \"He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\"\n\nIn 1763, Britain and France signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] to end the French and Indian War.  Shortly thereafter, an Indian uprising known as [[Pontiac's War]] broke out.  The uprising was highly effective, resulting in the total destruction of a number of British forts in the Ohio River Territory.  As a result of this defeat, the British realized they needed to keep a permanent army in the American colonies in order both to keep the French from reasserting their control of their former territories and to prevent open warfare between the colonists and the Indians along the frontier.  Although the colonists initially welcomed the protection provided by the British Army,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Franklin |first1=Benjamin |title=Narrative of the Late Massacres |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-11-02-0012 |website=Founders Online |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> by the 1760s and early 1770s they had increasingly come to see the army as a tool for Parliament to enforce various revenue acts -- e.g. the [[Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] -- that the colonists viewed as illegitimate. The last straw came in 1774 when Parliament passed the [[Quartering Act]] in response to the [[Boston Tea Party]].  This act allowed British officers to appropriate private property to quarter their troops without the consent of the property's owners.  When General [[Thomas Gage]] occupied Boston in September 1774, he relied on this act to quarter his troops.  It was Gage's military occupation of Boston that led the [[Second Continental Congress]] to include this grievance in the [[Declaration of Independence]].\n\n==Grievance 12==\n: \"He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\"\n\nGeneral Gage, commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, was appointed the governor of Massachusetts in 1774; and to put the measures of the Boston Port Bill into execution, he encamped several regiments of soldiers upon Boston Common. The military there, and also in New York, was made independent of, and superior to, the civil power, and this, too, in a time of peace, before the Minutemen were organized.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 13==\n: \"He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\"\n\nThe \"''others''\" with whom the King is thus said to have combined were the members of the British Parliament, the existence of which as a legally constituted body possessing authority over them the Americans thus refused even by implication to recognize.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Fortnightly Review |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQgeAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA153 |volume=34 |pages=153}}</ref>  This was due to the establishment of a Board of Trade, to act independent of colonial legislation through its creatures (resident commissioners of customs) in the enforcement of revenue laws.  This was altogether foreign to the constitution of any of the colonies and produced great indignation. The establishment of this power and the remodeling of the admiralty courts to exclude trial by jury therein, in most cases rendered the government fully obnoxious to the charge in the text. The people felt their degradation under such petty tyranny and resolved to spurn it. It was effectually done in Boston, and the government, after all its bluster, was obliged to recede. In 1774, the members of the council of Massachusetts (answering to our Senate), were, by a Parliamentary enactment, chosen by the king, to hold the office during his pleasure. Almost unlimited power was also given to the governor, and the people were indeed subjected to \"a jurisdiction foreign to their constitution\" by these members of royalty.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 14==\n: \"For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\"\n\nIn 1765, the British Parliament passed an amendment to the Mutiny Act commonly referred to as the Quartering Act. It allowed British troops stationed in the colonies to demand food and shelter from any citizen, and forced them to comply or face punishment.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 15==\n: \"For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\"\n\nIn 1768, two citizens of Annapolis, in Maryland, were murdered by some marines belonging to a British armed ship. The trial was a mockery of justice; and in the face of clear evidence against them, the criminals were acquitted. In the difficulties with the Regulators in North Carolina, in 1771, some of the soldiers who had shot down citizens when standing up in defense of their rights, were tried for murder and acquitted; while Governor Tryon hung six prisoners of war, who were entitled to the benefits of the laws of war, as his soldiers were.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 16==\n: \"For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\"\n\nIn 1764, the British naval commanders banned trade with the Spanish and French West Indies, even though it was in violation of the old [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]] of 1660, which had been almost ineffectual. Finally, Lord North concluded to punish the refractory colonists of New England, by crippling their commerce with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies. Fishing on the banks of Newfoundland was also prohibited, and thus, their \"trade with all parts of the world\" was cut off.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 17==\n:\"For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\"\n\nIn addition to the revenue taxes imposed from and were attempted to be collected utilizing writs of assistance, the Stamp Act was passed, and duties upon paper, painters' colors, glass, tea, and many other goods, were levied. This worsened tension between the colonists and the imperial government, as most colonists believed that representation was needed for fair taxes, and the British were continually trying to pay off debt from the Seven Years' War <ref>\"Seven Years' War\"</ref> <ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 18==\n: \"For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of [[Trial by Jury]]:\"\n\nAfter these functionaries were driven from Boston in 1768, an act was passed which placed violations of the revenue laws under the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, where the offenders were tried court biased towards the crown.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 19==\n: \"For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses:\"\n\nOn the fifteenth of April, 1774, Lord North introduced a bill in Parliament, entitled \"A bill for the impartial administration of justice in the cases of persons questioned for any acts done by them in the execution of the laws, or for the suppression of riots and tumults in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England.\" This bill, known as the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]], provided that in case any person indicted for murder in that province, or any other capital offence, or an indictment for riot, resistance of the magistrate, or impeding the revenue laws in the smallest degree, he might, at the option of the Governor, or, in his absence, of the Lieutenant Governor, be taken to another colony, or transported to Great Britain, for trial.\n\nThe bill met violent opposition in parliament. The minister seemed to be actuated more by a spirit of retaliation, than by a conviction of the necessity of such a measure. \"We must show the Americans,\" said he, \"that we will no longer sit quietly under their insults; and also, that even when roused, our measures are not cruel or vindictive, but necessary and efficacious.\" Colonel Barre denounced the bill in unmeasured terms, as big with misery and pregnant with danger to the British Empire. \"This,\" said he, \"is indeed the most extraordinary resolution that was ever heard in the Parliament of England. It offers new encouragement to military insolence, already so insupportable.

With the passage of the [[Quebec Act]], parliament invested a legislative council in Canada with all powers except levying of taxes.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XpKLDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA17 The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels ]</ref>  This was a major event leading up to the total military control of Canada, Giving up their political rights for doubtful religious privileges, made them willing slaves, and Canada remained a part of the British empire when its sister colonies rejoiced in freedom.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 21==\n: \"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\"\n\nThis is a reiteration of a charge already considered, and refers to the alteration of the Massachusetts charter, to make judges and other officers independent of the people, and subservient to the crown. The governor was empowered to remove and appoint all inferior judges, the attorney-generals, provost-marshals, and justices of the peace, and to appoint sheriffs independent of the council. As the sheriffs chose jurors, trial by jury became mostly nonexistent. The people had hitherto been allowed, by their charter, to select jurors; now the entire matter was placed in the hands of the government.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 22==\n: \"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\"\n\nThis, too, is another phase of the charge just considered.

Lord Dunmore assumed this right in 1775, and so did Sir James Wright of Georgia, and Lord William Campbell of South Carolina. .<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 23==\n: \"He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\"\n\nIn his message to Parliament early in 1775, the king declared the colonists to be in a state of open rebellion; and by sending armies hither to make war upon them, he \"abdicated government,\" by thus declaring them \"out of his protection.\"  Shortly after, the [[Prohibitory Act]] was passed by Parliament. He sanctioned the acts of governors in employing the Native Americans against his subjects, and himself bargained for the employment of [[Hessian (soldier)|German hirelings]]. <ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\nJohn Adams said of the Prohibitory act: \"It throws thirteen colonies out of the royal protection, levels all distinctions, and makes us independent in spite of our supplications and entreaties ...

Dunmore was charged with a design to employ the Native Americans against the Virginians as early as 1774; and while ravaging the Virginia coast in 1775 and 1776, he endeavored to excite the slaves against their masters. He was also concerned with Governor Gage and others, under instructions from the British ministry, in exciting the ''Shawnetse'', and other native inhabitants of the Ohio country, against the white people. Emissaries were also sent among the ''Cherokees'' and ''Creeks'' for the same purpose; and all of the tribes of the ''Six Nations'', except the ''Oneidas'', were found in arms with the British when the war began.

Secretary Conway informed the Americans that Parliament would not pursue legal action against colonists who had actively protested against the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Acts]], provided that the assemblies would pay for any public property which had been destroyed. In complying with this demand, the Assembly of Massachusetts thought that it would be \"wholesome and necessary for the public good\" to grant free pardon to all who had been engaged in the protests, and passed an act accordingly\u2014but the King refused to ratify it.<ref name=\"Lossing\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/ourcountryhistor08loss |last=Lossing |first=Benson John |authorlink=Benson John Lossing |year=1888 |title=Our Country: A Household History for All Readers, from the Discovery of America to the Present Time, Volume 3 |publisher=Amies Publishing Company|location=Appendix |page=[https://archive.org/details/ourcountryhistor08loss/page/n133 1]-10}}</ref> Self government was at the heart of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]' concerns, and each time the King refused to ratify Colonial legislation, he intensified that concern.<ref>[https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3506&context=wlulr Natural Rights And The Founding Fathers - The Virginians], Washington and Lee Law Review</ref><ref>[[Federalist No. 39]], paragraph 2</ref> History professor [[Steven Pincus]] notes that the first grievance is \"extremely important\" because many of the colonies passed measures intended to slow down the pace of slavery.

For example, the Assembly of New York took measures in 1764 to conciliate the Six Nations and other Indian tribes. The motives of the Assembly were misconstrued, and the King was told{{by whom|date=April 2019}} that the colonies wished to make all of the Indians to increase their military power and independence from the British crown. The King sent instructions to all his governors to refrain from such alliances and to suspend their operations until he approved them. He then \"utterly neglected to attend to them.\" The Massachusetts Assembly passed a law in 1770 for taxing officers of the British government in that colony, but the King ordered the governor to withhold his assent. This violated the [[Colonial charters in the Thirteen Colonies|colonial charter]], and further showed how little power the colonies had.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n\"Neglect\" is one of two reasons mentioned by  John Locke as a valid reason for dissolved government.<ref name=\"Locke Grievances\" />\n\n==Grievance 3==\n: \"He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\"\n\nChapter 19 of [[Two Treatises of Government]] notes that \"when such a single person, or prince, sets up his own arbitrary will, in place of the laws, which are the will of the society, declared by the legislative, then the legislative is changed.\" Locke lists changing the legislature without the people's knowledge or consent as another situation which justifies reform of government.<ref name=\"LockeGrievances\" />\n\n\n==Grievance 4==\n: \"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\"\n\nOn May 20, 1774, Parliament passed the [[Massachusetts Government Act]] which nullified the Massachusetts Charter of 1691<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murrin |first1=John M. |last2=Johnson |first2=Paul E. |last3=McPherson |first3=James M. |last4=Fahs |first4=Alice |last5=Gerstle |first5=Gary |year=2013 |title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Volume I: To 1877, Concise Edition |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=121 |isbn=9781285657516}}</ref> and allowed governor [[Thomas Gage]] to dissolve the local provincial assembly and force them to meet in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kollen |first=Richard |year=2004 |title=Lexington: From Liberty's Birthplace to Progressive Suburb |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=27 |isbn=9780738524658}}</ref>\n\n==Grievance 5==\n:\u00a8He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\"\n\nThe [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Assembly]] issued a circular to other Assemblies in 1768 urging mutual co-operation in asserting the principle that Great Britain had no right to tax the colonists without their consent. The King then demanded that the Assembly rescind the resolutions expressed in the circular, and he ordered the governor to dissolve the Massachusetts Assembly immediately if they refused. Other assemblies were warned by the British Government not to imitate Massachusetts, and the King dissolved any that refused to yield to their royally appointed governors. The [[North Carolina General Assembly]] and [[Virginia General Assembly]] were dissolved for denying the right of the King to tax the colonies or to extradite Americans to England to stand trial. Several assemblies discussed forming a general Congress with delegates from all the colonies in 1774, and the King dissolved nearly all those that entertained the idea.<ref name=\"Lossing\" /> Royal Governor [[Francis Fauquier]] dissolved the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] on May 31, 1765.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lq1rd1ecFCYC&pg=PA85 Profiles in Colonial History]</ref>{{why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Grievance 6==\n:\"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\"\n\nThe Assembly of New York refused to comply with the provisions of the Mutiny Act in 1766, so Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts#The New York Restraining Act 1767|New York Restraining Act 1767]] which suspended the Assembly's legislative authority.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K-tAs2uTLpYC&pg=PA103 The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People, Volume I]</ref> [[John Dickinson]] discusses the suspension of New York's assembly in ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]''.<ref>Letter I</ref>\n\nThe Assembly of Massachusetts was dissolved in July 1768, and was not permitted to meet again until the last Wednesday of May 1769; even then, they found a military guard surrounding their meeting location with cannons pointed directly at it.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 7==\n: \"He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\"\n\nEngland sent secret agents to America soon after George III took the throne to report on the condition of the colonists. There was a large influx of German immigrants, and the King wanted to discourage such immigrations. Obstacles in the way of procuring lands, and otherwise, were put in the way of all emigrants, except England, and the tendency of French Roman Catholics to settle in Maryland was also discouraged. The British government was concerned over the increasing power of the colonies and the widespread popularity of republican ideals among German immigrants. After the peace of 1763, few people settled west of the Alleghenies due to these restrictions, and immigration had almost ceased by the time of the revolution.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 8==\n: \"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\"\n\nParliament deprived the people of Massachusetts the right to elect their judges in 1774.

In 1766 and 1767, acts for the collection of duties created \"swarms of officers\", all of whom received high salaries; and when in 1768, admiralty and vice-admiralty courts were established on a new basis, an increase in the number of officers was made. The high salaries and extensive prerequisites of all of these were paid with the people's money, and thus \"swarms of officers\" \"eat out their substance.\"<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 11==\n: \"He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\"\n\nIn 1763, Britain and France signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] to end the French and Indian War.  Shortly thereafter, an Indian uprising known as [[Pontiac's War]] broke out.  The uprising was highly effective, resulting in the total destruction of a number of British forts in the Ohio River Territory.  As a result of this defeat, the British realized they needed to keep a permanent army in the American colonies in order both to keep the French from reasserting their control of their former territories and to prevent open warfare between the colonists and the Indians along the frontier.  Although the colonists initially welcomed the protection provided by the British Army,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Franklin |first1=Benjamin |title=Narrative of the Late Massacres |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-11-02-0012 |website=Founders Online |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> by the 1760s and early 1770s they had increasingly come to see the army as a tool for Parliament to enforce various revenue acts -- e.g. the [[Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] -- that the colonists viewed as illegitimate. The last straw came in 1774 when Parliament passed the [[Quartering Act]] in response to the [[Boston Tea Party]].  This act allowed British officers to appropriate private property to quarter their troops without the consent of the property's owners.  When General [[Thomas Gage]] occupied Boston in September 1774, he relied on this act to quarter his troops.  It was Gage's military occupation of Boston that led the [[Second Continental Congress]] to include this grievance in the [[Declaration of Independence]].\n\n==Grievance 12==\n: \"He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.\"\n\nGeneral Gage, commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, was appointed the governor of Massachusetts in 1774; and to put the measures of the Boston Port Bill into execution, he encamped several regiments of soldiers upon Boston Common. The military there, and also in New York, was made independent of, and superior to, the civil power, and this, too, in a time of peace, before the Minutemen were organized.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 13==\n: \"He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\"\n\nThe \"''others''\" with whom the King is thus said to have combined were the members of the British Parliament, the existence of which as a legally constituted body possessing authority over them the Americans thus refused even by implication to recognize.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Fortnightly Review |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQgeAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA153 |volume=34 |pages=153}}</ref>  This was due to the establishment of a Board of Trade, to act independent of colonial legislation through its creatures (resident commissioners of customs) in the enforcement of revenue laws.  This was altogether foreign to the constitution of any of the colonies and produced great indignation. The establishment of this power and the remodeling of the admiralty courts to exclude trial by jury therein, in most cases rendered the government fully obnoxious to the charge in the text. The people felt their degradation under such petty tyranny and resolved to spurn it. It was effectually done in Boston, and the government, after all its bluster, was obliged to recede. In 1774, the members of the council of Massachusetts (answering to our Senate), were, by a Parliamentary enactment, chosen by the king, to hold the office during his pleasure. Almost unlimited power was also given to the governor, and the people were indeed subjected to \"a jurisdiction foreign to their constitution\" by these members of royalty.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 14==\n: \"For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\"\n\nIn 1765, the British Parliament passed an amendment to the Mutiny Act commonly referred to as the Quartering Act. It allowed British troops stationed in the colonies to demand food and shelter from any citizen, and forced them to comply or face punishment.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 15==\n: \"For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\"\n\nIn 1768, two citizens of Annapolis, in Maryland, were murdered by some marines belonging to a British armed ship. The trial was a mockery of justice; and in the face of clear evidence against them, the criminals were acquitted. In the difficulties with the Regulators in North Carolina, in 1771, some of the soldiers who had shot down citizens when standing up in defense of their rights, were tried for murder and acquitted; while Governor Tryon hung six prisoners of war, who were entitled to the benefits of the laws of war, as his soldiers were.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 16==\n: \"For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\"\n\nIn 1764, the British naval commanders banned trade with the Spanish and French West Indies, even though it was in violation of the old [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]] of 1660, which had been almost ineffectual. Finally, Lord North concluded to punish the refractory colonists of New England, by crippling their commerce with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies. Fishing on the banks of Newfoundland was also prohibited, and thus, their \"trade with all parts of the world\" was cut off.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 17==\n:\"For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\"\n\nIn addition to the revenue taxes imposed from and were attempted to be collected utilizing writs of assistance, the Stamp Act was passed, and duties upon paper, painters' colors, glass, tea, and many other goods, were levied. This worsened tension between the colonists and the imperial government, as most colonists believed that representation was needed for fair taxes, and the British were continually trying to pay off debt from the Seven Years' War <ref>\"Seven Years' War\"</ref> <ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 18==\n: \"For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of [[Trial by Jury]]:\"\n\nAfter these functionaries were driven from Boston in 1768, an act was passed which placed violations of the revenue laws under the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, where the offenders were tried court biased towards the crown.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 19==\n: \"For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses:\"\n\nOn the fifteenth of April, 1774, Lord North introduced a bill in Parliament, entitled \"A bill for the impartial administration of justice in the cases of persons questioned for any acts done by them in the execution of the laws, or for the suppression of riots and tumults in the province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England.\" This bill, known as the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]], provided that in case any person indicted for murder in that province, or any other capital offence, or an indictment for riot, resistance of the magistrate, or impeding the revenue laws in the smallest degree, he might, at the option of the Governor, or, in his absence, of the Lieutenant Governor, be taken to another colony, or transported to Great Britain, for trial.\n\nThe bill met violent opposition in parliament. The minister seemed to be actuated more by a spirit of retaliation, than by a conviction of the necessity of such a measure. \"We must show the Americans,\" said he, \"that we will no longer sit quietly under their insults; and also, that even when roused, our measures are not cruel or vindictive, but necessary and efficacious.\" Colonel Barre denounced the bill in unmeasured terms, as big with misery and pregnant with danger to the British Empire. \"This,\" said he, \"is indeed the most extraordinary resolution that was ever heard in the Parliament of England. It offers new encouragement to military insolence, already so insupportable. By this law, the Americans are deprived of a right which belongs to every human creature, that of demanding justice before a tribunal composed of impartial judges.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson John |authorlink=Benson John Lossing |year=1870 |title=Lives of the signers of the Declaration of American independence |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofsignersof00loss |publisher=Evans, Stoddart & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/livesofsignersof00loss/page/292 292]}}</ref>\n\nThe text of the bill contained the following:\n<blockquote>In that case, it shall and may be lawful for the governor, or lieutenant-governor, to direct, with the advice and consent of the council, that the inquisition, indictment, or appeal, shall be tried in some other of his Majesty's colonies, or Great Britain.<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36619/36619-h/36619-h.htm The Colonization of North America], \"Lord North's Coercive Policy\"; by [[Herbert Eugene Bolton]]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Grievance 20==\n: \"For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\"\n\nThe British ministry thought it prudent to take early steps to secure a footing in America so near the scene of inevitable rebellion as to allow them to breast, successfully, the gathering storm. With the passage of the [[Quebec Act]], parliament invested a legislative council in Canada with all powers except levying of taxes.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XpKLDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA17 The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels ]</ref>  This was a major event leading up to the total military control of Canada, Giving up their political rights for doubtful religious privileges, made them willing slaves, and Canada remained a part of the British empire when its sister colonies rejoiced in freedom.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 21==\n: \"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\"\n\nThis is a reiteration of a charge already considered, and refers to the alteration of the Massachusetts charter, to make judges and other officers independent of the people, and subservient to the crown. The governor was empowered to remove and appoint all inferior judges, the attorney-generals, provost-marshals, and justices of the peace, and to appoint sheriffs independent of the council. As the sheriffs chose jurors, trial by jury became mostly nonexistent. The people had hitherto been allowed, by their charter, to select jurors; now the entire matter was placed in the hands of the government.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 22==\n: \"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\"\n\nThis, too, is another phase of the charge just considered. Suppression occurred of the Legislature of New York, and in several cases, the governors, after dissolving Colonial Assemblies, assumed the right to make proclamations stand in the place of statute law. Lord Dunmore assumed this right in 1775, and so did Sir James Wright of Georgia, and Lord William Campbell of South Carolina. .<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==Grievance 23==\n: \"He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\"\n\nIn his message to Parliament early in 1775, the king declared the colonists to be in a state of open rebellion; and by sending armies hither to make war upon them, he \"abdicated government,\" by thus declaring them \"out of his protection.\"  Shortly after, the [[Prohibitory Act]] was passed by Parliament. He sanctioned the acts of governors in employing the Native Americans against his subjects, and himself bargained for the employment of [[Hessian (soldier)|German hirelings]]. <ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\nJohn Adams said of the Prohibitory act: \"It throws thirteen colonies out of the royal protection, levels all distinctions, and makes us independent in spite of our supplications and entreaties ...

They also \"ravaged our coasts and burnt our towns.\" Charlestown, Falmouth (now Portland, in Maine), and Norfolk were burnt, and Dunmore and others \"ravaged our coasts,\" and \"destroyed the lives of our people.\" And at the very time when this Declaration was being read to the assembled Congress, the shattered fleet of [[Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker]] was sailing northward, after an attack upon Charleston, South Carolina.<ref name=\"Lossing\" /><ref>[https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/commodore-parker-prepares-for-a-naval-strike-on-charleston Commodore Parker prepares for a naval strike on Charleston]</ref>\n\n==Grievance 25==\n: \"He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\"\n\nThe hire of [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian Soldiers]] as mercenaries for use against the [[Thirteen Colonies]], see the May 15th preamble.<ref>{{cite letter |title=Letters of Delegates to Congress: Volume: 3 January 1, 1746 - May 15, 1776 |last=Adams |first=John |authorlink=John Adams |recipient=[[James Warren (politician)|James Warren]] |date=1776}}</ref>\n\n==Grievance 26==\n: \"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\"\n\nAn act of Parliament passed toward the close of December 1775, authorized the capture of all American vessels, and also directed the treatment of the crews of armed vessels to be slaves and not as prisoners of war. They were to be enrolled for \"the service of his majesty\" in [[Impressment]] and were thus compelled to fight for the crown,<ref>[https://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/2124 British Naval Impressment and Atlantic Origins of the American Revolution]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xr3TGtIeNTQC&pg=PA170 Enter the Press-gang: Naval Impressment in Eighteenth-century British Literature]</ref> even against their own peers.

Dunmore was charged with a design to employ the Native Americans against the Virginians as early as 1774; and while ravaging the Virginia coast in 1775 and 1776, he endeavored to excite the slaves against their masters. He was also concerned with Governor Gage and others, under instructions from the British ministry, in exciting the ''Shawnetse'', and other native inhabitants of the Ohio country, against the white people. Emissaries were also sent among the ''Cherokees'' and ''Creeks'' for the same purpose; and all of the tribes of the ''Six Nations'', except the ''Oneidas'', were found in arms with the British when the war began. Thus excited, dreadful massacres occurred on the borders of the several colonies.<ref name=\"Lossing\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]], a document written by the [[Stamp Act Congress]] and passed on October 14, 1765. \n* [[Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress]], a statement adopted by the [[First Continental Congress]] on October 14, 1774, in response to the [[Intolerable Acts]] passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.org/details/cihm_20519 An answer to the Declaration of the American Congress], by [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]\n\n{{Historical American Documents}}\n\n[[Category:American Revolution|Declaration of Independence]]\n[[Category: George III of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category: United States Declaration of Independence| ]]\n", "name_user": "2601:582:8102:4a00:3585:f7ca:dbe9:51cb", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eGrievance 1)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievances_of_the_United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"}

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===16===\n\n===15===\n* [[Kasongo wa Kanema]], Congolese musician [https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-47639452 (BBC)]\n\n===14===\n*[[Pip Baker]], 91, British screenwriter (''[[Doctor Who]]''), complications from a fall.<ref>[http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2020/04/pip-baker-died-2020.html Pip Baker 1928 - 2020]</ref>\n*{{ill|Haydar Ba\u015f|tr}}, 73, Turkish politician, founder and leader of the [[Independent Turkey Party]] (since 2002), COVID-19.<ref>[https://ria.ru/20200414/1570015283.html \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442 COVID-19] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Aldo de Cillo Pagotto|pt}}, 70, Brazilian Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sobral|Sobral]] (1998\u20132004) and Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Para\u00edba|Para\u00edba]] (2004\u20132016).<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bcilp.html Archbishop Aldo de Cillo Pagotto]</ref>\n*[[Miguel \u00c1ngel D'Annibale]], 61, Argentine Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of R\u00edo Gallegos|R\u00edo Gallegos]] (2013\u20132018) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Mart\u00edn|San Mart\u00edn]] (since 2018), leukaemia.<ref>[http://www.aica.org/43924-fallecio-mons-miguel-angel-dannibale-obispo-de-san-martin.html Falleci\u00f3 Mons.

He was the eldest son of [[Shivaji]], the founder of the Maratha Empire and his first wife [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]]. He was successor of the realm after his father's death, and ruled it for nine years. Sambhaji's rule was largely shaped by the ongoing wars between the Maratha kingdom and [[Mughal Empire]] as well as other neighbouring powers such as the [[Siddi]]s, [[Mysore]] and the Portuguese in [[Goa]]. In 1689, Sambhaji was captured, tortured and executed by the Mughals, and succeeded by his brother [[Rajaram I]].<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSambhaji was born at [[Purandar fort]] to [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]], Shivaji's first wife.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur. Both sides were vying for the crucial support of [[Hambirrao Mohite]] the commander-in-chief of Maratha army. He was the brother of [[Soyarabai]] and the maternal uncle of [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> . Soyarabai issued orders to [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] and [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle|Moropant]] to leave Raigad with a force of 5,000 to arrest Sambhaji at Panhala. Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala. Sambhaji was delighted at the arrival of Hambirrao on his side<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=196-208}}</ref> . Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Historians have been quick to note the distinction between the more tolerant and chivalrous practices of his father Shivaji, and the more pragmatic and brutal practices of Sambhaji. \n\n===Attack on Burhanpur===\nThe fort of Burhanpur was first in the charge of Bahadur khan who later gave it to Kakar Khan. Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens. In order to accomplish the task, Kakar Khan destroyed more than 100 temples surrounding Burhanpur and conducting torture, plunder, killing, cutting of women's ears and men's eyes for the wealth. The Jizya was collected and stored captive at the Burhanpur fort.<ref>{|url=  http://informatonaboutsambhajiraje.blogspot.com/2016/10/maratha-yodhha-early-life-sambhaji-was.html?m=1}</ref>.Sambhaji plundered and ravaged [[Burhanpur]] in 1680.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

Sambhaji's rule was largely shaped by the ongoing wars between the Maratha kingdom and [[Mughal Empire]] as well as other neighbouring powers such as the [[Siddi]]s, [[Mysore]] and the Portuguese in [[Goa]].

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur. Both sides were vying for the crucial support of [[Hambirrao Mohite]] the commander-in-chief of Maratha army. He was the brother of [[Soyarabai]] and the maternal uncle of [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> . Soyarabai issued orders to [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] and [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle|Moropant]] to leave Raigad with a force of 5,000 to arrest Sambhaji at Panhala. Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala. Sambhaji was delighted at the arrival of Hambirrao on his side<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=196-208}}</ref> . Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Soyarabai was guilty for her actions and commited suicide by poisoning herself. Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens. In order to accomplish the task, Kakar Khan destroyed more than 100 temples surrounding Burhanpur and conducting torture, plunder, killing, cutting of women's ears and men's eyes for the wealth.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.
