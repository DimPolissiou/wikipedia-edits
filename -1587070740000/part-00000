It has been called the \"Battle Hymn of the [[Reformation]]\" for the effect it had in increasing the support for the Reformers' cause. [[John D. Julian|John Julian]] records four theories of its origin:<ref name=Julian />\n\n* [[Heinrich Heine]]: \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" was sung by Luther and his companions as they entered [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on 16 April 1521 for the [[Diet of Worms|Diet]];\n* K. F. T. Schneider: it was a tribute to Luther's friend Leonhard Kaiser, who was executed on 16 August 1527;\n* [[Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign\u00e9]]: it was sung by the German Lutheran princes as they entered Augsburg for the Diet in 1530, at which the [[Augsburg Confession]] was presented; and\n* the view that it was composed in connection with the [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|1529 Diet of Speyer]], at which the German Lutheran princes lodged their protest to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], who wanted to enforce his 1521 [[Edict of Worms]].\n\nAlternatively, [[John M. Merriman]] writes that the hymn \"began as a martial song to inspire soldiers against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces\" during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon |last= Merriman |first= John |authorlink= John M.

Payton Jr., ''Getting the Reformation Wrong. Correcting Some Misunderstandings'', page 82.</ref> Furthermore, the last line of the fourth stanza of the German text reads: \"Das Reich muss uns doch bleiben\", which is generally translated into English as \"The Kingdom must remain ours\" whilst it may also be interpreted as meaning: the [[Holy Roman Empire]] must remain with the Germans.\n\nTradition states that the sixth Lutheran [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]], [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], had it played as his forces went to battle in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The hymn had been translated into Swedish already in 1536, presumably by [[Olaus Petri]], with the [[incipit]], \"V\u00e5r Gud \u00e4r oss en v\u00e4ldig borg\".<ref>''Psalmer och s\u00e5nger'' (\u00d6rebro: Libris; Stockholm: Verbum, 1987), Item 237, which uses [[Johan Olof Wallin]]'s 1816 revision of the translation attributed to Petri. The first line is \"V\u00e5r Gud \u00e4r oss en v\u00e4ldig borg.\"</ref> In the late 19th century the song also became an anthem of the early [[Swedish Social Democratic Party#Political impact and history|Swedish socialist movement]].\n\nIn addition to being consistently popular throughout [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]]  in Protestant hymnbooks, it is now a suggested hymn for [[Catholic Mass]]es in the U.S.,<ref>[http://www.canticanova.com/planning/year-c/pln4c_m.htm Cantica Nova]</ref> and appears in the ''Catholic Book of Worship'' published by the Canadian Catholic Conference in 1972.<ref>https://hymnary.org/hymnal/CBoW1972</ref>\n\n=== English translations ===\nThe first English translation was by [[Myles Coverdale]] in 1539 with the title, \"Oure God is a defence and towre\". The first English translation in \"common usage\" was \"God is our Refuge in Distress, Our strong Defence\" in J.C. Jacobi's ''Psal. Ger.'', 1722, p.&nbsp;83.<ref name=Julian/>\n\nAn English version less literal in translation but more popular among Protestant denominations outside Lutheranism is \"A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing\", translated by Frederick H. Hedge in 1853; this version is the one included in the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. Another popular English translation is by [[Thomas Carlyle]] and begins \"A safe stronghold our God is still\".\n\nMost North American [[Lutheran]] churches have not historically used either the Hedge or Carlyle translations. Traditionally, the most commonly used translation in Lutheran congregations is a composite translation from the 1868 ''Pennsylvania Lutheran Church Book'' (\"A mighty fortress is our God, a trusty shield and weapon\"). In more recent years a new translation completed for the 1978 ''[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (\"A mighty fortress is our God, a sword and shield victorious\") has also gained significant popularity.\n\n=== Compositions based on the hymn ===\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename=A mighty fortress (Bass vocals).ogg\n| title=\"A Mighty Fortress\" sung in English\n| description=\"A Mighty Fortress is Our God\" \u2013 F.

Bach set the tune twice in his ''Choralges\u00e4nge'' (''Choral Hymns''), BWV 302 and BWV 303 (for four voices). He used strains of the tune in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''. There is a version for organ, Chorale Prelude BWV 720, written by Bach for the organ at [[Divi Blasii]], [[M\u00fchlhausen]]. Two orchestrations of Bach's settings were made by conductors [[Leopold Stokowski]] and [[Walter Damrosch]]. [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] also wrote an organ chorale setting (BuxWV 184), as did [[Johann Pachelbel]]. [[George Frideric Handel]] used the melody in his ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'', which is probably a wrong attribution.<ref>Not in Handel's ''Solomon'' (1749): [[John Eliot Gardiner|J. E. Gardiner]], in his liner notes to his 1984 recording of the oratorio, stated the usage of the melody in No. 56, the double chorus \"Praise the Lord\". It is however another melody by Martin Luther: a passage from the Sanctus of the German Mass (Deutsche Messe) \"Holy is God, the Lord Zebaoth\" (\"Heilig ist Gott, der Herr Zebaoth\").

[[Joachim Raff]] wrote an Overture (for orchestra), ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'', Op. 127. [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] [[Musical quotation|quoted]] it in his five-act grand opera ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836), and [[Richard Wagner]] used it as a \"motive\" in his \"Kaisermarsch\" (\"Emperor's March\"), which was composed to commemorate the return of [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm I]] from the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871.<ref name=Julian /><ref name=Stulken /> Two organ settings were written by [[Max Reger]]: his chorale fantasia [[Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott (Reger)|''Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott'', Op. 27]], and a much shorter chorale prelude as No. 6 of his [[52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67]], in 1902.

It has been called the \"Battle Hymn of the [[Reformation]]\" for the effect it had in increasing the support for the Reformers' cause. [[John D. Julian|John Julian]] records four theories of its origin:<ref name=Julian />\n\n* [[Heinrich Heine]]: \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" was sung by Luther and his companions as they entered [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on 16 April 1521 for the [[Diet of Worms|Diet]];\n* K. F. T. Schneider: it was a tribute to Luther's friend Leonhard Kaiser, who was executed on 16 August 1527;\n* [[Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign\u00e9]]: it was sung by the German Lutheran princes as they entered Augsburg for the Diet in 1530, at which the [[Augsburg Confession]] was presented; and\n* the view that it was composed in connection with the [[Diet of Speyer (1529)|1529 Diet of Speyer]], at which the German Lutheran princes lodged their protest to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], who wanted to enforce his 1521 [[Edict of Worms]].\n\nAlternatively, [[John M. Merriman]] writes that the hymn \"began as a martial song to inspire soldiers against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces\" during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon |last= Merriman |first= John |authorlink= John M.

Payton Jr., ''Getting the Reformation Wrong. Correcting Some Misunderstandings'', page 82.</ref> Furthermore, the last line of the fourth stanza of the German text reads: \"Das Reich muss uns doch bleiben\", which is generally translated into English as \"The Kingdom must remain ours\" whilst it may also be interpreted as meaning: the [[Holy Roman Empire]] must remain with the Germans.\n\nTradition states that the sixth Lutheran [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]], [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], had it played as his forces went to battle in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The hymn had been translated into Swedish already in 1536, presumably by [[Olaus Petri]], with the [[incipit]], \"V\u00e5r Gud \u00e4r oss en v\u00e4ldig borg\".<ref>''Psalmer och s\u00e5nger'' (\u00d6rebro: Libris; Stockholm: Verbum, 1987), Item 237, which uses [[Johan Olof Wallin]]'s 1816 revision of the translation attributed to Petri. The first line is \"V\u00e5r Gud \u00e4r oss en v\u00e4ldig borg.\"</ref> In the late 19th century the song also became an anthem of the early [[Swedish Social Democratic Party#Political impact and history|Swedish socialist movement]].\n\nIn addition to being consistently popular throughout [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]]  in Protestant hymnbooks, it is now a suggested hymn for [[Catholic Mass]]es in the U.S.,<ref>[http://www.canticanova.com/planning/year-c/pln4c_m.htm Cantica Nova]</ref> and appears in the ''Catholic Book of Worship'' published by the Canadian Catholic Conference in 1972.<ref>https://hymnary.org/hymnal/CBoW1972</ref>\n\n=== English translations ===\nThe first English translation was by [[Myles Coverdale]] in 1539 with the title, \"Oure God is a defence and towre\". The first English translation in \"common usage\" was \"God is our Refuge in Distress, Our strong Defence\" in J.C. Jacobi's ''Psal. Ger.'', 1722, p.&nbsp;83.<ref name=Julian/>\n\nAn English version less literal in translation but more popular among Protestant denominations outside Lutheranism is \"A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing\", translated by Frederick H. Hedge in 1853; this version is the one included in the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. Another popular English translation is by [[Thomas Carlyle]] and begins \"A safe stronghold our God is still\".\n\nMost North American [[Lutheran]] churches have not historically used either the Hedge or Carlyle translations. Traditionally, the most commonly used translation in Lutheran congregations is a composite translation from the 1868 ''Pennsylvania Lutheran Church Book'' (\"A mighty fortress is our God, a trusty shield and weapon\"). In more recent years a new translation completed for the 1978 ''[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (\"A mighty fortress is our God, a sword and shield victorious\") has also gained significant popularity.\n\n=== Compositions based on the hymn ===\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename=A mighty fortress (Bass vocals).ogg\n| title=\"A Mighty Fortress\" sung in English\n| description=\"A Mighty Fortress is Our God\" \u2013 F.

Bach set the tune twice in his ''Choralges\u00e4nge'' (''Choral Hymns''), BWV 302 and BWV 303 (for four voices). He used strains of the tune in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''. There is a version for organ, Chorale Prelude BWV 720, written by Bach for the organ at [[Divi Blasii]], [[M\u00fchlhausen]]. Two orchestrations of Bach's settings were made by conductors [[Leopold Stokowski]] and [[Walter Damrosch]]. [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] also wrote an organ chorale setting (BuxWV 184), as did [[Johann Pachelbel]]. [[George Frideric Handel]] used the melody in his ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'', which is probably a wrong attribution.<ref>Not in Handel's ''Solomon'' (1749): [[John Eliot Gardiner|J. E. Gardiner]], in his liner notes to his 1984 recording of the oratorio, stated the usage of the melody in No. 56, the double chorus \"Praise the Lord\". It is however another melody by Martin Luther: a passage from the Sanctus of the German Mass (Deutsche Messe) \"Holy is God, the Lord Zebaoth\" (\"Heilig ist Gott, der Herr Zebaoth\").

[[Joachim Raff]] wrote an Overture (for orchestra), ''Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott'', Op. 127. [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] [[Musical quotation|quoted]] it in his five-act grand opera ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836), and [[Richard Wagner]] used it as a \"motive\" in his \"Kaisermarsch\" (\"Emperor's March\"), which was composed to commemorate the return of [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm I]] from the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871.<ref name=Julian /><ref name=Stulken /> Two organ settings were written by [[Max Reger]]: his chorale fantasia [[Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott (Reger)|''Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott'', Op. 27]], and a much shorter chorale prelude as No. 6 of his [[52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67]], in 1902.

Pakistan's eventual total of 9 for 176 constituted a good recovery. It was the first time, in the tournament, that India had failed to bowl out the opposition. India bagged 49 out of a maximum possible 50 wickets in the tournament.\n\nIndian openers [[Ravi Shastri]] and [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]] each had wonderful tournaments and their century opening stand did most of the work for their strong batting line-up. Each were rewarded at the end of the match with Srikkanth winning the Player of the Match award and Shastri being named the player of the tournament, or as it was known, the Champion of Champions. He was awarded his prize of an [[Audi 100]] motor car, valued at A$35,000 and immediately drove it around the MCG with his entire team sitting either in or on the car.

It was that position in which he won his first All-Australian selection in 1987.\n\nA defender, Langford won four premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991. He captained the club in the 1994 season and earned a second [[All-Australian]] selection.\n\nHe holds a place on the interchange bench in Hawthorn's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nLate in his career, Langford did \"a Minton\", moving to [[Sydney]] to work as an accountant, but commuting to Melbourne to training and play with his club. In 2012, he moved back to Melbourne.\n\n===Merger game===\nLangford's antics at the end of the [[Melbourne Hawks|merger game]] against Melbourne in 1996 inspired many Hawthorn members to vote against the merger proposal. Langford (Hawthorn's full back) took off his Hawthorn jumper and proudly held it above his head while leaving the field. Langford was only one of the then playing list to display his disapproval of the plan.\n\n==Statistics==\n:<ref>[https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Stephen_Silvagni.html Stephen Silvagni's player profile at AFL Tables]</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start with votes}}\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1983 VFL season|1983]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 11 || 3 || 9 || 105 || 66 || 171 || 39 || {{n/a}} || 0.3 || 0.8 || 9.5 || 6.0 || 15.5 || 3.5 || {{n/a}} || 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1984 VFL season|1984]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 22 || 17 || 19 || 185 || 62 || 247 || 54 || {{n/a}} || 0.8 || 0.9 || 8.4 || 2.8 || 11.2 || 2.5 || {{n/a}} || 1\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1985 VFL season|1985]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 22 || 2 || 7 || 190 || 74 || 264 || 62 || {{n/a}} || 0.1 || 0.3 || 8.6 || 3.4 || 12.0 || 2.8 || {{n/a}} || 0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1986 VFL season|1986]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 28 || 23 || 0 || 0 || 216 || 96 || 312 || 64 || {{n/a}} || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.4 || 4.2 || 13.6 || 2.8 || {{n/a}} || 5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1987 VFL season|1987]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 26 || 1 || 2 || 265 || 114 || 379 || 98 || 26 || 0.0 || 0.1 || 10.2 || 4.4 || 14.6 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1988 VFL season|1988]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 2 || 1 || 223 || 77 || 300 || 75 || 16 || 0.1 || 0.0 || 10.1 || 3.5 || 13.6 || 3.4 || 0.7 || 5\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1989 VFL season|1989]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 0 || 1 || 216 || 96 || 312 || 82 || 19 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.4 || 4.2 || 13.6 || 3.6 || 0.8 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1990 AFL season|1990]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 20 || 2 || 0 || 164 || 68 || 232 || 62 || 13 || 0.1 || 0.0 || 8.2 || 3.4 || 11.6 || 3.1 || 0.7 || 3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;background:#afe6ba;\"|[[1991 AFL season|1991]]\u2020\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 25 || 0 || 0 || 231 || 86 || 317 || 72 || 29 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.2 || 3.4 || 12.7 || 2.9 || 1.2 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1992 AFL season|1992]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 4 || 0 || 185 || 79 || 264 || 49 || 20 || 0.2 || 0.0 || 8.0 || 3.4 || 11.5 || 2.1 || 0.9 || 0\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1993 AFL season|1993]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 0 || 0 || 192 || 85 || 277 || 50 || 38 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 9.1 || 4.0 || 13.2 || 2.4 || 1.8 || 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1994 AFL season|1994]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 0 || 3 || 132 || 87 || 219 || 64 || 22 || 0.0 || 0.2 || 7.3 || 4.8 || 12.2 || 3.6 || 1.2 || 11\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1995 AFL season|1995]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 0 || 1 || 160 || 79 || 239 || 54 || 21 || 0.0 || 0.1 || 8.9 || 4.4 || 13.3 || 3.0 || 1.2 || 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1996 AFL season|1996]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 1 || 0 || 248 || 58 || 306 || 97 || 30 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 11.8 || 2.8 || 14.6 || 4.6 || 1.4 || 3\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1997 AFL season|1997]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 8 || 1 || 2 || 77 || 21 || 98 || 32 || 6 || 0.1 || 0.3 || 9.6 || 2.6 || 12.3 || 4.0 || 0.8 || 0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 303\n! 33\n! 45\n! 2789\n! 1148\n! 3937\n! 954\n! 240\n! 0.1\n! 0.1\n! 9.2\n! 3.8\n! 13.0\n! 3.1\n! 1.1\n! 38\n|}\n\n==Career==\nAfter his career, he moved into game administration and was appointed to the [[AFL Commission]] in 1999.\n\n==Family==\n\nChris' son [[Will Langford|Will]] was recruited to Hawthorn in the 2011 Rookie draft, and was upgraded to the Hawthorn senior list in June 2013.

She accepts a job as a nanny and moves into a multimillion-dollar penthouse on the [[Upper West Side]] with the wealthy Ross family which includes [[Jet set|jet-setting]] parents Morgan and Christina Ross and their four rambunctious children: Emma, Luke, Ravi, and Zuri, along with the family pet, Mr. Kipling, a seven-foot [[Asian water monitor]] lizard, that was later revealed to be a female. With a whole new world of experiences open to her, Jessie embarks on new adventures in the big city as she grows to rely on the love and support of the children in her care.

As a recent high school graduate rebelling against her strict father who wanted her to join the army, Jessie moved to [[New York City]] to realize her dreams of stardom but, due to an unexpected turn of events, ends up becoming a nanny to the four Ross children. Even though at times both Jessie and the Ross kids annoy each other, they all deeply care for one another and Jessie is even shown to be sometimes overprotective. Later her last name is revealed to be Prescott. In the episode \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep29|Make New Friends, but Hide the Old]]\", she reveals that she is an only child.

He also spends time with his lizard Mr. Kipling\u2014later revealed to be Mrs. Kipling\u2014which he brought from India.\n*{{visible anchor|Zuri Ross}} ([[Skai Jackson]]) is a sassy, strong-willed, quick-witted and talkative girl who was brought to NYC from her birth country of Uganda.

In \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep20|Tempest in a Teacup]]\", it is revealed that Bertram is claustrophobic. He also has a passion for opera music and boy bands.

Her first spat with Jessie and the Ross clan involved Mrs. Kipling tearing her clothes up in the elevator. She dislikes anyone who is not rich, who is under 20, or who is less self-absorbed than herself. This sadly doesn't stop her from repeatedly hitting on Bertram, lavishing too much affection on her chihuahua, Zeus, or constantly calling Jessie by the wrong name. In \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep30|101 Lizards]]\", it is revealed that she has a daughter, Cassandra, and owns a lizard sanctuary. It is also revealed in \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep73|Between the Swoon and New York City]]\" that she has a son named Brooks. It is also revealed that she has been married more than once.

Their friendship is threatened when Rosie stands up for Bryn in \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep41|Kids Don't Wanna Be Shunned]]\".\n*Agatha ([[Jennifer Veal]]) is an unattractive, arrogant British nanny who frequently locks horns with Jessie and the Ross children. During their first meeting, she attempts to ban Zuri and Jessie from Central Park. Zuri and Jessie ignore Agatha and keep coming back, so Agatha starts posting mean things, saying that Jessie is a bad nanny on her website \"Toddler Tattler\". Zuri, Jessie, and Christina stand up to Agatha and Agatha shuts down her website. Agatha has a twin sister, Angela, revealed in \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep19|Evil Times Two]]\", who is even more dishonest and tries to steal Jessie's job, but Jessie and the Ross kids stand up to her and she goes back to England.

Officer Petey met Agatha at a fair in the park, and thought she was cute until he learned her mole and snaggle-tooth were not part of her costume.\n*Connie Thompson ([[Sierra McCormick]]) is an insane girl with an obsessive crush on Luke.

She accepts a job as a nanny and moves into a multimillion-dollar penthouse on the [[Upper West Side]] with the wealthy Ross family which includes [[Jet set|jet-setting]] parents Morgan and Christina Ross and their four rambunctious children: Emma, Luke, Ravi, and Zuri, along with the family pet, Mr. Kipling, a seven-foot [[Asian water monitor]] lizard, that was later revealed to be a female. With a whole new world of experiences open to her, Jessie embarks on new adventures in the big city as she grows to rely on the love and support of the children in her care. Assisting her are Bertram ([[Kevin Chamberlin]]), the family's lazy and sarcastic butler, and Tony ([[Chris Galya]]), the building's 20-year-old doorman.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n[[File:Cast_of_Disneys_Jessie.jpg|thumb|Main characters of ''Jessie'' L-R: Bertram, Zuri, Luke, Jessie, Emma and Ravi (with his pet lizard Mr. Kipling)]] \n*{{visible anchor|Jessie Prescott}} ([[Debby Ryan]]) is an idealistic and resourceful girl from the military base of [[Fort Hood]], Texas. As a recent high school graduate rebelling against her strict father who wanted her to join the army, Jessie moved to [[New York City]] to realize her dreams of stardom, but due to an unexpected turn of events, ends up becoming a nanny to the four Ross children.

Later her last name is revealed to be Prescott. In the episode \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep29|Make New Friends, but Hide the Old]]\", she reveals that she is an only child.

In \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep20|Tempest in a Teacup]]\", it is revealed that Bertram is claustrophobic. He also has a passion for opera music and boy bands.

Her first spat with Jessie and the Ross clan involved Mrs. Kipling tearing her clothes up in the elevator. She dislikes anyone who is not rich, who is under 20, or who is less self-absorbed than herself. This sadly doesn't stop her from repeatedly hitting on Bertram, lavishing too much affection on her chihuahua, Zeus, or constantly calling Jessie by the wrong name. In \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep30|101 Lizards]]\", it is revealed that she has a daughter, Cassandra, and owns a lizard sanctuary.

During their first meeting, she attempts to ban Zuri and Jessie from Central Park. Zuri and Jessie ignore Agatha and keep coming back, so Agatha starts posting mean things, saying that Jessie is a bad nanny on her website \"Toddler Tattler\". Zuri, Jessie, and Christina stand up to Agatha and Agatha shuts down her website. Agatha has a twin sister, Angela, revealed in \"[[List of Jessie episodes#ep19|Evil Times Two]]\", who is even more dishonest and tries to steal Jessie's job, but Jessie and the Ross kids stand up to her and she goes back to England. This was the only time Agatha, who despises the long-favored Angela, was on the same side as Jessie. Officer Petey met Agatha at a fair in the park, and thought she was cute until he learned her mole and snaggle-tooth were not part of her costume.\n*Connie Thompson ([[Sierra McCormick]]) is an insane girl with an obsessive crush on Luke.

I was absolutely captivated. Then Disney looked at the script and the show runner (O'Connell) and myself and they were like: 'Awesome. We like it. You're on in the fall'\".<ref name=\"Star-Telegram\" /> In interviews with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Disney Channel President [[Gary Marsh]] spoke of working with Ryan again: \"It's been thrilling to watch Debby grow from an unknown actress to one of our top stars.

It used mainly [[propaganda]] to accomplish its goals.\n\n==Organizational history==\n[[File:U.S. Official War Pictures, by Louis Fancher.jpg|thumb|right|\"U.S. Official War Pictures\", CPI poster by [[Louis D.

[https://www.questia.com/library/1664084/holding-fast-the-inner-lines-democracy-nationalism online]</ref>  Creel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort. It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.   Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men.  CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.<ref>Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America\u2019s Persuaders'' (1999)</ref> Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.   Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.<ref>Lisa Mastrangelo,  \"World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation.\" ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.</ref>  Historians were assigned to write pamphlets and in-depth histories of the causes of the European war.<ref>George T.

In his memoirs, Creel claimed that the CPI routinely denied false or undocumented atrocity reports, fighting the crude propaganda efforts of \"patriotic organizations\" like the [[National Security League]] and the [[American Defense Society]] that preferred \"general thundering\" and wanted the CPI to \"preach a gospel of hate.\"<ref>Creel, 195-6</ref>\n\nThe committee used newsprint, posters, radio, telegraph, and movies to broadcast its message. It recruited about 75,000 \"[[Four Minute Men]],\" volunteers who spoke about the war at social events for an ideal length of four minutes. They covered the draft, rationing, war bond drives, victory gardens and why America was fighting. They were advised to keep their message positive, always use their own words and avoid \"hymns of hate.\"<ref>Thomas Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I.'' New York: Basic Books, 2003; pg. 117.</ref> For ten days in May 1917, the Four Minute Men were expected to promote \"Universal Service by Selective Draft\" in advance of national draft registration on June 5, 1917.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pp. 92-94.</ref>\n\nThe CPI staged events designed for many different ethnic groups, in their language. For instance, Irish-American tenor [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]] sang at Mount Vernon before an audience representing Irish-American organizations.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pp. 117-118.</ref> The Committee also targeted the American worker and, endorsed by [[Samuel Gompers]], filled factories and offices with posters designed to promote the critical role of American labor in the success of the war effort.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 118.</ref>\n\nThe CPI's activities were so thorough that historians later stated, using the example of a typical midwestern American farm family, that<ref name=\"sweeney2001\">{{cite book | title=Secrets of Victory: The Office of Censorship and the American Press and Radio in World War II | publisher=University of North Carolina Press | pages=[https://archive.org/details/secretsofvictory00swee/page/15 15\u201316] | author=Sweeney, Michael S. | year=2001 | location=Chapel Hill | isbn=978-0-8078-2598-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/secretsofvictory00swee/page/15 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Every item of war news they saw\u2014in the country weekly, in magazines, or in the city daily picked up occasionally in the general store\u2014was not merely officially approved information but precisely the same kind that millions of their fellow citizens were getting at the same moment. Every war story had been censored somewhere along the line\u2014 at the source, in transit, or in the newspaper offices in accordance with \u2018voluntary\u2019 rules established by the CPI.}}\n\nCreel wrote about the Committee's rejection of the word propaganda, saying: \"We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational and informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was needed than the simple, straightforward presentation of facts.\"<ref name = \"War2\" />\n\nA report published in 1940 by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] credits the Committee with creating \"the most efficient engine of war propaganda which the world had ever seen\", producing a \"revolutionary change\" in public attitude toward US participation in WWI:<ref>pp. 75-76, Harold J. Tobin and Percy W. Bidwell, ''Mobilizing Civilian America'', New York: Council on Foreign Relations.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In November 1916, the slogan of Wilson's supporters, 'He Kept Us Out Of War,' played an important part in winning the election. At that time a large part of the country was apathetic.... Yet, within a very short period after America had joined the belligerents, the nation appeared to be enthusiastically and overwhelmingly convinced of the justice of the cause of the Allies, and unanimously determined to help them win. The revolutionary change is only partly explainable by a sudden explosion of latent anti-German sentiment detonated by the declaration of war. Far more significance is to be attributed to the work of the group of zealous amateur propagandists, organized under Mr. George Creel in the Committee on Public Information. With his associates he planned and carried out what was perhaps the most effective job of large-scale war propaganda which the world had ever witnessed.}}\n\n===Organizational structure===\nDuring its lifetime, the organization had over twenty bureaus and divisions, with commissioner's offices in nine foreign countries.<ref name = \"Image2\">{{cite book| last =Jackall| first =Robert|author2=Janice M Hirota| year =2003| title =Image Makers: Advertising, Public Relations, and the Ethos of Advocacy| publisher =University of Chicago Press| location =| isbn =978-0-226-38917-2| page = 14}}</ref>\n\nBoth a News Division and a Films Division were established to help get out the war message. The CPI's daily newspaper, called the ''Official Bulletin'', began at eight pages and grew to 32. It was distributed to every newspaper, post office, government office, and military base.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pp. 118-119.</ref> Stories were designed to report positive news. For example, the CPI promoted an image of well-equipped US troops preparing to face the Germans that were belied by the conditions visiting Congressmen reported.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 173.</ref> The CPI released three feature-length films: ''Pershing's Crusaders'' (May 1918), ''America's Answer (to the Hun)'' (August 1918), ''Under Four Flags'' (November 1918). They were unsophisticated attempts to impress the viewer with snippets of footage from the front, far less sensational than the \"crudely fantastical\" output of Hollywood in the same period.<ref>Thomas Doherty, ''Projections of War: Hollywood, American Culture, and World War II'' (NY: Columbia University Press, 1999), 89-91. Hollywood's films \"served to discredit not only the portrayal of war on screen but the whole enterprise of cinematic propaganda.\" Hollywood titles included ''Escaping the Hun'', ''To Hell with the Kaiser!'', and ''The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin''.</ref>\n\nTo reach those Americans who might not read newspapers, attend meetings or watch movies, Creel created the Division of Pictorial Publicity.<ref name=\"gov\">{{Cite web|title=The Most Famous Poster|author=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm015.html|accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref> \nThe Division produced 1438 designs for propaganda posters, cards buttons and cartoons in addition to 20000 ''lantern pictures'' (slides) to be used with the speeches.<ref>Creel, George. ''How we advertised America''. New York & London: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1920. p. 7.</ref>\n[[Charles Dana Gibson]] was America's most popular illustrator {{spaced ndash}} and an ardent supporter of the war. When Creel asked him to assemble a group of artists to help design posters for the government, Gibson was more than eager to help. Famous illustrators such as [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Joseph Pennell]], [[Louis D. Fancher]], and [[N. C. Wyeth]] were brought together to produce some of World War I's most lasting images.\n\n===Media incidents===\nOne early incident demonstrated the dangers of embroidering the truth. The CPI fed newspapers the story that ships escorting the First Division to Europe sank several German submarines, a story discredited when newsmen interviewed the ships' officers in England. Republican Senator [[Boies Penrose]] of Pennsylvania called for an investigation and ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the CPI \"the Committee on Public Misinformation.\"<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pp. 119-120.</ref> The incident turned the once compliant news publishing industry into skeptics.<ref>Mary S. Mander, ''Pen and Sword: American War Correspondents, 1898-1975'' (University of Illinois, 2010), 46. Creel believed his story was correct, but that opponents in the military who were jealous of his control of military information minimized what happened en route.</ref> There is some confusion as to whether or not the claims are correct based upon subsequent information publsihed by the CPI.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Creel|first=George|url=https://archive.org/details/howweadvertiseda01cree|title=How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information that Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe|date=1920|publisher=Harper & Brothers|language=en}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1918, the CPI made a premature announcement that \"the first American built battle planes are today en route to the front in France,\" but newspapers learned that the accompanying pictures were fake, there was only one plane, and it was still being tested.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 173. Creel blamed the Secretary of War for the false story.</ref> At other times, though the CPI could control in large measure what newspapers printed, its exaggerations were challenged and mocked in Congressional hearings.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 240.</ref> The Committee's overall tone also changed with time, shifting from its original belief in the power of facts to mobilization based on hate, like the slogan \"Stop the Hun!\" on posters showing a US soldier taking hold of a German soldier in the act of terrorizing a mother and child, all in support of war bond sales.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 247.</ref>\n\n===International efforts===\nThe CPI extended its efforts overseas as well and found it had to tailor its work to its audience. In Latin America, its efforts were led where possible by American journalists with experience in the region, because, said one organizer, \"it is essentially a newspaperman's job\" with the principal aim of keeping the public \"informed about war aims and activities.\" The Committee found the public bored with the battle pictures and stories of heroism supplied for years by the competing European powers. In Peru it found there was an audience for photos of shipyards and steel mills. In Chile it fielded requests for information about America's approach to public health, forest protection, and urban policing. In some countries it provided reading rooms and language education. Twenty Mexican journalists were taken on a tour of the United States.<ref>James R. Mock, \"The Creel Committee in Latin America,\" in ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' vol. 22 (1942), 262-79, esp. 266-7, 269-70, 272-4</ref>\n\n===Political conflict===\nCreel used his overseas operations as a way to gain favor with congressmen who controlled the CPI's funding, sending friends of congressmen on brief assignments to Europe.<ref>Stone, Melville Elijah. ''Fifty Years a Journalist''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Page and Company, 1921. p. 342-5.</ref> Some of his business arrangements drew congressional criticism as well, particularly his sale by competitive bidding of the sole right to distribute battlefield pictures.<ref>''Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, on the Proposed Revenue Act of 1918, Part II: Miscellaneous Taxes'' (Washington, DC: 1918), 967ff., [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UpOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA967& available online], accessed January 19, 2011.</ref> Despite hearings to air grievances against the CPI, the investigating committee passed its appropriation unanimously.<ref>Stephens, Oren. ''Facts to a Candid World: America's Overseas Information Program''. Stanford University Press, 1955. p. 33.</ref>\n\nCreel also used the CPI's ties to the newspaper publishing industry to trace the source of negative stories about Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], a former newsman and a political ally. He tracked them to [[Louis Howe]], assistant to Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and threatened to expose him to the President.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory''. p. 148-149.</ref> As a Wilson partisan, Creel showed little respect for his congressional critics, and Wilson enjoyed how Creel expressed sentiments the President could not express himself.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory''. p. 315.</ref><ref>For Wilson's support of Creel to a group of senators, see Thomas C. Sorenson, \"We Become Propagandists,\" in Garth S. Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell (eds.), ''Readings in Propaganda and Persuasion: New and Classic Essays'' (Sage Publications, 2006), p. 88. Asked if he thought all Congressmen were loyal, Creel answered: \"I do not like slumming, so I won't explore into the hearts of Congress for you.\" Wilson later said: \"Gentlemen, when I think of the manner in which Mr. Creel has been maligned and persecuted, I think it is a very human thing for him to have said.\"</ref>\n\n===Termination and disestablishment===\nCommittee work was curtailed after July 1, 1918. Domestic activities stopped after the [[Armistice]] was signed on November 11, 1918. Foreign operations ended June 30, 1919. Wilson abolished the CPI by executive order 3154 on August 21, 1919.\n\nThe Committee on Public Information was formally disestablished by an act of Congress on June 30, 1919, although the organization's work had been formally completed months before.<ref name=CreelIX>Creel, ''How We Advertised America,'' pg. ix.</ref> On August 21, 1919, the disbanded organization's records were turned over to the [[Council of National Defense]].<ref name=CreelIX />\n\n==Memoirs==\nCreel later published his memoirs of his service with the CPI, ''How We Advertised America'', in which he wrote:<ref name = \"War2\">George Creel, ''How We Advertised America.''

Its emphasis throughout was on the open and the positive. At no point did it seek or exercise authorities under those war laws that limited the freedom of speech and press. In all things, from first to last, without halt or change, it was a plain publicity proposition, a vast enterprise in salesmanship, the world's greatest adventures in advertising.... We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption.

He had once written an editorial criticizing Creel for violating civil liberties, as Police Commissioner of Denver. Without naming Creel, he wrote in a memo to Wilson that censorship should \"never be entrusted to anyone who is not himself tolerant, nor to anyone who is unacquainted with the long record of folly which is the history of suppression.\" After the war, Lippmann criticized the CPI's work in Europe: \"The general tone of it was one of unmitigated brag accompanied by unmitigated gullibility, giving shell-shocked Europe to understand that a rich bumpkin had come to town with his pockets bulging and no desire except to please.\"<ref>Ronald Steel, ''Walter Lippmann and the American Century.''

It also worked with the post office to censor seditious counter-propaganda.   Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men.  CPI created colorful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.<ref>Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America\u2019s Persuaders'' (1999)</ref> Movie theaters were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and even logging camps. Speeches were mostly in English, but ethnic groups were reached in their own languages.   Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.  The speakers attended training sessions through local universities, and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty Bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.<ref>Lisa Mastrangelo,  \"World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation.\" ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' 12#4 (2009): 607-633.</ref>  Historians were assigned to write pamphlets and in-depth histories of the causes of the European war.<ref>George T.

In his memoirs, Creel claimed that the CPI routinely denied false or undocumented atrocity reports, fighting the crude propaganda efforts of \"patriotic organizations\" like the [[National Security League]] and the [[American Defense Society]] that preferred \"general thundering\" and wanted the CPI to \"preach a gospel of hate.\"<ref>Creel, 195-6</ref>\n\nThe committee used newsprint, posters, radio, telegraph, and movies to broadcast its message. It recruited about 75,000 \"[[Four Minute Men]],\" volunteers who spoke about the war at social events for an ideal length of four minutes. They covered the draft, rationing, war bond drives, victory gardens and why America was fighting. They were advised to keep their message positive, always use their own words and avoid \"hymns of hate.\"<ref>Thomas Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I.''

Tobin and Percy W. Bidwell, ''Mobilizing Civilian America'', New York: Council on Foreign Relations.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In November 1916, the slogan of Wilson's supporters, 'He Kept Us Out Of War,' played an important part in winning the election. At that time a large part of the country was apathetic.... Yet, within a very short period after America had joined the belligerents, the nation appeared to be enthusiastically and overwhelmingly convinced of the justice of the cause of the Allies, and unanimously determined to help them win. The revolutionary change is only partly explainable by a sudden explosion of latent anti-German sentiment detonated by the declaration of war. Far more significance is to be attributed to the work of the group of zealous amateur propagandists, organized under Mr. George Creel in the Committee on Public Information. With his associates he planned and carried out what was perhaps the most effective job of large-scale war propaganda which the world had ever witnessed.}}\n\n===Organizational structure===\nDuring its lifetime, the organization had over twenty bureaus and divisions, with commissioner's offices in nine foreign countries.<ref name = \"Image2\">{{cite book| last =Jackall| first =Robert|author2=Janice M Hirota| year =2003| title =Image Makers: Advertising, Public Relations, and the Ethos of Advocacy| publisher =University of Chicago Press| location =| isbn =978-0-226-38917-2| page = 14}}</ref>\n\nBoth a News Division and a Films Division were established to help get out the war message. The CPI's daily newspaper, called the ''Official Bulletin'', began at eight pages and grew to 32. It was distributed to every newspaper, post office, government office, and military base.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pp. 118-119.</ref> Stories were designed to report positive news. For example, the CPI promoted an image of well-equipped US troops preparing to face the Germans that were belied by the conditions visiting Congressmen reported.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 173.</ref> The CPI released three feature-length films: ''Pershing's Crusaders'' (May 1918), ''America's Answer (to the Hun)'' (August 1918), ''Under Four Flags'' (November 1918). They were unsophisticated attempts to impress the viewer with snippets of footage from the front, far less sensational than the \"crudely fantastical\" output of Hollywood in the same period.<ref>Thomas Doherty, ''Projections of War: Hollywood, American Culture, and World War II'' (NY: Columbia University Press, 1999), 89-91. Hollywood's films \"served to discredit not only the portrayal of war on screen but the whole enterprise of cinematic propaganda.\" Hollywood titles included ''Escaping the Hun'', ''To Hell with the Kaiser!'', and ''The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin''.</ref>\n\nTo reach those Americans who might not read newspapers, attend meetings or watch movies, Creel created the Division of Pictorial Publicity.<ref name=\"gov\">{{Cite web|title=The Most Famous Poster|author=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm015.html|accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref> \nThe Division produced 1438 designs for propaganda posters, cards buttons and cartoons in addition to 20000 ''lantern pictures'' (slides) to be used with the speeches.<ref>Creel, George. ''How we advertised America''. New York & London: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1920. p. 7.</ref>\n[[Charles Dana Gibson]] was America's most popular illustrator {{spaced ndash}} and an ardent supporter of the war. When Creel asked him to assemble a group of artists to help design posters for the government, Gibson was more than eager to help. Famous illustrators such as [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Joseph Pennell]], [[Louis D. Fancher]], and [[N. C. Wyeth]] were brought together to produce some of World War I's most lasting images.\n\n===Media incidents===\nOne early incident demonstrated the dangers of embroidering the truth. The CPI fed newspapers the story that ships escorting the First Division to Europe sank several German submarines, a story discredited when newsmen interviewed the ships' officers in England. Republican Senator [[Boies Penrose]] of Pennsylvania called for an investigation and ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the CPI \"the Committee on Public Misinformation.\"<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pp. 119-120.</ref> The incident turned the once compliant news publishing industry into skeptics.<ref>Mary S. Mander, ''Pen and Sword: American War Correspondents, 1898-1975'' (University of Illinois, 2010), 46. Creel believed his story was correct, but that opponents in the military who were jealous of his control of military information minimized what happened en route.</ref> There is some confusion as to whether or not the claims are correct based upon subsequent information publsihed by the CPI.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Creel|first=George|url=https://archive.org/details/howweadvertiseda01cree|title=How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information that Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe|date=1920|publisher=Harper & Brothers|language=en}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1918, the CPI made a premature announcement that \"the first American built battle planes are today en route to the front in France,\" but newspapers learned that the accompanying pictures were fake, there was only one plane, and it was still being tested.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 173. Creel blamed the Secretary of War for the false story.</ref> At other times, though the CPI could control in large measure what newspapers printed, its exaggerations were challenged and mocked in Congressional hearings.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 240.</ref> The Committee's overall tone also changed with time, shifting from its original belief in the power of facts to mobilization based on hate, like the slogan \"Stop the Hun!\" on posters showing a US soldier taking hold of a German soldier in the act of terrorizing a mother and child, all in support of war bond sales.<ref>Fleming, ''The Illusion of Victory,'' pg. 247.</ref>\n\n===International efforts===\nThe CPI extended its efforts overseas as well and found it had to tailor its work to its audience. In Latin America, its efforts were led where possible by American journalists with experience in the region, because, said one organizer, \"it is essentially a newspaperman's job\" with the principal aim of keeping the public \"informed about war aims and activities.\" The Committee found the public bored with the battle pictures and stories of heroism supplied for years by the competing European powers. In Peru it found there was an audience for photos of shipyards and steel mills. In Chile it fielded requests for information about America's approach to public health, forest protection, and urban policing. In some countries it provided reading rooms and language education.

Sorenson, \"We Become Propagandists,\" in Garth S. Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell (eds.), ''Readings in Propaganda and Persuasion: New and Classic Essays'' (Sage Publications, 2006), p. 88. Asked if he thought all Congressmen were loyal, Creel answered: \"I do not like slumming, so I won't explore into the hearts of Congress for you.\" Wilson later said: \"Gentlemen, when I think of the manner in which Mr. Creel has been maligned and persecuted, I think it is a very human thing for him to have said.\"</ref>\n\n===Termination and disestablishment===\nCommittee work was curtailed after July 1, 1918. Domestic activities stopped after the [[Armistice]] was signed on November 11, 1918. Foreign operations ended June 30, 1919. Wilson abolished the CPI by executive order 3154 on August 21, 1919.\n\nThe Committee on Public Information was formally disestablished by an act of Congress on June 30, 1919, although the organization's work had been formally completed months before.<ref name=CreelIX>Creel, ''How We Advertised America,'' pg. ix.</ref> On August 21, 1919, the disbanded organization's records were turned over to the [[Council of National Defense]].<ref name=CreelIX />\n\n==Memoirs==\nCreel later published his memoirs of his service with the CPI, ''How We Advertised America'', in which he wrote:<ref name = \"War2\">George Creel, ''How We Advertised America.'' New York: Harper & Brothers, 1920; pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n:''In no degree was the Committee an agency of censorship, a machinery of concealment or repression. Its emphasis throughout was on the open and the positive. At no point did it seek or exercise authorities under those war laws that limited the freedom of speech and press. In all things, from first to last, without halt or change, it was a plain publicity proposition, a vast enterprise in salesmanship, the world's greatest adventures in advertising.... We did not call it propaganda, for that word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational and informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was needed than the simple, straightforward presentation of the facts.\n''\nHaha big funny big funny, my father beats me \n\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Walter Lippmann]], a Wilson adviser, journalist, and co-founder of ''[[The New Republic]]'', was a sharp critic of Creel. He had once written an editorial criticizing Creel for violating civil liberties, as Police Commissioner of Denver. Without naming Creel, he wrote in a memo to Wilson that censorship should \"never be entrusted to anyone who is not himself tolerant, nor to anyone who is unacquainted with the long record of folly which is the history of suppression.\" After the war, Lippmann criticized the CPI's work in Europe: \"The general tone of it was one of unmitigated brag accompanied by unmitigated gullibility, giving shell-shocked Europe to understand that a rich bumpkin had come to town with his pockets bulging and no desire except to please.\"<ref>Ronald Steel, ''Walter Lippmann and the American Century.''

University of Alabama Press, 1972, pg. 36</ref>\n\nThe [[Office of Censorship]] in [[World War II]] did not follow the CPI precedent. It used a system of voluntary co-operation with a code of conduct, and it did not disseminate government propaganda.{{r|sweeney2001}}\n\n==Staff==\nAmong those who participated in the CPI's work were:\n* [[Edward Bernays]], a pioneer in public relations and later theorist of the importance of propaganda to democratic governance.<ref>[[W.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.
