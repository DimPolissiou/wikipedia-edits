G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b incorporates both circular and linear movements into its curriculum, combining hard striking attacks such as kicks and close hand punches with softer open hand circular techniques for attacking, blocking, and controlling the opponent, including joint locks, grappling, takedowns, and throws.\n\nMajor emphasis is given to breathing correctly in all of the kata but particularly in the [[Sanchin]] [[kata]] which is one of two core kata of this style.  The second kata is called [[Tensho (kata)|Tensho]], meant to teach the student about the soft style of the system. G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b practices methods that include body strengthening and conditioning, its basic approach to fighting (distance, stickiness, power generation, etc.), and partner drills.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b goes back to [[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], (1853\u20131916), a native of [[Naha, Okinawa]]. Higaonna began studying [[Okinawan martial arts#Shuri-te|Shuri-te]] as a child. He was first exposed to martial arts in 1867 when he began training in [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan]] or \"Arhat boxing\" under [[Arakaki Seish\u014d]], a fluent Chinese speaker and translator for the court of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arakai Seisho|url=http://www.tjska.com/seisho_arakaki.html|website=Traditional Japan Shotokan Karate academy|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Arakaki went to [[Beijing]] to translate for Ryukyuan officials. It was then that he recommended Higaonna to Kojo Taitei, under whom Higaonna began training.\n\nWith the help of Taitei and a family friend, Yoshimura Chomei (who was an Udun or Prince) Higaonna eventually managed to set up safe passage to China, lodging, and martial arts instruction. In 1873 he left for [[Fuzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]], where he began studying Chinese martial arts under various teachers.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA36 p. 36]</ref><ref name=\"p. 14\">Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>\n[[File:Higaonna Kanryo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], c. early 1900s]]\n\nIn 1877 he began to study under [[Ry\u016b Ry\u016b Ko]]. Tokashiki Iken has identified him as Xie Zhongxiang, founder of Whooping Crane Kung Fu. Zhongxiang taught several Okinawan students who went on to become karate legends.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA35 p. 35]</ref> However, since Ryu Ryu Ko had died by 1915 when Chojun Miyagi went to Fuzhou in search of him, and Xie Zhong Xiang died in 1926, the two may not be the same person.\n\nHigaonna returned to Okinawa in 1882 and continued in the family business of selling firewood, while teaching a new school of martial arts, distinguished by its integration of ''g\u014d-no'' (hard) and ''j\u016b-no'' (soft) [[kenp\u014d]] into one system. Higaonna's style was known as a type of Naha-te. Naha-te included other earlier teachers such as Arakaki Seisho and the Kojo family style. However, after Japan annexed Okinawa and defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, the Patron of Naha-te, Yoshimura Udun, and his pro-China faction lost power in Okinawan politics, they migrated to Fuzhou, Taiwan or Hawaii and the older schools of Naha-te were largely lost. Through this period until 1905 when karate was openly taught in Okinawan schools, Kanryo Higaonna kept Naha-te alive by giving students private lessons at his home.\n\nG\u014dj\u016b-kai history considers that [[Shaolin Nam Pai Chuan|''Chinese Nanpa Shorin-ken'']] was the strain of [[kung fu]] that influenced this style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karatedo.co.jp/gojukai/english/e-about.html|title=\u525b\u67d4\u4f1a\u3068\u306f|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHigaonna Morio (no relation with Kanryo's family) noted that in 1905, Higaonna Kanry\u014d taught martial arts in two different ways, according to the type of student: At home, he taught Naha-te as a martial art whose ultimate goal was to be able to kill the opponent; however, at Naha Commercial High School, he taught [[karate]] as a form of physical, intellectual and moral education.<ref>Higaonna, 2001: p. 22</ref>\n\nHigaonna Kanryo's most prominent student was [[Ch\u014djun Miyagi]] (1888\u20131953), the son of a wealthy shop owner in Naha, who began training under Higaonna at the age of 14. Miyagi had begun his martial arts training under Ryuko Arakaki at age 11, and it was through Ryuko Arakaki that he was introduced to Higaonna. Miyagi trained under Higaonna for 15 years until Higaonna's death in 1916.<ref>McCarthy and Lee, 1987: [https://books.google.com/books?id=nquhgEQhVC0C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Miyagi and a friend, Gokenki, went to Fuzhou in search of Higaonna's teacher. They stayed for a year and studied under several masters but the old school was gone due to the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Shortly after their return, Higaonna died. In 1917 Chojun Miyagi once again went to Fuzhou for a short visit to explore local martial arts schools. After he returned, many of Higaonna's students continued to train with Miyagi and he introduced a kata called Tensho around 1918, which he had adapted from Rokkishu of [[Fujian White Crane]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |pages = 28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 delegates from around Japan were meeting in Kyoto for the All Japan Martial Arts Demonstration. Miyagi was unable to attend, and so he in turn asked his top student Jin\u2019an Shinzato to go. While Shinzato was there, one of the other demonstrators asked him the name of the martial art he practiced. At this time, Miyagi had not yet named his style. Not wanting to be embarrassed, Shinzato improvised the name ''hanko-ryu'' (\"half-hard style\"). On his return to [[Okinawa Prefecture]], he reported this incident to Ch\u014djun Miyagi, who decided on the name ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b'' (\"hard soft style\") as a name for his style.<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p.14]</ref><ref>Higaonna, 2001: pp. 67\u201368</ref> Chojun Miyagi took the name from a line of the poem ''Hakku Kenpo'', which roughly means: \"The eight laws of the fist,\" and describes the eight precepts of the martial arts. This poem was part of the ''Bubishi'' and reads, ''Ho wa G\u014dj\u016b wa Donto su'' \"the way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness,\" or \"everything in the universe inhales soft and exhales hard.\"<ref>McCarthy, 1995: p. 160</ref>\n\nIn March 1934, Miyagi wrote ''Karate-do Gaisetsu'' (\"Outline of ''Karate-do'' (Chinese Hand Way)\"), to introduce karate-do and to provide a general explanation of its history, philosophy, and application. This handwritten monograph is one of the few written works composed by Miyagi himself.<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA43 pp. 43-44]</ref>\n\nMiyagi's house was destroyed during [[World War II]]. In 1950, several of his students began working to build a house and dojo for him in Naha, which they completed in 1951. In 1952, they came up with the idea of creating an organization to promote the growth of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b. This organization was called ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Shinkokai'' (\"Association to Promote G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b\"). The founding members were Seko Higa, Keiyo Matanbashi, Jinsei Kamiya, and Genkai Nakaima.<ref>Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA23 p. 23]</ref>\n\nIn 1940 Chojun Miyagi created the kata Geki-Sai-dai-Ichi and Geki-Sai-dai-ni. Geki-sai-dai-Ichi was also incorporated into the Okinawan Karate tradition as Fukyugata-Dai-Ni. Fukyugata-Dai-Ni is practiced by other schools such as Kobayashi Shorin-Ryu and Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu.\n\nThere are two years that define the way G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has been considered by the Japanese establishment: the first, 1933, is the year G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b was officially recognized as a [[bud\u014d]] in Japan by the DNBK [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]], in other words, it was recognized as a modern martial art, or [[gendai bud\u014d]] by the Japanese Government. The second year, 1998, is the year the semi-governmental Nippon Kobudo Kyokai (Japan Traditional Martial Arts Association), under the Cultural Ministry of Japan, recognized G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Karate-do as an ancient form of traditional martial art (''[[kory\u016b]]'') and as a [[Bud\u014d#Bujutsu|bujutsu]].<ref name=\"All Goju Ryu Network\">[http://gojuryu.net/viewpage.php?page_id=33 Kanryo Higaonna \u6771\u6069\u7d0d \u5bdb\u91cf]</ref> This recognition as a ''kory\u016b bujutsu'' shows a change in how [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] sees [[Sino-Japanese relations|the relationships between Japan, Okinawa and China]].\n\nAfter Miyagi's death (1953), the family communicated that the founder of the style wanted [[Eiichi Miyazato]] to succeed him. the Goju Ryu committee, formed by major students of Miyagi (which included among others Nakaima, Madanbashi, Meitoku Yagi, Iha Koshin) at a meeting in February 1954 voted almost unanimously Eiichi Myzato \u200b\u200bas the official successor to Chojun Miyagi.\n\nUntil 1998, the only karate styles recognized as Koryu Bujutsu were newer styles founded in mainland Japan such as Wado Ryu and Itosu Ryu. Goju Ryu was the first style recognized by the NKK(Nippon Kobudo Kyokai), and Goju-Ryu's official representative with the NKK was Morio Higaonna, and the organization he founded, the IOGKF was Goju Ryu's representative organization in the NKK.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMiyagi believed that \"the ultimate aim of karate-do was to build character, conquer human misery, and find spiritual freedom\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref>\n\nHe stated that it was important to balance training for self-defense with \"training the mind, or cultivating the precept ''karate-do ni sente nashi'' ('there is no first strike in karate')\"; he also emphasized the importance of \"cultivating intellect before strength\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA50 p. 50]</ref>\n\nMiyagi chose the name Goju-ryu (\"''go''\" meaning \"hard\" and \"''ju''\" meaning \"soft\"), to emphasize that his style integrated both \"hard\" and \"soft\" styles. ''Goju'' applies not just to karate, but to life in general; only hardness or only softness will not enable one \"to deal effectively with the fluctuations of life\". When blocking, \"the body is soft and inhaling\"; when striking, the body is \"hard and exhaling\".<ref name=\"p. 14\"/>\n\n== Kata ==\nG\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has 12 core [[karate kata|kata]] in its standard curriculum. In some schools, practitioners are required to know all of these kata before reaching ''sandan'' (3rd degree black belt)<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA241 p. 241]</ref> or, more commonly, for ''godan'' (5th degree black belt).\n\n[[Morio Higaonna]] writes that \"Karate begins and ends with ''kata''. ''Kata'' is the essence and foundation of karate and it represents the accumulation of more than 1000 years of knowledge. Formed by numerous masters throughout the ages through dedicated training and research, the ''kata'' are like a map to guide us, and as such should never be changed or tampered with.\"<ref>quoted in Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 12]</ref>\n\nAlmost all of the ''kata'' have a corresponding ''bunkai oyo'', a prearranged two-person fighting drill. These drills help the student to understand the applications of the ''kata'', establish proper rhythm/flow, to practice constant attack/defense, and to safely practice dangerous moves on a partner.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA14 pp. 14-15]</ref>\n\n=== Kihongata ===\nKihongata means a \"kata of basics.\" In G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b, Sanchin kata is the foundation to all other G\u014dj\u016b kata because it teaches basic movements, basic techniques, power generation and breathing techniques from [[qigong]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. It is also the foundation of body conditioning. The more the karateka practices this kata, the more his Heishugata will change. First variation of Sanchin-kata (sanchin kata dai-ichi) serves as Kihongata. See more on [[Sanchin]] kata below.\n\n====Gekisai====\n''Gekisai'' (kanji: \u6483\u7815; katakana: \u30b2\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kugekai.com/kata.html|title=Okinawa Gojuryu Karatedo Kugekai|publisher=}}</ref> means \"attack and destroy\". These kata were created around 1940 by Chojun Miyagi and Nagamine Shoshin as beginners' kata, to introduce the basic forms of karate (''kihon'') to middle school students in Okinawa, to help bring about the standardization of karate, and to teach a basic set of techniques for self-defense.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /><ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA226 p. 226]</ref> ''Gekisai'' kata were strongly influenced by the Shuri-te techniques that Miyagi learned from [[Anko Itosu]].<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref>\n\nStudents first learn ''gekisai dai ichi'' and then ''gekisai dai ni''. The main difference between ''dai ichi'' and ''dai ni'' is that ''dai ni'' introduces open handed techniques and new stances.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /> It is in ''gekesai dai ni'' that students are introduced to the ''neko ashi dachi'' stance, and to the wheel block(mawashe uke).<ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\" />\n\n====Saifa====\n''Saifa'' (Kanji: \u7815\u7834; Katakana: \u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\"/> means \"smash and tear\" or \"smash and destroy\".<ref name=\"toguchi-2001-16\">Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref> ''Saifa'' has its origins in China, and was brought to Okinawa by Higashionna. It contains quick whipping motions, hammerfists, and back fist strikes; it particularly emphasizes moving off-line from an opponent's main force, while simultaneously closing distance and exploding through them.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 15]</ref> This is usually the first advanced G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b kata the students learn in most G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b dojos after gekisai dai ichi and gekisai dai ni.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n====Sanchin====\n''Sanchin'' (Kanji: \u4e09\u6226; Katakana: \u30b5\u30f3\u30c1\u30f3) means \"three battles\". This ''kata'' is a sort of moving [[meditation]], whose purpose is to unify the mind, body and spirit.

G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b incorporates both circular and linear movements into its curriculum, combining hard striking attacks such as kicks and close hand punches with softer open hand circular techniques for attacking, blocking, and controlling the opponent, including joint locks, grappling, takedowns, and throws.\n\nMajor emphasis is given to breathing correctly in all of the kata but particularly in the [[Sanchin]] [[kata]] which is one of two core kata of this style.  The second kata is called [[Tensho (kata)|Tensho]], meant to teach the student about the soft style of the system. G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b practices methods that include body strengthening and conditioning, its basic approach to fighting (distance, stickiness, power generation, etc.), and partner drills.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b goes back to [[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], (1853\u20131916), a native of [[Naha, Okinawa]]. Higaonna began studying [[Okinawan martial arts#Shuri-te|Shuri-te]] as a child. He was first exposed to martial arts in 1867 when he began training in [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan]] or \"Arhat boxing\" under [[Arakaki Seish\u014d]], a fluent Chinese speaker and translator for the court of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arakai Seisho|url=http://www.tjska.com/seisho_arakaki.html|website=Traditional Japan Shotokan Karate academy|accessdate=15 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Arakaki went to [[Beijing]] to translate for Ryukyuan officials. It was then that he recommended Higaonna to Kojo Taitei, under whom Higaonna began training.\n\nWith the help of Taitei and a family friend, Yoshimura Chomei (who was an Udun or Prince) Higaonna eventually managed to set up safe passage to China, lodging, and martial arts instruction. In 1873 he left for [[Fuzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]], where he began studying Chinese martial arts under various teachers.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA36 p. 36]</ref><ref name=\"p. 14\">Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p. 14]</ref>\n[[File:Higaonna Kanryo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Higaonna Kanry\u014d]], c. early 1900s]]\n\nIn 1877 he began to study under [[Ry\u016b Ry\u016b Ko]]. Tokashiki Iken has identified him as Xie Zhongxiang, founder of Whooping Crane Kung Fu. Zhongxiang taught several Okinawan students who went on to become karate legends.<ref>McCarthy, 1995: [https://books.google.com/books?id=lkQsW6DF2owC&pg=PA35 p. 35]</ref> However, since Ryu Ryu Ko had died by 1915 when Chojun Miyagi went to Fuzhou in search of him, and Xie Zhong Xiang died in 1926, the two may not be the same person.\n\nHigaonna returned to Okinawa in 1882 and continued in the family business of selling firewood, while teaching a new school of martial arts, distinguished by its integration of ''g\u014d-no'' (hard) and ''j\u016b-no'' (soft) [[kenp\u014d]] into one system. Higaonna's style was known as a type of Naha-te. Naha-te included other earlier teachers such as Arakaki Seisho and the Kojo family style. However, after Japan annexed Okinawa and defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, the Patron of Naha-te, Yoshimura Udun, and his pro-China faction lost power in Okinawan politics, they migrated to Fuzhou, Taiwan or Hawaii and the older schools of Naha-te were largely lost. Through this period until 1905 when karate was openly taught in Okinawan schools, Kanryo Higaonna kept Naha-te alive by giving students private lessons at his home.\n\nG\u014dj\u016b-kai history considers that [[Shaolin Nam Pai Chuan|''Chinese Nanpa Shorin-ken'']] was the strain of [[kung fu]] that influenced this style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karatedo.co.jp/gojukai/english/e-about.html|title=\u525b\u67d4\u4f1a\u3068\u306f|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHigaonna Morio (no relation with Kanryo's family) noted that in 1905, Higaonna Kanry\u014d taught martial arts in two different ways, according to the type of student: At home, he taught Naha-te as a martial art whose ultimate goal was to be able to kill the opponent; however, at Naha Commercial High School, he taught [[karate]] as a form of physical, intellectual and moral education.<ref>Higaonna, 2001: p. 22</ref>\n\nHigaonna Kanryo's most prominent student was [[Ch\u014djun Miyagi]] (1888\u20131953), the son of a wealthy shop owner in Naha, who began training under Higaonna at the age of 14. Miyagi had begun his martial arts training under Ryuko Arakaki at age 11, and it was through Ryuko Arakaki that he was introduced to Higaonna. Miyagi trained under Higaonna for 15 years until Higaonna's death in 1916.<ref>McCarthy and Lee, 1987: [https://books.google.com/books?id=nquhgEQhVC0C&pg=PA39 p. 39]</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Miyagi and a friend, Gokenki, went to Fuzhou in search of Higaonna's teacher. They stayed for a year and studied under several masters but the old school was gone due to the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Shortly after their return, Higaonna died. In 1917 Chojun Miyagi once again went to Fuzhou for a short visit to explore local martial arts schools. After he returned, many of Higaonna's students continued to train with Miyagi and he introduced a kata called Tensho around 1918, which he had adapted from Rokkishu of [[Fujian White Crane]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Bishop |first = Mark |title = Okinawan Karate |year = 1989 |isbn =0-7136-5666-2 |pages = 28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 delegates from around Japan were meeting in Kyoto for the All Japan Martial Arts Demonstration. Miyagi was unable to attend, and so he in turn asked his top student Jin\u2019an Shinzato to go. While Shinzato was there, one of the other demonstrators asked him the name of the martial art he practiced. At this time, Miyagi had not yet named his style. Not wanting to be embarrassed, Shinzato improvised the name ''hanko-ryu'' (\"half-hard style\"). On his return to [[Okinawa Prefecture]], he reported this incident to Ch\u014djun Miyagi, who decided on the name ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b'' (\"hard soft style\") as a name for his style.<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA14 p.14]</ref><ref>Higaonna, 2001: pp. 67\u201368</ref> Chojun Miyagi took the name from a line of the poem ''Hakku Kenpo'', which roughly means: \"The eight laws of the fist,\" and describes the eight precepts of the martial arts. This poem was part of the ''Bubishi'' and reads, ''Ho wa G\u014dj\u016b wa Donto su'' \"the way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness,\" or \"everything in the universe inhales soft and exhales hard.\"<ref>McCarthy, 1995: p. 160</ref>\n\nIn March 1934, Miyagi wrote ''Karate-do Gaisetsu'' (\"Outline of ''Karate-do'' (Chinese Hand Way)\"), to introduce karate-do and to provide a general explanation of its history, philosophy, and application. This handwritten monograph is one of the few written works composed by Miyagi himself.<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA43 pp. 43-44]</ref>\n\nMiyagi's house was destroyed during [[World War II]]. In 1950, several of his students began working to build a house and dojo for him in Naha, which they completed in 1951. In 1952, they came up with the idea of creating an organization to promote the growth of G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b. This organization was called ''G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Shinkokai'' (\"Association to Promote G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b\"). The founding members were Seko Higa, Keiyo Matanbashi, Jinsei Kamiya, and Genkai Nakaima.<ref>Toguchi, 2001: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zfFaPBlINPwC&pg=PA23 p. 23]</ref>\n\nIn 1940 Chojun Miyagi created the kata Geki-Sai-dai-Ichi and Geki-Sai-dai-ni. Geki-sai-dai-Ichi was also incorporated into the Okinawan Karate tradition as Fukyugata-Dai-Ni. Fukyugata-Dai-Ni is practiced by other schools such as Kobayashi Shorin-Ryu and Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu.\n\nThere are two years that define the way G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has been considered by the Japanese establishment: the first, 1933, is the year G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b was officially recognized as a [[bud\u014d]] in Japan by the DNBK [[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]], in other words, it was recognized as a modern martial art, or [[gendai bud\u014d]] by the Japanese Government. The second year, 1998, is the year the semi-governmental Nippon Kobudo Kyokai (Japan Traditional Martial Arts Association), under the Cultural Ministry of Japan, recognized G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Karate-do as an ancient form of traditional martial art (''[[kory\u016b]]'') and as a [[Bud\u014d#Bujutsu|bujutsu]].<ref name=\"All Goju Ryu Network\">[http://gojuryu.net/viewpage.php?page_id=33 Kanryo Higaonna \u6771\u6069\u7d0d \u5bdb\u91cf]</ref> This recognition as a ''kory\u016b bujutsu'' shows a change in how [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] sees [[Sino-Japanese relations|the relationships between Japan, Okinawa and China]].\n\nAfter Miyagi's death (1953), the family communicated that the founder of the style wanted [[Eiichi Miyazato]] to succeed him. the Goju Ryu committee, formed by major students of Miyagi (which included among others Nakaima, Madanbashi, Meitoku Yagi, Iha Koshin) at a meeting in February 1954 voted almost unanimously Eiichi Myzato \u200b\u200bas the official successor to Chojun Miyagi.\n\nUntil 1998, the only karate styles recognized as Koryu Bujutsu were newer styles founded in mainland Japan such as Wado Ryu and Itosu Ryu. Goju Ryu was the first style recognized by the NKK(Nippon Kobudo Kyokai), and Goju-Ryu's official representative with the NKK was Morio Higaonna, and the organization he founded, the IOGKF was Goju Ryu's representative organization in the NKK.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMiyagi believed that \"the ultimate aim of karate-do was to build character, conquer human misery, and find spiritual freedom\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref>\n\nHe stated that it was important to balance training for self-defense with \"training the mind, or cultivating the precept ''karate-do ni sente nashi'' ('there is no first strike in karate')\"; he also emphasized the importance of \"cultivating intellect before strength\".<ref>McCarthy, 1999: [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Zwwx79TG5YC&pg=PA50 p. 50]</ref>\n\nMiyagi chose the name Goju-ryu (\"''go''\" meaning \"hard\" and \"''ju''\" meaning \"soft\"), to emphasize that his style integrated both \"hard\" and \"soft\" styles. ''Goju'' applies not just to karate, but to life in general; only hardness or only softness will not enable one \"to deal effectively with the fluctuations of life\". When blocking, \"the body is soft and inhaling\"; when striking, the body is \"hard and exhaling\".<ref name=\"p. 14\"/>\n\n== Kata ==\nG\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b has 12 core [[karate kata|kata]] in its standard curriculum. In some schools, practitioners are required to know all of these kata before reaching ''sandan'' (3rd degree black belt)<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA241 p. 241]</ref> or, more commonly, for ''godan'' (5th degree black belt).\n\n[[Morio Higaonna]] writes that \"Karate begins and ends with ''kata''. ''Kata'' is the essence and foundation of karate and it represents the accumulation of more than 1000 years of knowledge. Formed by numerous masters throughout the ages through dedicated training and research, the ''kata'' are like a map to guide us, and as such should never be changed or tampered with.\"<ref>quoted in Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA15 p. 12]</ref>\n\nAlmost all of the ''kata'' have a corresponding ''bunkai oyo'', a prearranged two-person fighting drill. These drills help the student to understand the applications of the ''kata'', establish proper rhythm/flow, to practice constant attack/defense, and to safely practice dangerous moves on a partner.<ref>Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA14 pp. 14-15]</ref>\n\n=== Kihongata ===\nKihongata means a \"kata of basics.\" In G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b, Sanchin kata is the foundation to all other G\u014dj\u016b kata because it teaches basic movements, basic techniques, power generation and breathing techniques from [[qigong]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. It is also the foundation of body conditioning. The more the karateka practices this kata, the more his Heishugata will change. First variation of Sanchin-kata (sanchin kata dai-ichi) serves as Kihongata. See more on [[Sanchin]] kata below.\n\n====Gekisai====\n''Gekisai'' (kanji: \u6483\u7815; katakana: \u30b2\u30ad\u30b5\u30a4)<ref name=\"kugekai.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kugekai.com/kata.html|title=Okinawa Gojuryu Karatedo Kugekai|publisher=}}</ref> means \"attack and destroy\". These kata were created around 1940 by Chojun Miyagi and Nagamine Shoshin as beginners' kata, to introduce the basic forms of karate (''kihon'') to middle school students in Okinawa, to help bring about the standardization of karate, and to teach a basic set of techniques for self-defense.<ref name=\"kane-wilder-241\" /><ref name=\"kane-wilder-226\">Kane & Wilder, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwjtqbXTLqwC&pg=PA226 p. 226]</ref> ''Gekisai'' kata were strongly influenced by the Shuri-te techniques that Miyagi learned from [[Anko Itosu]].<ref>Toguchi, 1976: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8aMQz0B5W4oC&pg=PA16 p. 16]</ref>\n\nStudents first learn ''gekisai dai ichi'' and then ''gekisai dai ni''.

He would make them train very hard, and many of them quit before learning ''sanchin''. Those that remained would focus almost exclusively on ''sanchin'' for two to three years.

The population was 18,555 as of the 2010 census. The city is home to a [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] that is not related to the worldwide [[Burger King]] chain.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nOne of the main factors determining the settlement of Mattoon and [[Coles County]] in general was the topography. Coles County straddled a timberline in the southern half and [[prairie]] in the north. The forested areas were primarily fed by two major rivers: the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]] in the east and the Kaskaskia in the west. The prairie, known as the \"Grand Prairie\", was generally wet and swampy. An early historian described the geography:\n\n\"Away from the timber to the north, the face of the country is generally quite level, broken only by long undulations. It is almost entirely prairie land in this part, and was allowed to remain uncultivated until after the opening of the railroads. It was largely used for pasturage during this period, and often presented signs of great animation as the herds of cattle, under the care of their drovers, moved about over its grassy, slightly undulating surface.\"<ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ilcoletp/history/history_of/history_of_coles_county.htm|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001631/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ilcoletp/history/history_of/history_of_coles_county.htm|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nGroves could be found scattered throughout the area. Early settlers to the area started homesteads in the timberline, which provided building materials  and fuel. Since the vast majority of early settlers came from wooded areas of [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]] (by way of the Ohio and Wabash River valleys), the forests also provided a sense of familiarity.\n\nIn 1826, Kentucky \u00e9migr\u00e9 Charles Sawyer became the first white man known to settle in the Mattoon area, just north of the timberline (known as the Wabash Point Timber) along the Little Wabash River. Levi Doty built Sawyer's cabin while the latter returned to Kentucky to retrieve the rest of his family. Within a year, a few families very quickly settled around Sawyer in the area of Paradise Township, including Dr. John Epperson, the county's first physician. Settlers built log cabins using pegs (no iron or nails). \"The luxuries of life were generally not seen the first years of the settlement, but appeared as the residents could obtain them.\"<ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\"/>\n\n[[Corn]] was planted and remained a staple crop. Gardens of potatoes and other vegetables were maintained. Hogs, which ran wild in the woods, provided pork, while \"deer, bears, wild turkeys, and prairie chickens provided an abundant supply of wild meat.\" Wolves proved troublesome to domesticated animals.<ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\"/>\n\nThe first school was established in 1827\u201328 in the [[Paradise Township, Coles County, Illinois|Paradise Township]], taking place in a makeshift cabin and taught by James Waddill. The costs were $2.50-3.00 per student. School was maintained in this location until 1844\u201345, when the first real schoolhouse was built in what would become Mattoon. That year, the Illinois State Legislature passed its first school laws, making Mattoon a forerunner for early education in the state.\n\nAs the population grew, demand for a local government increased. On Christmas Day, 1830, Coles County was established. The county was named after [[Edward Coles]], the second governor in Illinois who served from 1822 to 1826.<ref name=\"Coles County, Illinois\">{{cite web|url=http://www.co.coles.il.us/genInfo.html|title=Coles County, Illinois|website=www.co.coles.il.us|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915003402/http://www.co.coles.il.us/genInfo.html|archivedate=15 September 2017}}</ref> Settlers in the Mattoon area remained poor and humble, but their community remained close knit.\n\nIn 1836, \"Old State Road\", which runs along the southern end of town, became one of the first trails to be established in the Mattoon area. Another trail, the Kaskaskia Pass, traveled past what was known as \"The Lone Elm Tree\", a natural landmark that helped guide visitors and newcomers. The tree was cut down on August 1, 1950, due to disease. A plaque at the corner of 32nd Street and Western Avenue marks the location of this important landmark.\n\n===1850\u20131900===\n[[File:Starr Hotel in Mattoon.jpg|right|thumb|Starr Hotel, built in 1888 and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]\n[[File:Unity Church in Mattoon.jpg|right|thumb|Unity Church, erected in 1872 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places]]\nThe growth and subsequent history of Mattoon is tied to that of local [[railroad]]s.<ref>[http://mattoonhistory.home.mchsi.com/ Mattoon History Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108034120/http://mattoonhistory.home.mchsi.com/ |date=2011-01-08 }} Accessed January 12, 2013</ref> In 1854, railroad surveyors from the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] and Terre Haute and Alton Railroad found their railroads would cross in the Mattoon area, and a burst of investment and land [[speculation]] began. The two railroads raced to the meeting point, on the understanding that the first to arrive would not have to pay to maintain the crossing. The community that had grown in the area of swamp grass and prairie came to be known as \"Pegtown\", which referred to the pegs (stakes) used to demarcate lots to be sold at public auction. Among the speculators were Elisha Linder, Ebenezer Noyes, James T. Cunningham, Stephen D. Dole, John L. Allison, and John Cunningham.  Land was purchased for $2.50 per acre. On December 12, 1854, County Surveyor John Meadows laid out the town.\n\nThe 1850s saw a flurry of activity for the emerging town. In 1855, the first houses were built. Benjamin Turney used 16 yoke of oxen to drag his home from a farm three miles away, while R. H. McFadden built his home near the area of present-day First Street and Prairie Avenue. In May that year, \"Pegtown\" lots were auctioned. On June 9, 1855, the first train arrived on the Terre Haute Alton Railroad.<ref name=\"Coles County, Illinois\"/> In July, the Pennsylvania House became the first hotel in town, operating at the present-day 1600 block of Broadway Avenue. That month the first post office was established, with James M. True serving as postmaster. In September, Rev. Isaac Hart performed the town's first wedding, marrying Sarah Norvell and R. H. McFadden.\n\nThe next year, 1856, saw the creation of the first newspaper. The weekly \"Independent Gazette\" published four page, seven-column editions. In that same year, the first public school was established (at 1307 Champaign Ave.). In 1856, the first two babies were born in Mattoon, Charles Cartmell in July and Mollie Puff in September. By now, the rapidly growing town had more than 100 buildings. Between 1856\u201357, the first Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, Christian, and Presbyterian churches were formed.\n\nIn May 1857, residents voted to incorporate the town, with 65 votes for and 25 votes against. Also in 1857, ordinances passed forbidding drunkenness, working on Sunday, disturbing public or religious meetings, gaming, leaving carcasses on the streets, littering, obstructing sidewalks, and driving fast horses. In 1858, the first public park was created with a land deed from John Allison and James and John Cunningham. The park remains and is today called Allison\u2013Cunningham Park.\n\nOn the night before the fourth [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate]] of September 18, 1858, at the [[Coles County]] Fairgrounds, both [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] slept in nearby Mattoon,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colescounty.net/history_lincoln.html|title=colescounty.net|website=www.colescounty.net|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215120537/http://www.colescounty.net/history_lincoln.html|archivedate=15 December 2004}}</ref> Lincoln slept in the Essex House hotel, a popular hotel in those times. He addressed a small crowd from his hotel room. The Essex House, the third brick building in town, opened on the southwest corner of the railroad intersection with Union Station located on the lower story. The Essex House served as hotel, restaurant, and ticket office for both railroads. Later, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] would also use the hotel. Today, the mural \"Civility\" (2009), located in Progress Square, commemorates the arrival of the railroad and depicts the Essex House and both Lincoln and Douglas. \"The Lone Elm Tree\" occupies the center of the mural.\n\nIn 1861, the town was officially named after William B. Mattoon, the chief construction engineer working for the Terre Haute and Alton Railroad and partner of the Massachusetts firm \"Phelps, Mattoon, and Barnes.\" The reason for the honor is unclear; some say he won the naming rights because his rail crew arrived first. Others say he beat other claimants in a card game, or that Pegtown residents hoped the wealthy Mattoon would invest in the town if they named it after him. With its combination of excellent transportation and remarkably fertile [[prairie]] soils, Mattoon expanded rapidly. By the dawn of the 20th century, Mattoon's growing population and rail access brought manufacturing and industry.\n\nOn June 17, 1861, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] took his first post of the [[American Civil War]] when he assumed command of the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|21st Illinois Infantry]] in Mattoon. The flagpole from General Grant's camp was preserved and is on display at the Mattoon Public Library.\n\nIn 1865, [[Amish]] settlers began a community to the north near [[Arthur, Illinois|Arthur]]. Amish farm stands and horse-drawn buggies are not uncommon sights in the northern part of Mattoon today.\n\nIn the 1890s, Mattoon led the successful campaign to have a proposed college in eastern Illinois located in Coles County. The citizens were chagrined when neighboring [[Charleston, Illinois|Charleston]] was chosen as the home of the future [[Eastern Illinois University]] instead.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Mattoon Illinois tornado damage.jpg|right|thumb|1917 tornado damage in Mattoon]]\nOn May 26, 1917, the town was devastated by an [[Fujita scale|F4 tornado]] which killed 101 people and injured approximately 638 people. The tornado was Illinois' third deadliest tornado disaster.<ref>The Mattoon/Charleston Tornado of May 26, 1917 from the National Weather Service {{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/ilx/mto1917 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526061900/http://www.weather.gov/ilx/mto1917 |archivedate=2015-05-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the Kuehne Manufacturing Co. began producing dinette sets at their new plant on the south side of Mattoon. Its early sets were wooden, but by the 1950s Kuehne was making the chromed metal breakfast-room sets so popular during that decade. The company closed in 1965. Today, Kuehne dinette sets are prized by collectors of [[mid-century modern]] furniture. \n \nThe 1940 discovery of [[petroleum]] reserves near Mattoon led to a small \"oil boom\" over the next two decades, bringing with it economic benefits and increased civic pride.  Oil extraction continues to be an important economic activity.\n\nMattoon was the site of the \"[[The Mad Gasser of Mattoon|Mad Gasser]]\" attacks of the 1940s.\n\nIn 1966, [[Lake Land College]] was built just south of the city.  The [[community college]] offers degrees for immediate employment and pre-university education.\n\nThe [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] &mdash; unrelated to the Florida-based fast food chain [[Burger King]] &mdash; is a Mattoon restaurant whose owners claim it is the \"original\" Burger King. In 1968, they sued the national chain Burger King, producing a well-known case in United States trademark law. The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal trademark registration has priority over state law, giving the national Burger King chain rights to the name beyond a 20-mile radius around the original Burger King. Today, the closest Burger King franchise location is 25 miles away in [[Tuscola, Illinois]].\n\nMattoon was home to several minor-league baseball teams in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last stadium, with about 2,000 seats, was torn down in the late 1950s. Today, the city has a thriving junior league and has hosted many junior league regionals and World Series.\n\n===21st century===\nTraditionally a bastion of manufacturing, Mattoon has lost several major plants in the last two decades. On December 18, 2007, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] chose the city as the site of its [[FutureGen]] project, a [[zero emission|zero-emissions]] coal-fueled [[power plant]] that was to make hydrogen and electricity while using [[carbon capture and storage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/futuregen/|title=Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management - Department of Energy|website=www.fossil.energy.gov|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215171039/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/futuregen/|archivedate=15 February 2013}}</ref> Three years later, the city rejected the proposal after DoE announced its intention to retrofit an existing power plant in Meredosia instead of building a new one in Mattoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/illinois-town-backs-out-o_n_679344.html|title=2|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307232544/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/illinois-town-backs-out-o_n_679344.html|archivedate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Mattoon native Clyde D. Hood was indicted for the [[Omega Trust]] scam, a 1994-95 scam that brought in around $10 million and was one of the largest in U.S. history. Hood and accomplices bought businesses in the Mattoon area, including the Blue Bird Diner, a longtime family favorite in the small town.\n\nIn 2009, the America's Power Factuality Tour stopped at Mattoon to report on its role in generating electricity in the United States.<ref name=\"Factuality Tour\">{{cite web|url=http://factualitytour.americaspower.org/mattoon-illinois-future-clean-coal-technology|title=America's Power Factuality Tour 2009|accessdate=2009-08-27}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe 1986 arrival of the [[Lender's Bagels]] factory led Mattoon to dub itself the \"[[Bagel]] Capital of the World.\" Home to the world's largest bagel, the town holds a weeklong family festival, \"Lenders Bagelfest\", at the end of July. The main event is a 3-day weekend festival held in Peterson Park near downtown, featuring food and craft vendors, local organizations, rides such as the [[Ferris wheel]] and the [[Tilt-A-Whirl]], and morning community events such as The Big Bagel Breakfast and Bagel Bingo. A beauty pageant crowns winners in various age groups, who ride in the parade held on the Saturday morning of the event. The festival features concerts by local and national musicians. In 2009, [[Zac Brown Band]] headlined the festival; others have included [[Night Ranger]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], [[Jason Aldean]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Travis Tritt]], and [[Ronnie Milsap]]. There is also a Christian night featuring contemporary Christian musicians such as [[Building 429]] and [[Remedy Drive]].\n\nOn January 15, 2020, LSC Communications announced they would be closing their Mattoon facility.

Heading south on I-57 there is an impressive vista from the top of the moraine at the south Mattoon exit. While the moraine is of Wisconsinan age (about 10,000 years before present), the land to the south is of Illinoian age (about 100,000 years before present). The small [[oil field]] to the south of the moraine is also attributed to glacial activity: The weight of the glacier to the north created cracks in the underlying bedrock. Oil collected adjacent to these cracks.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 5737\n|1890= 6833\n|1900= 9622\n|1910= 11456\n|1920= 13552\n|1930= 14631\n|1940= 15827\n|1950= 17547\n|1960= 19088\n|1970= 19681\n|1980= 19293\n|1990= 18441\n|2000= 18291\n|2010= 18555\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=17729\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nMattoon is a principal city of the [[Charleston, Illinois|Charleston]]&ndash;Mattoon [[Charleston-Mattoon micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nPer the [[2010 United States Census]], Mattoon had 18,555 people.

[[Coles County, Illinois]], United States. The population was 18,555 as of the 2010 census. The city is home to a [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] that is not related to the worldwide [[Burger King]] chain.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nOne of the main factors determining the settlement of Mattoon and [[Coles County]] in general was the topography. Coles County straddled a timberline in the southern half and [[prairie]] in the north. The forested areas were primarily fed by two major rivers: the [[Embarras River (Illinois)|Embarras River]] in the east and the Kaskaskia in the west. The prairie, known as the \"Grand Prairie\", was generally wet and swampy. An early historian described the geography:\n\n\"Away from the timber to the north, the face of the country is generally quite level, broken only by long undulations. It is almost entirely prairie land in this part, and was allowed to remain uncultivated until after the opening of the railroads. It was largely used for pasturage during this period, and often presented signs of great animation as the herds of cattle, under the care of their drovers, moved about over its grassy, slightly undulating surface.\"<ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ilcoletp/history/history_of/history_of_coles_county.htm|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=www.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001631/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ilcoletp/history/history_of/history_of_coles_county.htm|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nGroves could be found scattered throughout the area. Early settlers to the area started homesteads in the timberline, which provided building materials  and fuel. Since the vast majority of early settlers came from wooded areas of [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]] (by way of the Ohio and Wabash River valleys), the forests also provided a sense of familiarity.\n\nIn 1826, Kentucky \u00e9migr\u00e9 Charles Sawyer became the first white man known to settle in the Mattoon area, just north of the timberline (known as the Wabash Point Timber) along the Little Wabash River. Levi Doty built Sawyer's cabin while the latter returned to Kentucky to retrieve the rest of his family. Within a year, a few families very quickly settled around Sawyer in the area of Paradise Township, including Dr. John Epperson, the county's first physician. Settlers built log cabins using pegs (no iron or nails). \"The luxuries of life were generally not seen the first years of the settlement, but appeared as the residents could obtain them.\"<ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\"/>\n\n[[Corn]] was planted and remained a staple crop. Gardens of potatoes and other vegetables were maintained. Hogs, which ran wild in the woods, provided pork, while \"deer, bears, wild turkeys, and prairie chickens provided an abundant supply of wild meat.\" Wolves proved troublesome to domesticated animals.<ref name=\"rootsweb.ancestry.com\"/>\n\nThe first school was established in 1827-28 in the [[Paradise Township, Coles County, Illinois|Paradise Township]], taking place in a makeshift cabin and taught by James Waddill. The costs were $2.50-3.00 per student. School was maintained in this location until 1844-45, when the first real schoolhouse was built in what would become Mattoon. That year, the Illinois State Legislature passed its first school laws, making Mattoon a forerunner for early education in the state.\n\nAs the population grew, demand for a local government increased. On Christmas Day, 1830, Coles County was established. The county was named after [[Edward Coles]], the second governor in Illinois who served from 1822 to 1826.<ref name=\"Coles County, Illinois\">{{cite web|url=http://www.co.coles.il.us/genInfo.html|title=Coles County, Illinois|website=www.co.coles.il.us|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915003402/http://www.co.coles.il.us/genInfo.html|archivedate=15 September 2017}}</ref> Settlers in the Mattoon area remained poor and humble, but their community remained close knit.\n\nIn 1836, \"Old State Road\", which runs along the southern end of town, became one of the first trails to be established in the Mattoon area. Another trail, the Kaskaskia Pass, traveled past what was known as \"The Lone Elm Tree\", a natural landmark that helped guide visitors and newcomers. The tree was cut down on August 1, 1950, due to disease. A plaque at the corner of 32nd Street and Western Avenue marks the location of this important landmark.\n\n===1850\u20131900===\n[[File:Starr Hotel in Mattoon.jpg|right|thumb|Starr Hotel, built in 1888 and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]\n[[File:Unity Church in Mattoon.jpg|right|thumb|Unity Church, erected in 1872 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places]]\nThe growth and subsequent history of Mattoon is tied to that of local [[railroad]]s.<ref>[http://mattoonhistory.home.mchsi.com/ Mattoon History Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108034120/http://mattoonhistory.home.mchsi.com/ |date=2011-01-08 }} Accessed January 12, 2013</ref> In 1854, railroad surveyors from the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] and Terre Haute and Alton Railroad found their railroads would cross in the Mattoon area, and a burst of investment and land [[speculation]] began. The two railroads raced to the meeting point, on the understanding that the first to arrive would not have to pay to maintain the crossing. The community that had grown in the area of swamp grass and prairie came to be known as \"Pegtown\", which referred to the pegs (stakes) used to demarcate lots to be sold at public auction. Among the speculators were Elisha Linder, Ebenezer Noyes, James T. Cunningham, Stephen D. Dole, John L. Allison, and John Cunningham.  Land was purchased for $2.50 per acre. On December 12, 1854, County Surveyor John Meadows laid out the town.\n\nThe 1850s saw a flurry of activity for the emerging town. In 1855, the first houses were built. Benjamin Turney used 16 yoke of oxen to drag his home from a farm three miles away, while R. H. McFadden built his home near the area of present-day First Street and Prairie Avenue. In May that year, \"Pegtown\" lots were auctioned. On June 9, 1855, the first train arrived on the Terre Haute Alton Railroad.<ref name=\"Coles County, Illinois\"/> In July, the Pennsylvania House became the first hotel in town, operating at the present-day 1600 block of Broadway Avenue. That month the first post office was established, with James M. True serving as postmaster. In September, Rev. Isaac Hart performed the town's first wedding, marrying Sarah Norvell and R. H. McFadden.\n\nThe next year, 1856, saw the creation of the first newspaper. The weekly \"Independent Gazette\" published four page, seven-column editions. In that same year, the first public school was established (at 1307 Champaign Ave.). In 1856, the first two babies were born in Mattoon, Charles Cartmell in July and Mollie Puff in September. By now, the rapidly growing town had more than 100 buildings. Between 1856-57, the first Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, Christian, and Presbyterian churches were formed.\n\nIn May 1857, residents voted to incorporate the town, with 65 votes for and 25 votes against. Also in 1857, ordinances passed forbidding drunkenness, working on Sunday, disturbing public or religious meetings, gaming, leaving carcasses on the streets, littering, obstructing sidewalks, and driving fast horses. In 1858, the first public park was created with a land deed from John Allison and James and John Cunningham. The park remains and is today called Allison\u2013Cunningham Park.\n\nOn the night before the fourth [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln-Douglas debate]] of September 18, 1858, at the [[Coles County]] Fairgrounds, both [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] slept in nearby Mattoon,.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colescounty.net/history_lincoln.html|title=colescounty.net|website=www.colescounty.net|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215120537/http://www.colescounty.net/history_lincoln.html|archivedate=15 December 2004}}</ref> Lincoln slept in the Essex House hotel, a popular hotel in those times. He addressed a small crowd from his hotel room. The Essex House, the third brick building in town, opened on the southwest corner of the railroad intersection with Union Station located on the lower story. The Essex House served as hotel, restaurant, and ticket office for both railroads. Later, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] would also use the hotel. Today, the mural \"Civility\" (2009), located in Progress Square, commemorates the arrival of the railroad and depicts the Essex House and both Lincoln and Douglas. \"The Lone Elm Tree\" occupies the center of the mural.\n\nIn 1861, the town was officially named after William B. Mattoon, the chief construction engineer working for the Terre Haute and Alton Railroad and partner of the Massachusetts firm \"Phelps, Mattoon, and Barnes.\" The reason for the honor is unclear; some say he won the naming rights because his rail crew arrived first. Others say he beat other claimants in a card game, or that Pegtown residents hoped the wealthy Mattoon would invest in the town if they named it after him. With its combination of excellent transportation and remarkably fertile [[prairie]] soils, Mattoon expanded rapidly. By the dawn of the 20th century, Mattoon's growing population and rail access brought manufacturing and industry.\n\nOn June 17, 1861, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] took his first post of the [[American Civil War]] when he assumed command of the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|21st Illinois Infantry]] in Mattoon. The flagpole from General Grant's camp was preserved and is on display at the Mattoon Public Library.\n\nIn 1865, [[Amish]] settlers began a community to the north near [[Arthur, Illinois|Arthur]]. Amish farm stands and horse-drawn buggies are not uncommon sights in the northern part of Mattoon today.\n\nIn the 1890s, Mattoon led the successful campaign to have a proposed college in eastern Illinois located in Coles County. The citizens were chagrined when neighboring [[Charleston, Illinois|Charleston]] was chosen as the home of the future [[Eastern Illinois University]] instead.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Mattoon Illinois tornado damage.jpg|right|thumb|1917 tornado damage in Mattoon]]\nOn May 26, 1917, the town was devastated by an [[Fujita scale|F4 tornado]] which killed 101 people and injured approximately 638 people. The tornado was Illinois' third deadliest tornado disaster.<ref>The Mattoon/Charleston Tornado of May 26, 1917 from the National Weather Service {{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/ilx/mto1917 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526061900/http://www.weather.gov/ilx/mto1917 |archivedate=2015-05-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1932, the Kuehne Manufacturing Co. began producing dinette sets at their new plant on the south side of Mattoon. Its early sets were wooden, but by the 1950s Kuehne was making the chromed metal breakfast-room sets so popular during that decade. The company closed in 1965. Today, Kuehne dinette sets are prized by collectors of [[mid-century modern]] furniture. \n \nThe 1940 discovery of [[petroleum]] reserves near Mattoon led to a small \"oil boom\" over the next two decades, bringing with it economic benefits and increased civic pride.  Oil extraction continues to be an important economic activity.\n\nMattoon was the site of the \"[[The Mad Gasser of Mattoon|Mad Gasser]]\" attacks of the 1940s.\n\nIn 1966, [[Lake Land College]] was built just south of the city.  The [[community college]] offers degrees for immediate employment and pre-university education.\n\nThe [[Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)|Burger King]] &mdash; unrelated to the Florida-based fast food chain [[Burger King]] &mdash; is a Mattoon restaurant whose owners claim it is the \"original\" Burger King. In 1968, they sued the national chain Burger King, producing a well-known case in United States trademark law. The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal trademark registration has priority over state law, giving the national Burger King chain rights to the name beyond a 20-mile radius around the original Burger King. Today, the closest Burger King franchise location is 25 miles away in [[Tuscola, Illinois]].\n\nMattoon was home to several minor-league baseball teams in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last stadium, with about 2,000 seats, was torn down in the late 1950s. Today, the city has a thriving junior league and has hosted many junior league regionals and World Series.\n\n===21st century===\nTraditionally a bastion of manufacturing, Mattoon has lost several major plants in the last two decades. On December 18, 2007, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] chose the city as the site of its [[FutureGen]] project, a [[zero emission|zero-emissions]] coal-fueled [[power plant]] that was to make hydrogen and electricity while using [[carbon capture and storage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/futuregen/|title=Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management - Department of Energy|website=www.fossil.energy.gov|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215171039/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/futuregen/|archivedate=15 February 2013}}</ref> Three years later, the city rejected the proposal after DoE announced its intention to retrofit an existing power plant in Meredosia instead of building a new one in Mattoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/illinois-town-backs-out-o_n_679344.html|title=2|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307232544/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/illinois-town-backs-out-o_n_679344.html|archivedate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Mattoon native Clyde D. Hood was indicted for the [[Omega Trust]] scam, a 1994-95 scam that brought in around $10 million and was one of the largest in U.S. history. Hood and accomplices bought businesses in the Mattoon area, including the Blue Bird Diner, a longtime family favorite in the small town.\n\nIn 2009, the America's Power Factuality Tour stopped at Mattoon to report on its role in generating electricity in the United States.<ref name=\"Factuality Tour\">{{cite web|url=http://factualitytour.americaspower.org/mattoon-illinois-future-clean-coal-technology|title=America's Power Factuality Tour 2009|accessdate=2009-08-27}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe 1986 arrival of the [[Lender's Bagels]] factory led Mattoon to dub itself the \"[[Bagel]] Capital of the World.\" Home to the world's largest bagel, the town holds a weeklong family festival, \"Lenders Bagelfest\", at the end of July. The main event is a 3-day weekend festival held in Peterson Park near downtown, featuring food and craft vendors, local organizations, rides such as the [[Ferris wheel]] and the [[Tilt-A-Whirl]], and morning community events such as The Big Bagel Breakfast and Bagel Bingo. A beauty pageant crowns winners in various age groups, who ride in the parade held on the Saturday morning of the event. The festival features concerts by local and national musicians. In 2009, [[Zac Brown Band]] headlined the festival; others have included [[Night Ranger]], [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]], [[Jason Aldean]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Travis Tritt]], and [[Ronnie Milsap]]. There is also a Christian night featuring contemporary Christian musicians such as [[Building 429]] and [[Remedy Drive]].\n\nOn January 15, 2020, LSC Communications announced they would be closing their Mattoon facility.

The total area is {{convert|61.38|sqkm|sqmi}}.\n\n==Geography==\nMatsudo is located in the far northwestern corner of Chiba Prefecture, bordered by the [[Edo River]] to the west.\n\n===Neighboring municipalities===\nChiba Prefecture\n*[[Ichikawa, Chiba|Ichikawa]]\n*[[Kashiwa, Chiba|Kashiwa]]\n*[[Nagareyama, Chiba|Nagareyama]]\n*[[Kamagaya, Chiba|Kamagaya]]\n[[Saitama Prefecture]]\n*[[Misato, Saitama (city)|Misato (city)]]\n[[Tokyo]]\n*[[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa-ku]]\n*[[Katsushika, Tokyo|Katsushika-ku]]\n\n==History==\nThe area around Matsudo has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and archaeologists have found remains from the [[J\u014dmon period]], as well as [[kofun|burial tumuli]] from the [[Kofun period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area was ''[[tenry\u014d]]'' controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and contained a number of horse ranches providing [[war horse]]s for the Sh\u014dgun's armies. It also developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the Mito Kaido connecting [[Edo]] with [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Matsudo Town was created in [[Higashikatsushika District, Chiba|Higashikatsushika District]] Chiba Prefecture in 1878. Matsudo attained city status on October 1, 1943.\n\nOn September 1, 1954, the neighboring town of Kashiwa merged with neighboring Kogane Town and Tsuchi and Tanaka villages to form the new city of {{nihongo|Tokatsu|\u6771\u845b\u5e02|Tokatsu-shi}}. However, many politicians in Kogane Town were vehemently opposed to the merger, and forced its dissolution on October 15, 1954 with most of former Kogane Town merging with Matsudo instead. Beginning in the 1960s, the rapid economic growth in Japan (and the Tokyo area in particular) led to a construction boom in Matsudo and the development of the area as a major suburb of Tokyo. Matsudo is now the third-largest city in Chiba Prefecture and a major [[bedroom community]] (11th largest city) in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]].\n\n==Economy==\nMatsudo is a regional commercial center and a [[bedroom community]] for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. The city has a mixed industrial base.

The total area is {{convert|61.38|sqkm|sqmi}}.\n\n==Geography==\nMatsudo is located in the far northwestern corner of Chiba Prefecture, bordered by the [[Edo River]] to the west.\n\n===Neighboring municipalities===\nChiba Prefecture\n*[[Ichikawa, Chiba|Ichikawa]]\n*[[Kashiwa, Chiba|Kashiwa]]\n*[[Nagareyama, Chiba|Nagareyama]]\n*[[Kamagaya, Chiba|Kamagaya]]\n[[Saitama Prefecture]]\n*[[Misato, Saitama (city)|Misato (city)]]\n[[Tokyo]]\n*[[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa-ku]]\n*[[Katsushika, Tokyo|Katsushika-ku]]\n\n==History==\nThe area around Matsudo has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and archaeologists have found remains from the [[J\u014dmon period]], as well as [[kofun|burial tumuli]] from the [[Kofun period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area was ''[[tenry\u014d]]'' controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and contained a number of horse ranches providing [[war horse]]s for the Sh\u014dgun\u2019s armies. It also developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the Mito Kaido connecting [[Edo]] with [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Matsudo Town was created in [[Higashikatsushika District, Chiba|Higashikatsushika District]] Chiba Prefecture in 1878. Matsudo attained city status on October 1, 1943.\n\nOn September 1, 1954, the neighboring town of Kashiwa merged with neighboring Kogane Town and Tsuchi and Tanaka villages to form the new city of {{nihongo|Tokatsu|\u6771\u845b\u5e02|Tokatsu-shi}}. However, many politicians in Kogane Town were vehemently opposed to the merger, and forced its dissolution on October 15, 1954 with most of former Kogane Town merging with Matsudo instead. Beginning in the 1960s, the rapid economic growth in Japan (and the Tokyo area in particular) led to a construction boom in Matsudo and the development of the area as a major suburb of Tokyo. Matsudo is now the third-largest city in Chiba Prefecture and a major [[bedroom community]] (11th largest city) in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]].\n\n==Economy==\nMatsudo is a regional commercial center and a [[bedroom community]] for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. The city has a mixed industrial base.
