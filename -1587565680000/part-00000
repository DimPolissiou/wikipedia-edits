{"title_page": "List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2009}}\n{{original research|date=October 2009}}\n{{in-universe|date=October 2009}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE: List of recurring characters in ''The Suite Life of Zack & Cody''}}\nThe following is a '''list of recurring and minor characters''' in the [[List of Disney Channel series|Disney Channel Original Series]] '''''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]'''''. These characters were regularly rotated, often disappearing for long periods during the series.\n\nThe following list of characters has been sorted alphabetically, by first name. Some of the characters had no last name and most were commonly referred to by their first name so this appeared to be the most logical method. In the case of Chef Paolo, who had no known first name, they have been listed by title.\n\n==Tipton staff==<!-- this section is linked from many redirects -->\n\n===Arwin Hawkhauser===\n'''Arwin Quentin Hawkhauser''' (played by [[Brian Stepanek]]) \u2013 Arwin is a wacky [[Greek-American]] inventor who works as a stationary engineer for the Tipton. He is also friends with Zack and Cody and Maddie in the series. He has a massive crush on Carey, as shown in many episodes but is too afraid to act upon it. He hates carrots and is allergic to horses, as shown in \"Free Tippy\". Every time Carey kisses him, he faints, as seen in \"Kisses & Basketball\", \"Bowling\", and \"Going for the Gold\". His affection is also seen by the fact that he has a picture of Carey in his office that lights up when he claps his hands, as well as a cardboard cutout of her, which he claims to his cousin is his wife. Arwin was a professional bowler, as illustrated in \"Bowling\", but quit when he lost his ball of the backswing and hit his mother in the head, shrinking her by a foot during a championship match. He also is known for being obsessed with his mother; as he lived with her for his whole life until she was married and moved out as shown in, \"The Arwin That Came To Dinner\".  Arwin is considered childlike by many characters in the show; he enjoys picture books, sleeps with a sock monkey, and eats a lunch packed by his mother. However, Arwin is much loved by Zack and Cody. A spin-off television series was planned about him, where he goes to live with his sister to help her take care of her children. The series name ideas consisted of \"Arwin\" and \"Housebroken\", though it was never picked up.\n\nArwin makes a guest appearance in [[The Suite Life on Deck]] via webchat on Cody's laptop in the episode \"It's All Greek To Me\". Also in the episode, it's revealed he has a cousin named Milos in Greece (who is also played by Stepanek). In \"Computer Date\", Arwin himself boards the ship and creates a supercomputer dubbed \"Cal\" (until he found out it was female, renaming her \"Callie\") to make the SS ''Tipton'' run more efficiently. However, it all goes downhill when Callie develops romantic feelings for Cody, causing her to go haywire into removing everyone else, and Arwin is forced to shut her down.  In the end of the episode, Arwin attempts to get off the ship by using a giant magnet but it fails and he falls into the ocean, again. In \"A London Carol\", Arwin is mentioned by Mr. Moseby when London goes to the past. Arwin makes his final appearance in \"[[Graduation on Deck]]\", finally meeting the twins' real father Kurt, and briefly claims that he is their stepfather.\n\n===Chef Paolo===\n'''Chef Paolo''' (played by Jerry Kernion) \u2013 An [[Italian-American]] chef of the Tipton, seen in three episodes: \"Heck's Kitchen\", \"Health and Fitness\", and \"Foiled Again\". He is easily very insulted when people dislike his cooking. He is specialized in [[Italian cuisine|Italian food]]. Paolo enjoys eating, and bacon bits were found in his blood during a cholesterol test. Cody helped Chef Paolo overcome his eating issues in the episode \"Health and Fitness\". He is close to Cody and refers to him as \"my little prot\u00e9ge\", because of Cody's natural talent for cooking. Paolo has quit his job several times (mostly due to London insulting his food), but always returns eventually. He names almost all of his foods after himself, except for one named after Cody.\n\n===Chuck===\n'''Chuck''' (played by Dossett March) \u2013 The waiter whom Maddie had a crush on in Season one.\n\n===Grace===\nGrace (played by Brenda Vivian) \u2013 A maid at the Tipton. She attended Cody's party in \"Odd Couples\".\n\n===Esteban===\n'''{{visible anchor|Esteban Ram\u00edrez}}'''<!-- Do not add his full name. It will be reverted. --> (played by [[Adrian R'Mante]]) \u2013 Esteban is the head bellman at the Tipton. His signature quotes are \"This is a disaster!\" and \"Oh Mr. Moseby!\" He is very close to his heritage, which in \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep64|I Want My Mummy]]\" is revealed to be Peruvian. He is friends with Zack and Cody and Maddie. It is revealed during the series that his full name is \"Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ram\u00edrez\". He owns a domestic chicken with blue feet named Dudley, to whom he seems to be quite attached. Esteban wants to manage the Tipton and he is a gifted dancer. He addresses the twins as \"little blond peoples\", even when he is only talking to one of them, in which case he often has to correct himself. Though he frequently does stupid, na\u00efve, or clumsy things, he is smarter than he has given credit for and has a huge heart, displayed many times throughout the series. In the dancing episode, after he and the nurse, Shannon Quine, dance, they are briefly shown kissing. It is also stated he is descended from royalty in several episodes and in one becomes temporarily rich because of his royal family. However, his royal family is deposed. In \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep12|It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel]]\" it is revealed that Esteban has a crush on Carey. He guest-stars on ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'' in which he has his wedding on the [[The Suite Life on Deck|SS ''Tipton'']] with Francesca ([[Marisa Ramirez]]).  It is also revealed in that episode that he has been promoted from bellhop to assistant night manager of the hotel. Despite being a recurring character, Esteban has appeared very often throughout the show, only being absent in a handful of episodes.\n\n===Gary===\n'''Gary''' (played by Rick Sawaya) \u2013 An unfortunate waiter at the Tipton restaurant.\n\n===Grace===\n'''Grace''' (played by Naomi Chan) \u2013 An emotionless towel maid at the Tipton who appeared in \"Ah! Wilderness\" while Carey was painting. In \"Orchestra\", she is given the name Grace and attempts to teach London how to do her job.\n\n===Irene===\n'''Irene''' (played by [[Sharon Jordan]]) \u2013 The [[concierge]] for the Tipton Hotel, Irene is usually seen working in the lobby. She has red curly hair. In \"Boston Tea Party\", she gets her first speaking part. On \"[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]\", Irene told Raven that her flight had been cancelled, much to Raven's dismay. Irene sabotaged Maddie's traveling candy cart in \"Nurse Zack\", to which Maddie alludes to Irene not having very many speaking parts by replying, \"It's always the quiet ones\". In \"Orchestra\", her speaking role was expanded when she had to teach London how to do her job. On \"Let Us Entertain You', Mr. Moseby thinks Irene is answering a phonecall for their marathon, but she is actually answering a personal call.\n\n===Lance===\n'''Lance Fishman''' (played by Aaron Musicant) \u2013 The Tipton's handsome if somewhat slow-witted young lifeguard, who projects a relaxed and easygoing demeanor but harbors an almost unhealthy obsession with water. He is frequently shown in scenes trying to steer even the most mundane everyday conversations to swimming, the ocean or sea creatures in some respect. He disrupts Maddie's student film (\"Back in the Game\") by insisting that she change his character to a [[merman]], and suggesting she replace the front walk with a pool so that he can swim, rather than walk, to the hotel entrance. Later, during London's Halloween party he appears as \"the Mighty Lobster\". Nonetheless, Lance exhibits remarkable ease with picking up women, scoring dates with both Maddie (who at first had a crush on him) and London (despite her aversion to dating \"the help\"). Holding onto said women is another story: Maddie dumps him because she finds him dull, and London agrees to break up with him after he meets a woman called Wanda.\n\n===Millicent===\n'''Millicent''' (played by [[Kara Taitz]]) \u2013 Maddie's replacement at the hotel's candy counter while she is at camp and in Antarctica saving the penguins. Millicent is easily frightened by anything, and has trouble making up her mind and make her decision. When she can't make up her mind, she usually faints. She stated in the episode \"Team Tipton\" that she has trust, abandonment, and fear issues. She frequently faints when overwhelmed with a request from someone else. In the episode \"Team Tipton\", London referred to her as 'Nervous Maddie'.\n\n===Wilfred===\n'''Wilfred Tipton''' (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]) \u2013 Wilfred Tipton is the owner of the Tipton hotel and father to [[London Tipton]]. Until [[The Suite Life on Deck]] episode, \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep68|Twister: Part 3]]\", his face had never been shown. He is usually surrounded by his bodyguards, with only his hand shown. It is not clear how he became the owner of the Tipton, because London mentions many times that her father bought the hotel. However, in a few episodes, it is said that Tipton's ancestors owned the hotel first before he did. This may yet be another example of London's ignorance, or a continuity error or that the Tiptons have not owned it for some time and he bought it back. In the episode \"Rock Star in the House\", Wilfred is very strict about London's behavior when it comes to celebrities, and has much concern for her education and growing as a person. His hand was once seen in the episode \"Lip Synchin' in the Rain\", in which he was wearing a diamond ring. Wilfred Tipton also has a history of marrying much younger women without London's consent, most of whom do not last long. The warranty of Wilfred's wedding gifts (given by Mr. Moseby) lasted longer than the marriages.\n:In ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'' episode, \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#68|Twister: Part 3]]\", Wilfred Tipton (played by [[John Michael Higgins]]) finally reveals himself, who is called by a reluctant Cody trying to rescue the Pickett Farm, although Wilfred Tipton buys the destroyed house to build a plastic bag factory. Cody tries to force Mr. Tipton out of the area by saying the dirt in the area contains powerful diseases, but Zack and Woody ruin the plot when they used peeling skin (Mr. Tipton said he watched a movie involving peeling skin). However, his daughter, London, seeing the strong emotions from the group, blackmails Wilfred. After the blackmail, Mr. Tipton leaves, but says he is proud of London about her.\n\n===Muriel===\n'''Muriel''' (played by [[Estelle Harris]]; young Muriel played by Ashley Tisdale in flashback in the episode \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel\") \u2013 The saucy hotel maid who conceals her goodly nature beneath a veneer of acidic sarcasm, and spends more time sneaking in naps and robbing guests of loose change than doing any actual cleaning. She is a constant presence in Carey and the twins' suite, ostensibly \"babysitting\" but loitering on their couch watching TV and eating chocolates long after Carey has returned home. In \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel\", the cast discovers that Muriel once dated mobster Alphonse \"Hot Peppers\" DeLeo before joining the Tipton in 1938; Maddie and the twins easily spot her in an old newspaper clipping when they notice that the young lady in the picture is sitting with her feet up. In \"Big Hair & Baseball\", Muriel claims that she knew [[Babe Ruth]] and was the first one to call him \"Babe\". Her catchphrase is, \"I'm not cleaning ''that'' up.\". She was specially called out of retirement in the series finale \"Mr Tipton comes to Visit\", by the twins, when they heard the reason for Mr Tipton's visit is to fire an employee, in order for her to \"get fired\" instead (using her catchphrase), sparing the other characters their respective jobs.\n\n===Nia===\n'''Nia Moseby''' (played by [[Giovonnie Samuels]]) \u2013 Nia is Mr. Moseby's niece. She has a part-time job at the candy counter, filling in for Maddie during her absence. She has come to work at the Tipton so that Mr. Moseby can get her to behave like a responsible girl. One of Nia's aunts, named Aunt Lilly, was supposed to take on this task, but Nia frustrated her so much that she changed her name and moved to Alaska. Nia appeared in seven episodes in Season 3. According to Mr. Moseby, she was expelled from her last school for fighting with the cafeteria lady because she was out of [[matzo ball soup]]. In the episode \"First Day of High School\", she is seen defending Zack from a jerk. She is shown to be quite good at cheerleading in the episode \"Benchwarmers\".\n\n===Norman===\n'''Norman''' (played by Anthony Acker) \u2013 The [[doorman (profession)|doorman]] for the Tipton Hotel, Norman's first appearance was in the episode \"Free Tippy\". He is also usually a background character, but is shown to have a hiding spot for Zack's belongings when he skips school in \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep47|What the Hey]]\". Norman has four speaking parts in the episodes, \"Neither a Borrower Nor a Speller Bee', \"Ask Zack', \"Nurse Zack\" and \"The Arwin That Came For Dinner\".\n\n===Patrick===\n'''Patrick''' (played by [[Patrick Bristow]]) \u2013 The [[ma\u00eetre d']] for the Tipton Hotel's [[restaurant]]. One of the most [[sarcastic]] characters on the show, he treats everyone with disdain, especially Zack and Cody. However, in \"Kisses and Basketball\", he says to Zack \"Take this from someone who cares about you, she is so out of your league\" on Zack's date with Max. He likes [[coconut]] flavored [[chewing gum]], and dislikes Maddie because she does not stock it (as shown in the episode \"Big Hair and Baseball\"). He is seen in the Tipton Commercial in \"Commercial Breaks\", and has a girlish shriek, as shown in the episode \"Heck's Kitchen\". Due to London's generous tips, Patrick has been able to afford a foreign sports car (indicated in \"Twins at the Tipton\"). However, Mr. Moseby claims that Patrick wrecked it by crashing into fellow waiter Rich, and when the ambulance showed up, another waiter Gary got hit by the ambulance, leaving Mr. Moseby to take Patrick's place at the Tipton Restaurant. His favorite musical is [[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)]] ''(Bye Bye Birdie'') as revealed in \"Birdman of Boston\".\n\n===Rich===\n'''Rich''' (played by [[Chris Doyle (actor)|Chris Doyle]]) An unfortunate waiter at the Tipton restaurant.

He is portrayed as being very dumb, as made apparent in the same episode when he agreed to get goat milk for a hotel guest calling himself Prince Bapalapashamalamadingdong. The guest was actually Cody.\n\n===Skippy===\n'''Skippy''' (played by Bo Crutcher) \u2013 The night-manager of the Tipton Hotel, he grew up in a farm and said his grandfather was scary. He is not very bright, and appears to be frightened of Mr. Moseby. He is so dim-witted that immediately after Mr. Moseby told him not to let Zack or Cody into the exhibit, he let them in anyway. He first appeared in \"Scary Movie\", but Mr. Moseby called him Sparky, although it is possible that Mr. Moseby did not know his name, because he called him his night-manager while in other episodes he calls him Skippy. Skippy was left in charge of the hotel in the episode \"I Want My Mummy\". Zack says that Skippy is so nice, that he would give anyone anything if they just asked, even his wallet.\n\n===Steve===\n'''Steve''' \u2013 The luggage carrier who first appeared in \"Benchwarmers\".\n\n== Friends of Zack & Cody ==\n\n===Bob===\n'''Bob''' (played by Charlie Stewart) \u2013 One of the boys' best friends.

Bob, as shown in \"Smart & Smarterer\" and \"Odd Couples\", is somewhat impatient. He speaks fluent French, as illustrated in the episode \"French 101\". In the episode, \"Back in the Game\", one of his beliefs is frequent, short naps. In \"Forever Plaid\", he states that his favorite subject is Science. Bob is shown to also be talented in wood shop, creating a very well made rocking chair.

He was [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] in the show's version of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]], is on their basketball team and worked at the boys' club seen in \"Club Twin\" selling soda. Bob is very vulnerable to poison oak, shown in the episode \"Ah! Wilderness\". In the episode \"Super Twins\", he is the first and only child to be adultified by the Meanager (Moseby) \u2013 which causes the twins remark later that he has a booming insurance business. However, this is dropped when Zack turns back time at the end of episode. Bob is Zack and Cody's most frequent friend featured on the show with 16 appearances. He visits Zack and Cody on the SS ''Tipton'' once in [[The Suite Life on Deck]], which reveals he is now dating Cody's ex-girlfriend Barbara.\n\n===Max===\n'''Max''' (played by [[Alyson Stoner]]) \u2013 One of Zack and Cody's friends, she is a girl who usually wears pigtails in Season 1 and is sometimes mistaken for a boy.

She is rude, has a large mole (or \"[[beauty mark]]\") on her face (which is oblivious to her, as she usually replies \"Vat mole?\"), and dislikes Mr. Moseby for making her lose her hotel inspector's job. After \"Hotel Inspector\", she got married. In \"Cookin' With Romeo and Juliet\" she says her name is Ilsa Shickelgrubermeiger-Von Helsinger Kepelugerhoffer. When Cody mentions that it must take forever to write on her underwear, she says she has a stamp. One of her dreams is to turn the Tipton Hotel into a parking lot, and have Mr. Moseby park the cars. In \"Bowling\", it appears that she has an odd sense of humor, as she says, \"Left! Left! Left my husband with 28 kids! Right! Right! Right in the middle of the living room floor!\" Some parts of her personality seem to be reminiscent of the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; for instance, in the episode \"Bowling\" she states, \"I'll get you next time, my pretty, and your little shtaff too!\" She also uses the line, \"I'll get you next time and your little dog too', in the episode \"Hotel Inspector\". In the episode \"Bowling\", Mr. Moseby makes a reference to [[The Biggest Loser]], the show Caroline Rhea hosted, by saying \"Ha! Who's the biggest loser now!\" Also in that episode, she actually compliments Carrie on her parenting skills by keeping Zack off the team as punishment for pranking Cody; however, she then follows it up with the insult that it's also bad coaching as Zack's the second-best bowler the Tipton team had. It is mentioned in a few episodes that she has a [[dachshund|sausage dog]] named [[Blitzkrieg]], who is rather vicious. London likened the dog to a [[piranha]]. Everyone is afraid of her and constantly stares at her mole.\n\n=== The Mirrors ===\n'''The Mirrors''' (voiced by Brian Peck in the original series; and Michael Airington in the [[The Suite Life on Deck|sequel series]]) are London's free-standing talking mirrors (it was mentioned that there are more than one). They first appeared in the season 2 crossover episode [[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]. London stated that the mirrors were engineered by her father's scientists, and that they are programmed to only compliment her fashion while giving snobby fashion insults to others who stand in front of them. The mirror sounds like Paul Lynde who played Uncle Arthur in the series. It is implied several times that the mirrors have artificial intelligence, as they regularly make sarcastic comments about London's intelligence.

These characters were regularly rotated, often disappearing for long periods during the series.\n\nThe following list of characters has been sorted alphabetically, by first name. Some of the characters had no last name and most were commonly referred to by their first name so this appeared to be the most logical method. In the case of Chef Paolo, who had no known first name, they have been listed by title.\n\n==Tipton staff==<!-- this section is linked from many redirects -->\n\n===Arwin Hawkhauser===\n'''Arwin Quentin Hawkhauser''' (played by [[Brian Stepanek]]) \u2013 Arwin is a wacky [[Greek-American]] inventor who works as a stationary engineer for the Tipton. He is also friends with Zack and Cody and Maddie in the series. He has a massive crush on Carey, as shown in many episodes but is too afraid to act upon it. He hates carrots and is allergic to horses, as shown in \"Free Tippy\". Every time Carey kisses him, he faints, as seen in \"Kisses & Basketball\", \"Bowling\", and \"Going for the Gold\". His affection is also seen by the fact that he has a picture of Carey in his office that lights up when he claps his hands, as well as a cardboard cutout of her, which he claims to his cousin is his wife. Arwin was a professional bowler, as illustrated in \"Bowling\", but quit when he lost his ball of the backswing and hit his mother in the head, shrinking her by a foot during a championship match. He also is known for being obsessed with his mother; as he lived with her for his whole life until she was married and moved out as shown in, \"The Arwin That Came To Dinner\".  Arwin is considered childlike by many characters in the show; he enjoys picture books, sleeps with a sock monkey, and eats a lunch packed by his mother. However, Arwin is much loved by Zack and Cody. A spin-off television series was planned about him, where he goes to live with his sister to help her take care of her children. The series name ideas consisted of \"Arwin\" and \"Housebroken\", though it was never picked up.\n\nArwin makes a guest appearance in [[The Suite Life on Deck]] via webchat on Cody's laptop in the episode \"It's All Greek To Me\". Also in the episode, it's revealed he has a cousin named Milos in Greece (who is also played by Stepanek). In \"Computer Date\", Arwin himself boards the ship and creates a supercomputer dubbed \"Cal\" (until he found out it was female, renaming her \"Callie\") to make the SS ''Tipton'' run more efficiently. However, it all goes downhill when Callie develops romantic feelings for Cody, causing her to go haywire into removing everyone else, and Arwin is forced to shut her down.  In the end of the episode, Arwin attempts to get off the ship by using a giant magnet but it fails and he falls into the ocean, again. In \"A London Carol\", Arwin is mentioned by Mr. Moseby when London goes to the past. Arwin makes his final appearance in \"[[Graduation on Deck]]\", finally meeting the twins' real father Kurt, and briefly claims that he is their stepfather.\n\n===Chef Paolo===\n'''Chef Paolo''' (played by Jerry Kernion) \u2013 An [[Italian-American]] chef of the Tipton, seen in three episodes: \"Heck's Kitchen\", \"Health and Fitness\", and \"Foiled Again\". He is easily very insulted when people dislike his cooking. He is specialized in [[Italian cuisine|Italian food]]. Paolo enjoys eating, and bacon bits were found in his blood during a cholesterol test. Cody helped Chef Paolo overcome his eating issues in the episode \"Health and Fitness\". He is close to Cody and refers to him as \"my little prot\u00e9ge\", because of Cody's natural talent for cooking. Paolo has quit his job several times (mostly due to London insulting his food), but always returns eventually. He names almost all of his foods after himself, except for one named after Cody.\n\n===Chuck===\n'''Chuck''' (played by Dossett March) \u2013 The waiter whom Maddie had a crush on in Season one.\n\n===Grace===\nGrace (played by Brenda Vivian) \u2013 A maid at the Tipton. She attended Cody's party in \"Odd Couples\".\n\n===Esteban===\n'''{{visible anchor|Esteban Ram\u00edrez}}'''<!-- Do not add his full name. It will be reverted. --> (played by [[Adrian R'Mante]]) \u2013 Esteban is the head bellman at the Tipton. His signature quotes are \"This is a disaster!\" and \"Oh Mr. Moseby!\" He is very close to his heritage, which in \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep64|I Want My Mummy]]\" is revealed to be Peruvian. He is friends with Zack and Cody and Maddie. It is revealed during the series that his full name is \"Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ram\u00edrez\". He owns a domestic chicken with blue feet named Dudley, to whom he seems to be quite attached. Esteban wants to manage the Tipton and he is a gifted dancer. He addresses the twins as \"little blond peoples\", even when he is only talking to one of them, in which case he often has to correct himself. Though he frequently does stupid, na\u00efve, or clumsy things, he is smarter than he has given credit for and has a huge heart, displayed many times throughout the series. In the dancing episode, after he and the nurse, Shannon Quine, dance, they are briefly shown kissing. It is also stated he is descended from royalty in several episodes and in one becomes temporarily rich because of his royal family. However, his royal family is deposed. In \"[[List of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episodes#ep12|It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel]]\" it is revealed that Esteban has a crush on Carey. He guest-stars on ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'' in which he has his wedding on the [[The Suite Life on Deck|SS ''Tipton'']] with Francesca ([[Marisa Ramirez]]).  It is also revealed in that episode that he has been promoted from bellhop to assistant night manager of the hotel. Despite being a recurring character, Esteban has appeared very often throughout the show, only being absent in a handful of episodes.\n\n===Gary===\n'''Gary''' (played by Rick Sawaya) \u2013 An unfortunate waiter at the Tipton restaurant.\n\n===Grace===\n'''Grace''' (played by Naomi Chan) \u2013 An emotionless towel maid at the Tipton who appeared in \"Ah! Wilderness\" while Carey was painting. In \"Orchestra\", she is given the name Grace and attempts to teach London how to do her job.\n\n===Irene===\n'''Irene''' (played by [[Sharon Jordan]]) \u2013 The [[concierge]] for the Tipton Hotel, Irene is usually seen working in the lobby. She has red curly hair. In \"Boston Tea Party\", she gets her first speaking part. On \"[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]\", Irene told Raven that her flight had been cancelled, much to Raven's dismay. Irene sabotaged Maddie's traveling candy cart in \"Nurse Zack\", to which Maddie alludes to Irene not having very many speaking parts by replying, \"It's always the quiet ones\". In \"Orchestra\", her speaking role was expanded when she had to teach London how to do her job. On \"Let Us Entertain You', Mr. Moseby thinks Irene is answering a phonecall for their marathon, but she is actually answering a personal call.\n\n===Lance===\n'''Lance Fishman''' (played by Aaron Musicant) \u2013 The Tipton's handsome if somewhat slow-witted young lifeguard, who projects a relaxed and easygoing demeanor but harbors an almost unhealthy obsession with water. He is frequently shown in scenes trying to steer even the most mundane everyday conversations to swimming, the ocean or sea creatures in some respect. He disrupts Maddie's student film (\"Back in the Game\") by insisting that she change his character to a [[merman]], and suggesting she replace the front walk with a pool so that he can swim, rather than walk, to the hotel entrance. Later, during London's Halloween party he appears as \"the Mighty Lobster\". Nonetheless, Lance exhibits remarkable ease with picking up women, scoring dates with both Maddie (who at first had a crush on him) and London (despite her aversion to dating \"the help\"). Holding onto said women is another story: Maddie dumps him because she finds him dull, and London agrees to break up with him after he meets a woman called Wanda.\n\n===Millicent===\n'''Millicent''' (played by [[Kara Taitz]]) \u2013 Maddie's replacement at the hotel's candy counter while she is at camp and in Antarctica saving the penguins. Millicent is easily frightened by anything, and has trouble making up her mind and make her decision. When she can't make up her mind, she usually faints. She stated in the episode \"Team Tipton\" that she has trust, abandonment, and fear issues. She frequently faints when overwhelmed with a request from someone else. In the episode \"Team Tipton\", London referred to her as 'Nervous Maddie'.\n\n===Wilfred===\n'''Wilfred Tipton''' (voiced by [[Bob Joles]]) \u2013 Wilfred Tipton is the owner of the Tipton hotel and father to [[London Tipton]]. Until [[The Suite Life on Deck]] episode, \"[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep68|Twister: Part 3]]\", his face had never been shown. He is usually surrounded by his bodyguards, with only his hand shown. It is not clear how he became the owner of the Tipton, because London mentions many times that her father bought the hotel. However, in a few episodes, it is said that Tipton's ancestors owned the hotel first before he did. This may yet be another example of London's ignorance, or a continuity error or that the Tiptons have not owned it for some time and he bought it back.

For this reason they are included in this article.\n\n'''Dudley''' \u2013 Esteban's pet chicken. He appeared on the episode \"Commercial Breaks\". After that, Esteban mentions him in some episodes. He appeared again on \"Suite Life on Deck\",  in the episode \"Mother of the Groom\".\n\n'''Scamp''' (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) \u2013 Maddie's pet dog. In the episode \"Crushed\", he and Ivana, London's dog, fall in love and Ivana has six puppies. When \"talking\" to Ivana he notes that he has one flea but it is only there on weekends.\n\n'''[[London Tipton#Ivana|Ivana]]''' (voiced by [[Emma Stone]]) \u2013 London's spoiled dog. She is a Pomeranian, and appears to be a lot smarter than London. In the episode \"Crushed\", she and Scamp, Maddie's dog, fall in love and she has six puppies. She is a parody of [[Tinkerbell Hilton]].\n\n'''Bonnie and Clyde''' \u2013 Two rats that Zack and Cody used in a science project.\n\n'''Tippy''' \u2013 The horse that pulls the carriage around the hotel.

{"title_page": "Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2010}}\n\n'''The Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference''' is a high school athletic organization, featuring schools from the towns that surround the [[Kennebec River]] in the state of [[Maine]]. It is the largest athletic conference in the state with 29 different schools as members.\n\n==Member schools==\nThe KVAC consists of 29 different schools, which are divided into two divisions in three different classes (Class A, Class B, & Class C) in coordination with the Maine Principals' Association (MPA). Membership includes:\n\nSoccer/Baseball/Softball\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! CLASS A !!

CLASS B\n|-\n| Bangor (N) || Brewer (N) || Belfast (N)\n|-\n| Edward Little (N) || Brunswick (S) || Lincoln (S)\n|-\n| Lewiston (N) || Camden Hills (N) || Maine Central Institute (N)\n|-\n| Oxford Hills (N) || Cony (N) || Maranacook (S)\n|-\n|  || Erskine (N) || Mt.

Members schools and athletes compete for team and individual conference championship status between the end of the regular season and the start of the MPA playoffs.\n\nMembership drastically changed in the early-mid 2000s when schools switched regions and classes. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Class A membership included Waterville, Lawrence, Skowhegan, Mt. Blue, Messalonskee, Cony, Medomak Valley, and Gardiner as Eastern Maine schools and Brunswick, Morse, Mt. Ararat, Oxford Hills, and Leavitt as Western Maine schools in sports like basketball.  The five Western Maine schools were moved into Eastern Maine for the 2001-02 season. This was due to two reasons. One, enrollment at EM schools in more northern parts of the state were dropping and schools like Stearns, Caribou, and later Presque Isle were moving down to Class B (all the way down to Class D in the case of Stearns). Another reason was the MPA's failed four division format where Eastern and Western Maine were split into north/south divisions. That format lasted one year. Edward Little and Lewiston, former members of the Southwestern Maine Activities Association, joined in 2003. That move was followed by the decision to move those schools to Eastern Maine. The KVAC also gained former Class A members of the Big East/Penobscot Valley Conference from the Bangor area in 2005 when that league was forced to disband due to loss of membership. 5 schools, Bangor High School, Brewer High School, Nokomis Regional High School, Old Town High School, and Hampden Academy, joined. Bangor, Brewer, and Hampden continue to be members of the Class A division, while Nokomis moved to Class B, and Old Town moved to Class B, but returned to the Big East/PVC. Erskine has jumped between Classes A and B since 2005 but will move back to B in 2013. Gardiner moved to Class B in 2007. Leavitt and Nokomis dropped to B in 2009, with Leavitt moving to the West. Morse dropped from EM Class A to WM Class B in 2011. Rockland District High School merged with nearby Georges Valley High School in 2011 to form Oceanside East/West High School. Oak Hill High School was a Class B member until 2012 when they moved to the Mountain Valley Conference, a Class B/C league in the western mountains. Erskine moved to Class B in 2013, and Maranacook to Class C. Spruce Mountain High School of Jay, a former member of the Mountain Valley Conference, joined the league for the 2014-15 school year.\n\nStarting with the 2015-16 season, basketball will be divided into five classes and into north and south regions.\n\nThe KVAC also holds an annual banquet in May to recognize 10 Senior Scholars from each of its member schools.\n\n==Cross-Country==\n===Class A Champions===\n====Women====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

It is the largest athletic conference in the state with 29 different schools as members.\n\n==Member schools==\nThe KVAC consists of 29 different schools, which are divided into two divisions in three different classes (Class A, Class B, & Class C) in coordination with the Maine Principals' Association (MPA).

Members schools and athletes compete for team and individual conference championship status between the end of the regular season and the start of the MPA playoffs.\n\nMembership drastically changed in the early-mid 2000s when schools switched regions and classes. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Class A membership included Waterville, Lawrence, Skowhegan, Mt. Blue, Messalonskee, Cony, Medomak Valley, and Gardiner as Eastern Maine schools and Brunswick, Morse, Mt. Ararat, Oxford Hills, and Leavitt as Western Maine schools in sports like basketball.  The five Western Maine schools were moved into Eastern Maine for the 2001-02 season. This was due to two reasons. One, enrollment at EM schools in more northern parts of the state were dropping and schools like Stearns, Caribou, and later Presque Isle were moving down to Class B (all the way down to Class D in the case of Stearns). Another reason was the MPA's failed four division format where Eastern and Western Maine were split into north/south divisions. That format lasted one year. Edward Little and Lewiston, former members of the Southwestern Maine Activities Association, joined in 2003. That move was followed by the decision to move those schools to Eastern Maine. The KVAC also gained former Class A members of the Big East/Penobscot Valley Conference from the Bangor area in 2005 when that league was forced to disband due to loss of membership. 5 schools, Bangor High School, Brewer High School, Nokomis Regional High School, Old Town High School, and Hampden Academy, joined. Bangor, Brewer, and Hampden continue to be members of the Class A division, while Nokomis moved to Class B, and Old Town moved to Class B, but returned to the Big East/PVC. Erskine has jumped between Classes A and B since 2005 but will move back to B in 2013. Gardiner moved to Class B in 2007. Leavitt and Nokomis dropped to B in 2009, with Leavitt moving to the West. Morse dropped from EM Class A to WM Class B in 2011. Rockland District High School merged with nearby Georges Valley High School in 2011 to form Oceanside East/West High School. Oak Hill High School was a Class B member until 2012 when they moved to the Mountain Valley Conference, a Class B/C league in the western mountains. Erskine moved to Class B in 2013, and Maranacook to Class C. Spruce Mountain High School of Jay, a former member of the Mountain Valley Conference, joined the league for the 2014-15 school year.\n\nStarting with the 2015-16 season, basketball will be divided into five classes and into north and south regions.\n\nThe KVAC also holds an annual banquet in May to recognize 10 Senior Scholars from each of its member schools.\n\n==Cross-Country==\n===Class A Champions===\n====Women====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

He recorded the album in secrecy, mostly using basic home-recording equipment at his house in [[St John's Wood]]. Mixing and some later recording took place at professional studios in London. In its preference for loosely arranged performance, ''McCartney'' eschewed the polish of [[the Beatles]]' past records in favour of a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], he performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape.\n\nMcCartney recorded the album during a period of depression and confusion, following [[John Lennon]]'s private announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the Beatles. Conflicts over the release of McCartney's album further estranged him from his bandmates, as he refused to delay the album's release to allow for Apple's previously scheduled titles, notably the Beatles' album ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]''. A press release in the form of a self-interview, supplied with UK promotional copies of ''McCartney'', led to the announcement of [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]].\n\nOn release, the album received mostly negative reviews, while McCartney was vilified for seemingly ending the Beatles. The record was widely criticised for being under-produced and for its unfinished songs, although the ballad \"[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]\" was consistently singled out for praise. Commercially, ''McCartney'' benefited from the publicity surrounding the break-up; it held the number 1 position for three weeks on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] before yielding that position to ''Let It Be''. It peaked at number 2 in Britain. In 2011, the album was reissued with bonus tracks as part of the ''[[Paul McCartney Archive Collection]]''.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n\nFollowing [[John Lennon]]'s announcement in a band meeting on 20 September 1969 that he wanted a \"divorce\" from [[the Beatles]],<ref name=\"Doggett pp 101-03\">Doggett, pp. 101\u201303.</ref> [[Paul McCartney]] withdrew to his farm in [[Campbeltown]], Scotland.<ref name=\"Spizer p 116\">Spizer, p. 116.</ref> Author Robert Rodriguez describes his frame of mind as: \"brokenhearted, shocked, and dispirited at the loss of the only job he had ever known\".<ref name=\"Rodriguez p 1\" /> While the announcement was not made official, partly for business reasons,<ref name=\"Doggett pp 101-03\" /><ref>Woffinden, p. 27.</ref> McCartney's period in seclusion with his family coincided with widespread rumours in America that he had died<ref name=\"Sounes p 262\">Sounes, p. 262.</ref> \u2013 an escalation of the three-year-old [[Paul is dead|\"Paul Is Dead\"]] rumour.<ref>Schaffner, pp. 127\u201328.</ref><ref>Norman 2016, pp. 404\u201305.</ref> The rumour was dispelled by journalists from [[BBC Radio]]<ref>Miles 2001, pp. 357, 358.</ref> and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, who tracked him down at his farm, High Park.<ref>Sounes, pp. 262\u201363.</ref><ref>Norman 2016, pp. 405\u201306.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote= I nearly had a breakdown.

Had melodies like 'Momma Miss America' been teased out into compositions with a beginning, middle, end, and point, ''McCartney'' could have ended up as highly regarded in its own way as ''Plastic Ono Band'': a full slate of focused, listener-friendly pop confections that might very well have given fans far less cause for bitterness at the Beatles' breakup.\"<ref>Rodriguez, pp. 178\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Neil Young]] inducted McCartney into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]<ref>Badman, p. 619.</ref> and praised ''McCartney'', saying: \"I loved that record because it was so simple. And there was so much to see and to hear. It was just Paul. There was no adornment at all&nbsp;... There was no attempt made to compete with the things he had already done. And so out he stepped from the shadow of the Beatles.\"<ref name=\"WMMR\">{{cite web|author=Music News staff|url=http://www.wmmr.com/music/news/story.aspx?ID%3D1938551 |title=Flashback: Paul McCartney Releases First Solo Album|publisher=[[WMMR|wmmer.com]]|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=19 April 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404154744/http://www.wmmr.com/music/news/story.aspx?ID=1938551 |archivedate=4 April 2014}}</ref> McCartney subsequently told ''Rolling Stone'' that, given the album's homemade qualities, he considered it to be rock music's first [[Indie pop|indie]] album, adding: \"Y'know, it's now what would be called an 'indie' thing.

He recorded the album in secrecy, mostly using basic home-recording equipment at his house in [[St John's Wood]]. Mixing and some later recording took place at professional studios in London. In its preference for loosely arranged performance, ''McCartney'' eschewed the polish of [[the Beatles]]' past records in favour of a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], he performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape.\n\nMcCartney recorded the album during a period of depression and confusion, following [[John Lennon]]'s private announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the Beatles. Conflicts over the release of McCartney's album further estranged him from his bandmates, as he refused to delay the album's release to allow for Apple's previously scheduled titles, notably the Beatles' album ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]''. A press release in the form of a self-interview, supplied with UK promotional copies of ''McCartney'', led to the announcement of [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]].\n\nOn release, the album received mostly negative reviews, while McCartney was vilified for seemingly ending the Beatles. The record was widely criticised for being under-produced and for its unfinished songs, although the ballad \"[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]\" was consistently singled out for praise. Commercially, ''McCartney'' benefited from the publicity surrounding the break-up; it held the number 1 position for three weeks on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] before yielding that position to ''Let It Be''. It peaked at number 2 in Britain. In 2011, the album was reissued with bonus tracks as part of the ''[[Paul McCartney Archive Collection]]''.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n\nFollowing [[John Lennon]]'s announcement in a band meeting on 20 September 1969 that he wanted a \"divorce\" from [[the Beatles]],<ref name=\"Doggett pp 101-03\">Doggett, pp. 101\u201303.</ref> [[Paul McCartney]] withdrew to his farm in [[Campbeltown]], Scotland.<ref name=\"Spizer p 116\">Spizer, p. 116.</ref> Author Robert Rodriguez describes his frame of mind as: \"brokenhearted, shocked, and dispirited at the loss of the only job he had ever known\".<ref name=\"Rodriguez p 1\" /> While the announcement was not made official, partly for business reasons,<ref name=\"Doggett pp 101-03\" /><ref>Woffinden, p. 27.</ref> McCartney's period in seclusion with his family coincided with widespread rumours in America that he had died<ref name=\"Sounes p 262\">Sounes, p. 262.</ref> \u2013 an escalation of the three-year-old [[Paul is dead|\"Paul Is Dead\"]] rumour.<ref>Schaffner, pp. 127\u201328.</ref><ref>Norman 2016, pp. 404\u201305.</ref> The rumour was dispelled by journalists from [[BBC Radio]]<ref>Miles 2001, pp. 357, 358.</ref> and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, who tracked him down at his farm, High Park.<ref>Sounes, pp. 262\u201363.</ref><ref>Norman 2016, pp. 405\u201306.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote= I nearly had a breakdown.

''McCartney'' is \"a one-man-studio-band LP\" with \"a pronounced homemade quality; it was spare and sounded almost unfinished\".<ref>''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', p.

at the end of the recording.<ref name=\"Sounes p 264\" /> Reflected in the sequencing of the album, the second and third songs McCartney taped were \"[[That Would Be Something]]\", also written in Scotland, and the instrumental \"Valentine Day\".<ref name=\"Madinger & Easter p 155\">Madinger & Easter, p. 155.</ref> The latter was one of three selections on ''McCartney'' that its creator \"[[Ad

Although he notes that \"the throwaway nature of much of the material ... has become charming in retrospect\", Erlewine adds: \"Unfortunately, in retrospect it also appears as a harbinger of the nagging mediocrity that would plague McCartney's entire solo career.\"<ref name=\"AM\" /> ''[[Record Collector]]'' has highlighted \"Every Night\", \"Junk\" and \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" as songs that \"still sound absolutely effortless and demonstrate the man's natural genius with a melody\".<ref name=\"Record Collector\" />\n\nAmong Beatle biographers, Robert Rodriguez includes ''McCartney'' in his chapter covering the worst solo albums issued by the former band members between 1970 and 1980, saying: \"For anyone wanting to get to the root of the most common rap against Paul's solo output, look no further \u2026\"<ref>Rodriguez, p. 178.</ref> While bemoaning the lack of quality control that allowed \"charmless ditties\" such as \"Teddy Boy\" to go under-developed, Rodriguez writes: \"What made ''McCartney'' so frustrating a listen was not the absence of compelling musical ideas; it was the abundance of them. Had melodies like 'Momma Miss America' been teased out into compositions with a beginning, middle, end, and point, ''McCartney'' could have ended up as highly regarded in its own way as ''Plastic Ono Band'': a full slate of focused, listener-friendly pop confections that might very well have given fans far less cause for bitterness at the Beatles' breakup.\"<ref>Rodriguez, pp. 178\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Neil Young]] inducted McCartney into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]<ref>Badman, p. 619.</ref> and praised ''McCartney'', saying: \"I loved that record because it was so simple. And there was so much to see and to hear. It was just Paul. There was no adornment at all&nbsp;... There was no attempt made to compete with the things he had already done. And so out he stepped from the shadow of the Beatles.\"<ref name=\"WMMR\">{{cite web|author=Music News staff|url=http://www.wmmr.com/music/news/story.aspx?ID%3D1938551 |title=Flashback: Paul McCartney Releases First Solo Album|publisher=[[WMMR|wmmer.com]]|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=19 April 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404154744/http://www.wmmr.com/music/news/story.aspx?ID=1938551 |archivedate=4 April 2014}}</ref> McCartney subsequently told ''Rolling Stone'' that, given the album's homemade qualities, he considered it to be rock music's first [[Indie pop|indie]] album, adding: \"Y'know, it's now what would be called an 'indie' thing.

In each episode, a problem or difficulty is encountered.  They go to the Secret Museum, to [[time travel]] to the past, to observe, interact, and learn from the historical heroes.  They then return to the present, and use their experience to solve the problem.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interactive.wttw.com/playlist/2019/11/07/christopher-eliopoulos-xavier-riddle|title=A New PBS Show That Lets Kids Learn from the Example of Historical Heroes|date=2019-11-07|website=WTTW Chicago|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* Xavier Riddle (voiced by Aidan Vissers) \u2013 Xavier is the leader of his group with his sister Yadina and their friend Brad. He appears to be an excitable kid who is eager to go back in time and meet various historical figures. He is described as a kid who loves everything (especially art and basketball), but lives for adventures.\n* Yadina Riddle (voiced by Zoe Hatz) \u2013 Yadina is Xavier's sister. She seems to be eager to explore the secret museum and learn about various historical figures. She carries a stuffed turtle around with her named Dr. Zoom. She is quite talented, whether it be with books or with balls. Although Yadina is very extroverted (not a wallflower at all), she is only six years old. This means that she can be very honest with just about anyone, and sometimes even blunt. For example, Yadina dislikes meanness of any kind, and if anyone is not being friendly to another, Yadina will let them know exactly what she thinks of their behavior. When faced with conflict, Yadina is an expert at making others understand a situation from someone else's perspective, which ultimately requires empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation.\n* Brad Scott (voiced by Wyatt White) \u2013 Brad tends to be the most nervous and neurotic of his friends. He is sometimes hesitant to go on adventures. Brad is quite partial to butterflies, as well as action heroes. He is described as having \"delusions of averageness\", and is apprehensive over everything. His friends, Xavier and Yadina, encourage him to live a little and to try new things.\n\n===Major characters===\n* Berby \u2013 Berby is a time machine-like robot who lives at the Secret Museum. Berby helps Xavier, Yadina (and Dr. Zoom), and Brad travel back in time. Berby does not speak much, but makes robotic beeping sounds, and is good friends with the kids and Dr. Zoom.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode of ''Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum'' runs for half an hour. They consist of two 11-minute stories based on famous historical heroes around the world in the past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kveller.com/this-adorable-pbs-show-will-teach-your-kids-about-golda-meir/|title=This Adorable PBS Show Will Teach Your Kids About Golda Meir|date=2019-11-20|website=Kveller|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===Season 1 (2019\u2013present)===\n{{Episode table|overall=\n|background=#FF6666|season=|title=25|director=|writer=|airdate=|airdateR=|prodcode=|prodcodeR= {{refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|9 Story files the copyright for the episodes under groups, rather than separate episodes, as seen here:\n\n*{{cite web|url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Xavier+Riddle+and+the+Secret+Museum&Search_Code=TALL&PID=JzexIG-Tt_lYqtxWMIVtnT3Red-&SEQ=20200223224523&CNT=25&HIST=1|title=Public Catalog|publisher=United States Copyright Office|access-date=February 23, 2020}}}} |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum (season 1)\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=I Am [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]\"<hr />\"I Am [[Marie Curie]]\n|RTitle=\n|DirectedBy=Cory Bobiak\n|WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay|tlabel=Written by|t=Jennifer Daley|slabel=Storyboard by|tfirst=yes|s=Cory Bobiak}}<hr />{{StoryTeleplay|tlabel=Written by|t=Amy Brown|slabel=Storyboard by|tfirst=yes|s=Firas Momani}}\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2019|11|12}}\n|ProdCode=101\n|ShortSummary=<!-- Please do not copy episode summaries from other sources.

She questions if she can still be president, even though it is something no one has done before. The trio visit the Secret Museum, where a five-part star is shown to them. They travel to different periods in time, where they meet women who attempted to do something that has never been done before. Yadina learns how to do something that has never been done before by them, as she attempts to complete the star.\n\n== Production ==\nBrad Meltzer has been writing novels, nonfiction, television and comic books for over 50 years; his children\u2019s books were his favorite. He wrote the book ''Ordinary People Change the World'' and began a series based on the book named the Ordinary People series in 2014 with ''I Am Abraham Lincoln'', ''I Am Amelia Earhart'', ''I Am Rosa Parks'', and ''I Am Albert Einstein''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/arts/books/2019/11/08/brad-meltzers-kid-friendly-history-comes-to-pbs/|title=Brad Meltzer\u2019s kid-friendly history comes to PBS|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\nThe series is produced by 9 Story Media Group's animation division, [[Brown Bag Films]]. 9 Story's Chief Creative Officer [[Angela Santomero]] states that ''Xavier Riddle'' lets kids know they have \"the curiosity and adventurous spirit to change the world\". Meltzer added to that statement: \"When my own kids watch this series, I get to see them realize that there\u2019s extraordinary within the ordinary.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestreamable.com/news/xavier-riddle-and-the-secret-museum-streams-on-pbs-kids-platforms|title=\u2018Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum\u2019 Streams on PBS Kids Platforms|last=Siegel|first=Fern|website=The Streamable|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast ==\nThe series ran on [[TVOKids]] in Canada on December 10, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/xavierriddlehq?lang=en|title=Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum (@XavierRiddleHQ) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> And The Series Ran With [[Nat Geo Kids]] Latinoam\u00e9rica And [[Nick India]] On July 12 2020\n\n==Criticism and Reception==\nJoyce Slaton of [[Common Sense Media]] gave ''Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum'' a review. She stated that \"the show makes many historical inaccuracies, which makes it odd for a TV show that wants to make history come back alive for kids.\" She also stated that \"the show's tendency to play too fast and loose with the historical facts is confusing, and that 'Go for it!' is an unlikely motto for Amelia Earhart, who deceased in 1937 and didn't complete her solo Atlantic flight as a grade school student, as Xavier depicts.\" George Washington Carver did have a secret garden as a child, in which he learned important lessons that impacted his career in botany. But, as Slaton states, \"it's a real stretch to imagine him having to defend plants from renegade soccer players in 19th century Missouri,\" and that \"the show seems to overlook his importance as an activist for ex-slaves and champion of sustainable agriculture, instead boiling his messages down to 'take care of plants and you'll take care of the earth.'\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/xavier-riddle-and-the-secret-museum|title=Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum - TV Review|date=2019-11-19|website=www.commonsensemedia.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In each episode, a problem or difficulty is encountered.  They go to the Secret Museum, to [[time travel]] to the past, to observe, interact, and learn from the historical heroes.  They then return to the present, and use their experience to solve the problem.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://interactive.wttw.com/playlist/2019/11/07/christopher-eliopoulos-xavier-riddle|title=A New PBS Show That Lets Kids Learn from the Example of Historical Heroes|date=2019-11-07|website=WTTW Chicago|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n* Xavier Riddle (voiced by Aidan Vissers) \u2013 Xavier is the leader of his group with his sister Yadina and their friend Brad. He appears to be an excitable kid who is eager to go back in time and meet various historical figures. He is described as a kid who loves everything (especially art and basketball), but lives for adventures.\n* Yadina Riddle (voiced by Zoe Hatz) \u2013 Yadina is Xavier's sister. She seems to be eager to explore the secret museum and learn about various historical figures. She carries a stuffed turtle around with her named Dr. Zoom. She is quite talented, whether it be with books or with balls. Although Yadina is very extroverted (not a wallflower at all), she is only six years old. This means that she can be very honest with just about anyone, and sometimes even blunt. For example, Yadina dislikes meanness of any kind, and if anyone is not being friendly to another, Yadina will let them know exactly what she thinks of their behavior. When faced with conflict, Yadina is an expert at making others understand a situation from someone else's perspective, which ultimately requires empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation.\n* Brad Scott (voiced by Wyatt White) \u2013 Brad tends to be the most nervous and neurotic of his friends. He is sometimes hesitant to go on adventures. Brad is quite partial to butterflies, as well as action heroes. He is described as having \"delusions of averageness\", and is apprehensive over everything. His friends, Xavier and Yadina, encourage him to live a little and to try new things.\n\n===Major characters===\n* Berby \u2013 Berby is a time machine-like robot who lives at the Secret Museum. Berby helps Xavier, Yadina (and Dr.Zoom), and Brad travel back in time. Berby does not speak much, but makes robotic beeping sounds, and is good friends with the kids and Dr.Zoom.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode of ''Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum'' runs for half an hour. They consist of two 11-minute stories based on famous historical heroes around the world in the past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kveller.com/this-adorable-pbs-show-will-teach-your-kids-about-golda-meir/|title=This Adorable PBS Show Will Teach Your Kids About Golda Meir|date=2019-11-20|website=Kveller|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n===Season 1 (2019\u2013present)===\n{{Episode table|overall=\n|background=#FF6666|season=|title=25|director=|writer=|airdate=|airdateR=|prodcode=|prodcodeR= {{refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|9 Story files the copyright for the episodes under groups, rather than separate episodes, as seen here:\n\n*{{cite web|url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Xavier+Riddle+and+the+Secret+Museum&Search_Code=TALL&PID=JzexIG-Tt_lYqtxWMIVtnT3Red-&SEQ=20200223224523&CNT=25&HIST=1|title=Public Catalog|publisher=United States Copyright Office|access-date=February 23, 2020}}}} |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum (season 1)\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=I Am [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]\"<hr />\"I Am [[Marie Curie]]\n|RTitle=\n|DirectedBy=Cory Bobiak\n|WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay|tlabel=Written by|t=Jennifer Daley|slabel=Storyboard by|tfirst=yes|s=Cory Bobiak}}<hr />{{StoryTeleplay|tlabel=Written by|t=Amy Brown|slabel=Storyboard by|tfirst=yes|s=Firas Momani}}\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2019|11|12}}\n|ProdCode=101\n|ShortSummary=<!-- Please do not copy episode summaries from other sources.

She questions if she can still be president, even though it is something no one has done before. The trio visit the Secret Museum, where a five-part star is shown to them. They travel to different periods in time, where they meet women who attempted to do something that has never been done before. Yadina learns how to do something that has never been done before by them, as she attempts to complete the star.\n\n== Production ==\nBrad Meltzer has been writing novels, nonfiction, television and comic books for over 50 years; his children\u2019s books were his favorite. He wrote the book ''Ordinary People Change the World'' and began a series based on the book named the Ordinary People series in 2014 with ''I Am Abraham Lincoln'', ''I Am Amelia Earhart'', ''I Am Rosa Parks'', and ''I Am Albert Einstein''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/arts/books/2019/11/08/brad-meltzers-kid-friendly-history-comes-to-pbs/|title=Brad Meltzer\u2019s kid-friendly history comes to PBS|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\nThe series is produced by 9 Story Media Group's animation division, [[Brown Bag Films]]. 9 Story's Chief Creative Officer [[Angela Santomero]] states that ''Xavier Riddle'' lets kids know they have \"the curiosity and adventurous spirit to change the world\". Meltzer added to that statement: \"When my own kids watch this series, I get to see them realize that there\u2019s extraordinary within the ordinary.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestreamable.com/news/xavier-riddle-and-the-secret-museum-streams-on-pbs-kids-platforms|title=\u2018Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum\u2019 Streams on PBS Kids Platforms|last=Siegel|first=Fern|website=The Streamable|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcast ==\nThe series ran on [[TVOKids]] in Canada on December 10, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/xavierriddlehq?lang=en|title=Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum (@XavierRiddleHQ) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref> And The Series Ran With [[Nat Geo Kids]] Latinoam\u00e9rica And [[Nick India]] On July 12 2020\n\n==Criticism and Reception==\nJoyce Slaton of [[Common Sense Media]] gave ''Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum'' a review. She stated that \"the show makes many historical inaccuracies, which makes it odd for a TV show that wants to make history come back alive for kids.\" She also stated that \"the show's tendency to play too fast and loose with the historical facts is confusing, and that 'Go for it!' is an unlikely motto for Amelia Earhart, who deceased in 1937 and didn't complete her solo Atlantic flight as a grade school student, as Xavier depicts.\" George Washington Carver did have a secret garden as a child, in which he learned important lessons that impacted his career in botany.

The Rann is known for its marshy [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] which become snow white after the shallow water dries up each season before the [[monsoon]] rains.\n\nThe district is also known for [[ecology|ecologically]] important [[Banni grasslands]] with their seasonal [[marsh]]y [[wetland]]s which form the outer belt of the Rann of Kutch.\n\nKutch District is surrounded by the [[Gulf of Kutch]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] in south and west, while the northern and eastern parts are surrounded by the [[Great Rann of Kutch|Great]] and [[Little Rann of Kutch|Little Rann]] (seasonal wetlands) of Kutch. When there were not many dams built on its rivers, the Rann of Kutch remained wetlands for a large part of the year. Even today, the region remains wet for a significant part of year.

There are several sites related to the [[Indus valley civilization]] in the region, and it is mentioned in [[Hindu mythology]]. In historic times, Kutch is mentioned in Greek writings during [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. It was ruled by [[Menander I]] of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which was overthrown by [[Indo-Scythians]] followed by [[Maurya Empire]] and [[Indo-Parthians|Saka]]s. In the first century, it was under [[Western Satraps]] followed by [[Gupta Empire]]. By the fifth century, [[Maitraka]] of [[Valabhi]] took over from which its close association with the ruling clans of Gujarat started. [[Chavda dynasty|Chavdas]] ruled the eastern and central parts by seventh century but came under [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]]s by tenth century. After the fall of Chaulukya, [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]]s ruled the state. Following the conquest of Sindh by Muslim rulers, the [[Samma tribe|Rajput Samma]] started moving southwards to Kutch and ruled the western regions initially. By the tenth century, they controlled a significant area of Kutch, and by the thirteenth century they controlled the whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, [[Jadeja]].\n\nFor three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of the Jadeja brothers. In the sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao [[Khengarji I]] of these branches and his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had a good relationship with [[Gujarat Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II, left three sons, of whom two died, and a third son, [[Pragmal Ji]] took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of the seventeenth century. The descendants of the other brothers founded states in [[Kathiawar]]. After turbulent periods and battles with the armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of the eighteenth century by a council known as [[Bar Bhayat ni Jamat]] who placed Rao as a titular head and ruled independently. The state accepted the sovereignty of the [[British East India Company]] in 1819, when Kutch was defeated in battle. The state was devastated by an [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake|earthquake in 1819]]. The state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers.\n\nUpon the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Kutch acceded unto the [[dominion of India]] and was constituted an independent [[commissionaire]]. It was created a [[states and territories of India|state]] within the union of India in 1950. The state witnessed an [[1956 Anjar earthquake|earthquake in 1956]]. On 1 November 1956, [[Kutch State]] was merged with [[Bombay state]], which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]], with Kutch becoming part of [[Gujarat]] state as Kutch district. The district was affected by tropical cyclone in 1998 and the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in 2001]]. The state saw rapid industrialization and growth in tourism in subsequent years.\n\n== Geography ==\nKutch District, at {{Convert|45691.895|sqkm|sqmi}}, is the largest district in India. The administrative headquarters is in [[Bhuj]] which is geographically in the center of district. Other main towns are [[Gandhidham]], [[Rapar]], [[Nakhatrana]], [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], [[Mandvi]], [[Madhapar]], [[Mundra]] and Bhachau. Kutch has 969 villages. Kala Dungar (Black Hill) is the highest point in Kutch at {{Convert|458|m|ft|0}}.\n[[File:A state highway through the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|A state highway through the Rann of Kutch]]\nKutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west; the [[Gulf of Kutch]] in south and southeast and [[Rann of Kutch]] in north and northeast. The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the [[Sir Creek]]. The Kutch peninsula is an example of active [[Thrust fault|fold and thrust]] [[tectonism]]. In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized by [[Fault (geology)|fault propagation]] folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently dipping southern limbs. From the gradual increasing dimension of the linear chain of hillocks towards the west along the Kutch mainland [[Fault plane|fault]] and the [[epicentre]] of the earthquake of 2001 lying at the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault, it is suggested that the eastern part of the Kutch mainland fault is progressively emerging upward. It can be suggested from the absence of distinct [[surface rupture]] both during the [[1956 Anjar earthquake]] and [[2001 Bhuj earthquake]], that movements have taken place along a [[Blind thrust earthquake|blind thrust]]. Villages situated on the blind [[thrust]] in the eastern part of the Kutch mainland hill range (viz. Jawaharnagar, Khirsara, Devisar, Amarsar and Bandhdi) were completely erased during the 2001 earthquake.<ref name=\"karanth\">{{Cite journal |last1=Karanth |first1=R. V. |last2=Gadhavi |first2=M.

The script of the Kutchi language has become extinct. It is now mainly written in the Gujarati script. Samples of Kutch script are available in the [[Kutch Museum]]. The increased use of Gujarati language is mainly because of its being a medium of instruction in schools.\n\n=== People ===\n{{main|Kutchi people}}\n\nKutch district is inhabited by various groups and communities. One can find various nomadic, semi nomadic and artisan groups living in Kutch. [[Ahir]]s constitute a comparatively large group in Kutch.<ref>http://www.apnaorg.com/books/english/aboriginal-tribes/aboriginal-tribes.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Food and drink ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Dhamakedar Dabeli.jpg|thumb|left|Kutchi Dabeli]]\n[[File:Kutchi thali.JPG|thumb|Kutchi thali]]\n\nThe majority of the population is [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] and thus largely vegetarian. Jains also refrain from eating ''[[kandmool]]'' food grown below the ground such as [[potatoes]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[Amorphophallus paeoniifolius|yam]]. There are also a sizeable population of Muslims, who eat vegetables, chicken, mutton and occasionally camels.\n\nIn the villages, staple foods include kadi-khichdi, [[Pearl millet|bajra]] and milk ; bajara na rotla with curd and buttermilk is very common food for all the Gujarati people. Bajra was introduced by a king of this region named Lakho Fulani. During his period of exile, he came to know about this grain in some tribal regions. They also extensively drink [[buttermilk]] during lunch. Milk is considered to be sacred food and offering it to somebody is considered a gesture of friendship and welcoming. Settlement of dispute invariably follows offering milk to each other as a concluding remark. In the Kutchi engagement ceremony, the bride's family offers milk to the groom's relatives as a symbol of accepting their relationship.\n\n[[Tea]] is the most popular drink in this region.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Kandla Port.jpg|thumb|[[Kandla Port]]]]\nHistorically Kutch was always considered a backward region due to its location and submerged geography. The situation seemed to have worsened after the disastrous [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|Kutch earthquake]]. But in the next decade, the economy took an almost miraclous jumpstart due to the intense efforts of the Gujarat government. Kutch today is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India's fastest growing states \u2013 Gujarat. Its location on the far western edge of India has resulted in the commissioning of two major ports Kandla and Mundra. These ports are near most to the Gulf and Europe by the sea route. The hinterland of north-western India hosts more than 50% of India's population.\n\nQuality of roads is good in Kutch. The large part of the growth of Kutch came after intense development by the state government as part of 2001 earthquake relief.\n\nDue to the existence of two major ports i.e. [[Kandla Port|Kandla]] and [[Mundra Port|Mundra]] transportation as a business has thrived. Since historical times the people of Kutch have formed the backbone of trade between Gujarat mainland and Sindh. After the formation of Pakistan this trade stopped for good, but due to the inception of the Kandla port, trade boomed again. Kandla port is also in Kutch. It is considered Gateway to India's North. It is managed by the Kandla Port trust.\n\n=== Mineral ===\n[[File:Lignite-coal.jpg|thumb|[[Lignite]]]]\nKutch is a mineral rich region with a very large reserve of [[Lignite]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2006/stories/20030328007012200.htm|title=The brown gold of Kutch \u2013 By tapping the huge mineral deposits of the Kutch region, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. plans to turn the backward area into a prosperous one; SPECIAL FEATURE: GUJARAT; By V.K.

Adani Power expects to tie up funds for its 3300 MW plant by March 2012 and is on track to complete the installation of 10,000 MW projects by 2013.\n\n=== Forestry ===\nKutch district has a scanty forest cover. Hence there is negligible risk of illegal cutting of forests. This coupled with the adequate facilities available at Kandla port has helped establish the timber market. In 1987, \"Kandla Timber Association\" was formed in order to resolve the specific problems of timber importers and timber allied industries coming up during the period. The timber industry is growing at a faster pace with 300 saw mills working in Gandhidham-Kandla Complex.\n\n=== Salt ===\n[[File:Salt worker in Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|Salt worker in Rann of Kutch]]\nThe Little Rann of Kutch is known for its traditional salt production and various references mention this to be a 600-year-old activity. During the British period, this activity increased manifold. It was used to fund a substantial part of the military expenses of the British government.\n\nCommunities involved in salt production are mainly Chunvaliya Koli, Ahir and Miyana (Muslim), residing in 107 villages in the periphery of Lesser Rann of Kutch. These communities are traditionally known to have the skills of salt production and are known as 'Agariyas'. Water quality in 107 villages of Lesser Rann of Kutch is saline, thus agriculture is not an option. Hence salt production is the only livelihood option for Agariyas. As per the Salt Commission's report there are 45000 Agariyas working in the salt pans of Kutch. Out of the estimated total annual production of India of about 18&nbsp;million tonnes, Gujarat contributes 75% \u2013 mainly from Kutch and other parts of Saurashtra.\n\n=== Textile Art ===\n[[File:Antique Kutch Embroidery.jpg|thumb|right|An example of Kutch Embroidery \u2013 Antique Dowry Bag]]\n[[File:Ajrak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ajrak]]]]\nKutch is one of the most prolific regions in India in the area of textile art. Kutch embroidery is dense with motifs, and a variation with mirrors sewn into the embroidery is one of the signature arts of this region.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWithin the category of Kutch embroidery there are several sub-categories as each tribe and sub-tribe produces a unique signature form of art.\n\nKutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Kutch District\n| titlebar = #FCD116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Hindus|Hindu]]|orange|76.89}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims|Muslim]]|green|21.14}}\n{{bar percent|[[Jainism|Jain]]|pink|1.21}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.76}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br>\n{{small|Source: 2011 Census.}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Religion\n!Total\n!Percentage\n|-\n|[[Hinduism]]\n|1,608,921\n|76.89\n|-\n|[[Islam]]\n|442,355\n|21.14\n|-\n|[[Jainism]]\n|25,312\n|1.21\n|-\n|[[Sikhism]]\n|6,353\n|0.2\n|}\n\n*\n* A related Sarswat Brahmin are called Kutchi Sarswat Brahmin.

A set of village with fifteen Bhunga (traditional houses), a town square and a temple was created in Rann of Kutch near Kuran village where the film was shot.\n\nA song from upcoming movie [[Bhuj: The Pride of India]] was filmed in Kutch in late December 2019.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]]\n* [[Banni grasslands]]\n* [[Bhuj]]\n* [[Cutch State]]\n* [[Desalpur]]\n* [[Gandhidham]]\n* [[Harilal Upadhyay]]\n* [[Khavda]]\n* [[Kutch State]]\n* [[Kutchi (disambiguation)|Kutchi]]\n* [[Kutchi language]]\n* [[Kutchi people]]\n* [[Mandvi]]\n* [[Nakhatrana]]\n* [[Nani Aral]]\n* [[Princely State of Cutch]]\n* [[Rann of Kutch]]\n*[[Tharparkar]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikivoyage|Kutch}}\n{{commons category|Kutch district}}\n*[https://kutch.gujarat.gov.in Katch District Collectorate]\n*[https://kutchdp.gujarat.gov.in Katch District Panchayat]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162346/http://www.portal.gsi.gov.in/portal/page?_pageid=127,693641&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL of Kutch Peninsula and the Great Rann; The Geological Survey of India, Ministry of Mines, Government of India]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre = Kutch district\n|North = ''[[Badin District|Badin]] and [[Tharparkar District|Tharpakar]] districts, [[Sindh]]''\n|Northeast = [[Barmer district]], [[Rajasthan]] <br> [[Banaskantha district]]\n|East = [[Patan district]]\n|Southeast = [[Surendranagar district]] <br> [[Morbi district]]\n|South = ''[[Gulf of Kutch]]''\n|Southwest =''[[Arabian Sea]]''\n|West = ''[[Arabian Sea]]''\n|Northwest = ''[[Thatta District]], [[Sindh]]''}}\n\n{{Gujarat}}\n\n{{Coord|23.915|N|70.367|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Districts of Gujarat]]\n[[Category:Kutch district| ]]\n[[Category:Districts of India]]\n[[Category:Thar Desert]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{About|the modern district|the princely state|Cutch State|the former state from 1947 to 1956|Kutch State|the community in the United States|Kutch, Colorado}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = Kutch district\n| settlement_type        = [[Districts of Gujarat|District of Gujarat State]]\n| total_type             = Total\n| native_name            = \n| image_map              = Gujarat Kachchh district.png\n| map_caption            = Location of Kutch district in Gujarat\n| coordinates            = \n| coor_pinpoint          = Bhuj\n| subdivision_type       = Country\n| subdivision_name       = [[India]]\n| subdivision_type1      = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[Gujarat]]\n| subdivision_type2      = \n| subdivision_name2      = \n| established_title      = Established\n| established_date       = \n| seat_type              = Headquarters\n| seat                   = [[Bhuj]]\n| parts_type             = [[Tehsils of India|Tehsils]]\n| parts_style            = para\n| p1                     = 10\n| area_total_km2         = 45674\n| area_footnotes         = \n| population_as_of       = 2011\n| population_total       = 2,092,371\n| population_footnotes   = \n| population_urban       = \n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| demographics_type1     = Demographics\n| demographics1_title1   = [[Literacy in India|Literacy]]\n| demographics1_info1    = 70.59\n| demographics1_title2   = Sex ratio\n| demographics1_info2    = 908\n| leader_title           = \n| leader_name            = \n| leader_title1          = [[Lok Sabha|Lok Sabha constituencies]]\n| leader_name1           = [[Kachchh (Lok Sabha constituency)|Kutch]]\n| leader_title2          = [[Vidhan Sabha|Vidhan Sabha constituencies]]\n| leader_name2           = 6\n| timezone1              = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1            = +05:30\n| registration_plate     = \n| blank_name_sec1        = [[Indian road network|Major highways]]\n| blank_info_sec1        = 1\n| blank_name_sec2        = \n| blank_info_sec2        = \n| website                = https://kutch.gujarat.gov.in\n}}\n'''Kutch district''' ([[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: \u0a95\u0a9a\u0acd\u0a9b \u0a9c\u0abf\u0ab2\u0acd\u0ab2\u0acb; also spelled as '''Kachchh''') is a [[district]] of [[Gujarat]] state in western [[India]].

There are several sites related to the [[Indus valley civilization]] in the region, and it is mentioned in [[Hindu mythology]]. In historic times, Kutch is mentioned in Greek writings during [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. It was ruled by [[Menander I]] of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which was overthrown by [[Indo-Scythians]] followed by [[Maurya Empire]] and [[Indo-Parthians|Saka]]s. In the first century, it was under [[Western Satraps]] followed by [[Gupta Empire]]. By the fifth century, [[Maitraka]] of [[Valabhi]] took over from which its close association with the ruling clans of Gujarat started. [[Chavda dynasty|Chavdas]] ruled the eastern and central parts by seventh century but came under [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]]s by tenth century. After the fall of Chaulukya, [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]]s ruled the state. Following the conquest of Sindh by Muslim rulers, the [[Samma tribe|Rajput Samma]] started moving southwards to Kutch and ruled the western regions initially. By the tenth century, they controlled a significant area of Kutch, and by the thirteenth century they controlled the whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, [[Jadeja]].\n\nFor three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of the Jadeja brothers. In the sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao [[Khengarji I]] of these branches and his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had a good relationship with [[Gujarat Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II, left three sons, of whom two died, and a third son, [[Pragmal Ji]] took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of the seventeenth century. The descendants of the other brothers founded states in [[Kathiawar]]. After turbulent periods and battles with the armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of the eighteenth century by a council known as [[Bar Bhayat ni Jamat]] who placed Rao as a titular head and ruled independently. The state accepted the sovereignty of the [[British East India Company]] in 1819, when Kutch was defeated in battle. The state was devastated by an [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake|earthquake in 1819]]. The state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers.\n\nUpon the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Kutch acceded unto the [[dominion of India]] and was constituted an independent [[commissionaire]]. It was created a [[states and territories of India|state]] within the union of India in 1950. The state witnessed an [[1956 Anjar earthquake|earthquake in 1956]]. On 1 November 1956, [[Kutch State]] was merged with [[Bombay state]], which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]], with Kutch becoming part of [[Gujarat]] state as Kutch district. The district was affected by tropical cyclone in 1998 and the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in 2001]]. The state saw rapid industrialization and growth in tourism in subsequent years.\n\n== Geography ==\nKutch District, at {{Convert|45691.895|sqkm|sqmi}}, is the largest district in India. The administrative headquarters is in [[Bhuj]] which is geographically in the center of district. Other main towns are [[Gandhidham]], [[Rapar]], [[Nakhatrana]], [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], [[Mandvi]], [[Madhapar]], [[Mundra]] and Bhachau. Kutch has 969 villages. Kala Dungar (Black Hill) is the highest point in Kutch at {{Convert|458|m|ft|0}}.\n[[File:A state highway through the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|A state highway through the Rann of Kutch]]\nKutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west; the [[Gulf of Kutch]] in south and southeast and [[Rann of Kutch]] in north and northeast. The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the [[Sir Creek]]. The Kutch peninsula is an example of active [[Thrust fault|fold and thrust]] [[tectonism]]. In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized by [[Fault (geology)|fault propagation]] folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently dipping southern limbs. From the gradual increasing dimension of the linear chain of hillocks towards the west along the Kutch mainland [[Fault plane|fault]] and the [[epicentre]] of the earthquake of 2001 lying at the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault, it is suggested that the eastern part of the Kutch mainland fault is progressively emerging upward. It can be suggested from the absence of distinct [[surface rupture]] both during the [[1956 Anjar earthquake]] and [[2001 Bhuj earthquake]], that movements have taken place along a [[Blind thrust earthquake|blind thrust]]. Villages situated on the blind [[thrust]] in the eastern part of the Kutch mainland hill range (viz. Jawaharnagar, Khirsara, Devisar, Amarsar and Bandhdi) were completely erased during the 2001 earthquake.<ref name=\"karanth\">{{Cite journal |last1=Karanth |first1=R. V. |last2=Gadhavi |first2=M.

[[Ahir]]s constitute a comparatively large group in Kutch.<ref>http://www.apnaorg.com/books/english/aboriginal-tribes/aboriginal-tribes.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Food and drink ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Dhamakedar Dabeli.jpg|thumb|left|Kutchi Dabeli]]\n[[File:Kutchi thali.JPG|thumb|Kutchi thali]]\n\nThe majority of the population is [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] and thus largely vegetarian. Jains also refrain from eating ''[[kandmool]]'' food grown below the ground such as [[potatoes]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[Amorphophallus paeoniifolius|yam]]. There are also a sizeable population of Muslims, who eat vegetables, chicken, mutton and occasionally camels.\n\nIn the villages, staple foods include kadi-khichdi, [[Pearl millet|bajra]] and milk ; bajara na rotla with curd and buttermilk is very common food for all the Gujarati people. Bajra was introduced by a king of this region named Lakho Fulani. During his period of exile, he came to know about this grain in some tribal regions. They also extensively drink [[buttermilk]] during lunch. Milk is considered to be sacred food and offering it to somebody is considered a gesture of friendship and welcoming. Settlement of dispute invariably follows offering milk to each other as a concluding remark. In the Kutchi engagement ceremony, the bride's family offers milk to the groom's relatives as a symbol of accepting their relationship.\n\n[[Tea]] is the most popular drink in this region.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Kandla Port.jpg|thumb|[[Kandla Port]]]]\nHistorically Kutch was always considered a backward region due to its location and submerged geography. The situation seemed to have worsened after the disastrous [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|Kutch earthquake]]. But in the next decade, the economy took an almost miraclous jumpstart due to the intense efforts of the Gujarat government. Kutch today is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India's fastest growing states \u2013 Gujarat. Its location on the far western edge of India has resulted in the commissioning of two major ports Kandla and Mundra. These ports are near most to the Gulf and Europe by the sea route. The hinterland of north-western India hosts more than 50% of India's population.\n\nQuality of roads is good in Kutch. The large part of the growth of Kutch came after intense development by the state government as part of 2001 earthquake relief.\n\nDue to the existence of two major ports i.e. [[Kandla Port|Kandla]] and [[Mundra Port|Mundra]] transportation as a business has thrived. Since historical times the people of Kutch have formed the backbone of trade between Gujarat mainland and Sindh. After the formation of Pakistan this trade stopped for good, but due to the inception of the Kandla port, trade boomed again. Kandla port is also in Kutch. It is considered Gateway to India's North. It is managed by the Kandla Port trust.\n\n=== Mineral ===\n[[File:Lignite-coal.jpg|thumb|[[Lignite]]]]\nKutch is a mineral rich region with a very large reserve of [[Lignite]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2006/stories/20030328007012200.htm|title=The brown gold of Kutch \u2013 By tapping the huge mineral deposits of the Kutch region, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. plans to turn the backward area into a prosperous one; SPECIAL FEATURE: GUJARAT; By V.K.

Adani Power expects to tie up funds for its 3300 MW plant by March 2012 and is on track to complete the installation of 10,000 MW projects by 2013.\n\n=== Forestry ===\nKutch district has a scanty forest cover. Hence there is negligible risk of illegal cutting of forests. This coupled with the adequate facilities available at Kandla port has helped establish the timber market. In 1987, \"Kandla Timber Association\" was formed in order to resolve the specific problems of timber importers and timber allied industries coming up during the period. The timber industry is growing at a faster pace with 300 saw mills working in Gandhidham-Kandla Complex.\n\n=== Salt ===\n[[File:Salt worker in Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|Salt worker in Rann of Kutch]]\nThe Little Rann of Kutch is known for its traditional salt production and various references mention this to be a 600-year-old activity. During the British period, this activity increased manifold. It was used to fund a substantial part of the military expenses of the British government.\n\nCommunities involved in salt production are mainly Chunvaliya Koli, Ahir and Miyana (Muslim), residing in 107 villages in the periphery of Lesser Rann of Kutch. These communities are traditionally known to have the skills of salt production and are known as 'Agariyas'. Water quality in 107 villages of Lesser Rann of Kutch is saline, thus agriculture is not an option. Hence salt production is the only livelihood option for Agariyas. As per the Salt Commission's report there are 45000 Agariyas working in the salt pans of Kutch. Out of the estimated total annual production of India of about 18&nbsp;million tonnes, Gujarat contributes 75% \u2013 mainly from Kutch and other parts of Saurashtra.\n\n=== Textile Art ===\n[[File:Antique Kutch Embroidery.jpg|thumb|right|An example of Kutch Embroidery \u2013 Antique Dowry Bag]]\n[[File:Ajrak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ajrak]]]]\nKutch is one of the most prolific regions in India in the area of textile art. Kutch embroidery is dense with motifs, and a variation with mirrors sewn into the embroidery is one of the signature arts of this region.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWithin the category of Kutch embroidery there are several sub-categories as each tribe and sub-tribe produces a unique signature form of art.\n\nKutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Kutch District\n| titlebar = #FCD116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Hindus|Hindu]]|orange|76.89}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims|Muslim]]|green|21.14}}\n{{bar percent|[[Jainism|Jain]]|pink|1.21}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.76}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br>\n{{small|Source: 2011 Census.}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Religion\n!Total\n!Percentage\n|-\n|[[Hinduism]]\n|1,608,921\n|76.89\n|-\n|[[Islam]]\n|442,355\n|21.14\n|-\n|[[Jainism]]\n|25,312\n|1.21\n|-\n|[[Sikhism]]\n|6,353\n|0.2\n|}\n\n*\n* A related Sarswat Brahmin are called Kutchi Sarswat Brahmin.
