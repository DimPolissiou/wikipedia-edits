It has been amended numerous times over the years. It was originally found in [[Title 50 of the United States Code|Title 50]] of the U.S. Code (War) but is now found under Title 18, Crime. Specifically, it is {{Usc-title-chap|18|37}} ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|792}} et seq.)\n\nIt was intended to prohibit interference with [[military operation]]s or [[Military recruitment|recruitment]], to prevent insubordination in the military, and to prevent the support of United States enemies during wartime. In 1919, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously ruled through ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' that the act did not violate the [[freedom of speech]] of those convicted under its provisions. The [[constitutionality]] of the law, its relationship to free speech, and the meaning of its language have been contested in court ever since.\n\nAmong those charged with offenses under the Act are German-American socialist congressman and newspaper editor [[Victor L. Berger]], labor leader and five-time [[Socialist Party of America]] candidate, [[Eugene V.

It was based on the [[Defense Secrets Act of 1911]], especially the notions of obtaining or delivering information relating to \"national defense\" to a person who was not \"entitled to have it\", itself based on an earlier British [[Official Secrets Act]]. The Espionage Act law imposed much stiffer penalties than the 1911 law, including the death penalty.<ref name=eric1/>\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]], in his December 7, 1915 [[State of the Union]] address, asked Congress for the legislation:<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy''. 89</ref>\n{{quote|There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our Government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue&nbsp;...\n\nI urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation.

Even after the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Germany, when the Senate passed a version on February 20, 1917, the House did not vote before the then-current session of Congress ended.

The Supreme Court disagreed. The Espionage Act limits on free speech were ruled constitutional in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' (1919).<ref>{{ussc|name=Schenck v. United States|volume=249|page=47|pin=|year=1919}}.</ref> Schenck, an anti-war Socialist, had been convicted of violating the Act when he sent anti-draft pamphlets to men eligible for the draft. Although Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] joined the Court majority in upholding Schenck's conviction in 1919, he also introduced the theory that punishment in such cases must be limited to such political expression that constitutes a \"[[clear and present danger]]\" to the government action at issue. Holmes' opinion is the origin of the notion that speech equivalent to \"falsely [[shouting fire in a crowded theater]]\" is not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJustice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism from free speech advocates. He also met the Harvard Law professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] and discussed his criticism of ''Schenck''.<ref name=fenan/><ref>Chafee's treatise ''Free Speech in the United States'' included a lengthy attack on the ''Schenck'' decision.

The concept of [[bad tendency]] was used to justify the restriction of speech. The defendant was deported.

Associate Justice [[Frank Murphy]] noted in 1944 in ''Hartzel v. United States'' that \"For the first time during the course of the present war, we are confronted with a prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917.\" Hartzel, a World War I veteran, had distributed anti-war pamphlets to associations and business groups. The court's majority found that his materials, though comprising \"vicious and unreasoning attacks on one of our military allies, flagrant appeals to false and sinister racial theories, and gross libels of the President\", did not urge mutiny or any of the other specific actions detailed in the Act, and that he had targeted molders of public opinion, not members of the armed forces or potential military recruits. The court overturned his conviction in a 5\u20134 decision. The four dissenting justices declined to \"intrude on the historic function of the jury\" and would have upheld the conviction.<ref>U.S. Supreme Court Center: [http://supreme.justia.com/us/322/680/case.html ''Hartzel v.

These included the [[Venona project]] decryptions, the [[Elizabeth Bentley]] case, the [[atomic spies]] cases, the [[RDS-1|First Lightning]] Soviet nuclear test, and others. Many suspects were surveilled, but never prosecuted. These investigations were dropped, as can be seen in the [[FBI Silvermaster File]]s. There were also many successful prosecutions and convictions under the Act.\n\nIn August 1950, [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indicted under Title 50, sections 32a and 34, in connection with giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. [[Anatoli Yatskov|Anatoli Yakovlev]] was indicted as well. In 1951, [[Morton Sobell]] and [[David Greenglass]] were indicted.

Much of Title 50 (War and National Defense) was moved to [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] (Crimes and Criminal Procedure). Thus Title 50 Chapter 4, Espionage, (Sections 31\u201339), became Title 18, 794 and following. As a result, certain older cases, such as the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] case, are now listed under Title 50, while newer cases are often listed under Title 18.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=\"uscode.house.gov\"/>\n\n===1950 McCarran Internal Security Act===\nIn 1950, during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]], Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto. It modified a large body of law, including espionage law. One addition was {{USCSub2|18|793|e}}, which had almost exactly the same language as {{USCSub2|18|793|d}}. According to Edgar and Schmidt, the added section potentially removes the \"intent\" to harm or aid requirement and may make \"mere retention\" of information a crime no matter what the intent, covering even former government officials writing their memoirs. They also describe McCarran saying that this portion was intended directly to respond to the case of [[Alger Hiss]] and the \"[[Whittaker Chambers#\"Pumpkin Papers\"|Pumpkin Papers]]\".<ref name=edgsch/><ref name=ford_appeal1/><ref name=nyt_v_us1/>\n\n===Judicial review, 1960s and 1970s===\n\n====Brandenburg====\n{{Main|Brandenburg v. Ohio}}\nCourt decisions of this era changed the standard for enforcing some provisions of the Espionage Act. Though not a case involving charges under the Act, ''Brandenburg v. Ohio'' (1969) changed the \"clear and present danger\" test derived from ''Schenck'' to the \"[[imminent lawless action]]\" test, a considerably stricter test of the inflammatory nature of speech.<ref>{{ussc|name=Brandenburg v.

United States'' found that the government had not made a successful case for prior restraint of Free Speech, but a majority of the justices ruled that the government could still prosecute the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' for violating the Espionage Act in publishing the documents. Ellsberg and Russo were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act, but were freed due to a mistrial based on irregularities in the government's case.<ref>Correll, John T. \"[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx The Pentagon Papers]\" ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007.</ref>\n\nThe divided Supreme Court had denied the government's request to restrain the press. In their opinions the justices expressed varying degrees of support for the First Amendment claims of the press against the government's \"heavy burden of proof\" in establishing that the publisher \"has reason to believe\" the material published \"could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\".{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe case prompted Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to write an article on espionage law in the 1973 ''Columbia Law Review''. Their article was entitled \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\". Essentially they found the law to be poorly written and vague, with parts of it probably unconstitutional. Their article became widely cited in books and in future court arguments on Espionage cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/|title=Secrecy and Security Library|website=fas.org}}</ref>\n\n''United States v. Dedeyan'' in 1978 was the first prosecution under {{USCSub2|18|793|f|2}} (Dedeyan 'failed to report' that information had been disclosed). The courts relied on ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (1941) for precedent. The ruling touched on several constitutional questions including vagueness of the law and whether the information was \"related to national defense\". The defendant received a 3-year sentence.<ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/584/36/155427/ ''U.S. v Dedeyan''] 1978</ref><ref name=roswei1/>\n\nIn 1979\u201380, Truong Dinh Hung (aka [[David Truong]]) and [[Ronald Humphrey|Ronald Louis Humphrey]] were convicted under 793(a), (c), and (e) as well as several other laws. The ruling discussed several constitutional questions regarding espionage law, \"vagueness\", the difference between [[classified information]] and \"national defense information\", wiretapping and the Fourth Amendment. It also commented on the notion of bad faith ([[scienter]]) being a requirement for conviction even under 793(e); an \"honest mistake\" was said not to be a violation.<ref name=roswei1/><ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/629/908/266362/ U.S. v.

Morison told investigators that he sent classified satellite photographs to ''Jane's'' because the \"public should be aware of what was going on on the other side\", meaning that the Soviets' new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would transform the USSR's military capabilities. He said that \"if the American people knew what the Soviets were doing, they would increase the defense budget.\" British intelligence sources thought his motives were patriotic, but American prosecutors emphasized Morison's personal economic gain and complaints about his government job.<ref>''Time'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923689-3,00.html Alessandra Stanley, \"Spy vs. Spy Saga\", October 15, 1984], accessed March 11, 2011</ref>\n\nThe prosecution of Morison was used as part of a wider campaign against leaks of information as a \"test case\" for applying the Act to cover the disclosure of information to the press.

It has been amended numerous times over the years. It was originally found in [[Title 50 of the United States Code|Title 50]] of the U.S. Code (War) but is now found under Title 18, Crime. Specifically, it is {{Usc-title-chap|18|37}} ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|792}} et seq.)\n\nIt was intended to prohibit interference with [[military operation]]s or [[Military recruitment|recruitment]], to prevent insubordination in the military, and to prevent the support of United States enemies during wartime. In 1919, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously ruled through ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' that the act did not violate the [[freedom of speech]] of those convicted under its provisions. The [[constitutionality]] of the law, its relationship to free speech, and the meaning of its language have been contested in court ever since.\n\nAmong those charged with offenses under the Act are German-American socialist congressman and newspaper editor [[Victor L. Berger]], labor leader and five-time [[Socialist Party of America]] candidate, [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]] [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], former [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society]] president [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], communists [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' [[whistleblower]] [[Daniel Ellsberg]], [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Cablegate]] whistleblower [[Chelsea Manning]], [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] employee [[Henry Kyle Frese]], and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) contractor and whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]. Rutherford's conviction was overturned on appeal.<ref>Rogerson, Alan (1969), ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', Constable, London, {{ISBN|0-09-455940-6}}, full text at [https://archive.org/stream/MillionsNowLivingWillNeverDieRogerson/Millions_Now_Living_Rogerson_djvu.txt]</ref> Although the most controversial sections of the Act, a set of amendments commonly called the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], were repealed on March 3, 1921, the original Espionage Act was left intact.<ref>Vaughn, Stephen L. (ed.) (2007), ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism'', Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0415969506}}, p. 155.</ref>\n\n==Enactment==\nThe Espionage Act of 1917 was passed, along with the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]], just after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. It was based on the [[Defense Secrets Act of 1911]], especially the notions of obtaining or delivering information relating to \"national defense\" to a person who was not \"entitled to have it\", itself based on an earlier British [[Official Secrets Act]]. The Espionage Act law imposed much stiffer penalties than the 1911 law, including the death penalty.<ref name=eric1/>\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]], in his December 7, 1915 [[State of the Union]] address, asked Congress for the legislation:<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy''. 89</ref>\n{{quote|There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our Government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue&nbsp;...\n\nI urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are not many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power should close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality of the Government, they have sought to pry into every confidential transaction of the Government in order to serve interests alien to our own. It is possible to deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with.}}\n\nCongress moved slowly. Even after the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Germany, when the Senate passed a version on February 20, 1917, the House did not vote before the then-current session of Congress ended. After the declaration of war in April 1917, both houses debated versions of the Wilson administration's drafts that included press censorship.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 90\u201392</ref> That provision aroused opposition, with critics charging it established a system of \"[[prior restraint]]\" and delegated unlimited power to the president.<ref>Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr., \"The Espionage Statutes and the Publication of Defense Information\", ''Columbia Law Review''. v. 73. no. 5, May 1973, 950\u2013951</ref> After weeks of intermittent debate, the Senate removed the censorship provision by a one-vote margin, voting 39 to 38.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 92\u201395</ref> Wilson still insisted it was needed: \"Authority to exercise censorship over the press....is absolutely necessary to the public safety\", but signed the Act without the censorship provisions on June 15, 1917,<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 96</ref> after Congress passed the act on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|title=History.com: This Day in History \u2014 June 15, 1917: U.S. Congress passes Espionage Act|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-congress-passes-espionage-act|publisher=History.com|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313041013/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-congress-passes-espionage-act|archive-date=2013-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAttorney General [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] supported passage of the act, but viewed it as a compromise. The President's Congressional rivals were proposing to remove responsibility for monitoring pro-German activity, whether espionage or some form of disloyalty, from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and creating a form of courts-martial of doubtful constitutionality. The resulting Act was far more aggressive and restrictive than they wanted, but it silenced citizens opposed to the war.<ref name=Kennedy80>{{cite book |author=David M. Kennedy |author-link=David M.

This was punishable by death or by imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.\n* To convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies when the United States is at war, to cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or to willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States. This was punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or both.\n\nThe Act also gave the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] authority to impound or to refuse to mail publications that he determined to be in violation of its prohibitions.<ref>Ann Hagedorn, ''Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007), 29</ref>\n\nThe Act also forbids the transfer of any naval vessel equipped for combat to any nation engaged in a conflict in which the United States is neutral. Seemingly uncontroversial when the Act was passed, this later became a legal stumbling block for the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], when he sought to provide military aid to Great Britain before the United States entered [[World War II]].<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''FDR'' (New York: Random House, 2007), 467, 755n54</ref>\n\n===Amendments===\n{{main|Sedition Act of 1918}}\nThe law was extended on May 16, 1918, by the Sedition Act of 1918, actually a set of amendments to the Espionage Act, which prohibited many forms of speech, including \"any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States&nbsp;... or the flag of the United States, or the uniform of the Army or Navy\".<ref name=Kennedy80 />\n\nBecause the Sedition Act was an informal name, court cases were brought under the name of the Espionage Act, whether the charges were based on the provisions of the Espionage Act or the provisions of the amendments known informally as the Sedition Act.\n\nOn March 3, 1921, the Sedition Act amendments were repealed, but many provisions of the Espionage Act remain, codified under [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37.<ref>Cornell Law School: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37], accessed December 4, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1933, after signals intelligence expert [[Herbert Yardley]] published a popular book about breaking Japanese codes, the Act was amended to prohibit the disclosure of foreign code or anything sent in code.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 97; Herbert Yardley, ''The American Black Chamber'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1931)</ref> The Act was amended in 1940 to increase the penalties it imposed, and again in 1970.<ref>C.

He said the need for the Act to apply everywhere was prompted by [[Irvin C.

Most enforcement activity occurred in the Western states where the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] was active.<ref>Kennedy, ''Over Here'', 83</ref> Finally Gregory, a few weeks before the end of the war, instructed the U.S. Attorneys not to act without his approval.\n\nA year after the Act's passage, [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate in 1904, 1908, and 1912 was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for making a speech that \"obstructed recruiting\".

Burleson]] and those in his department played critical roles in the enforcement of the Act. He held his position because he was a Democratic party loyalist and close to both the President and the Attorney General. At a time when the Department of Justice numbered its investigators in the dozens, the Post Office had a nationwide network in place. The day after the Act became law, Burleson sent a secret memo to all postmasters ordering them to keep \"close watch on&nbsp;... matter which is calculated to interfere with the success of ... the government in conducting the war\".<ref>Christopher Cappozolla, ''Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 151\u2013152</ref> Postmasters in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Tampa, Florida]], refused to mail the ''Jeffersonian'', the mouthpiece of [[Thomas E.

Mitchell Palmer]], supported by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], then head of the Justice Department's Enemy Aliens Registration Section, prosecuted several hundred foreign-born known and suspected activists in the United States under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. This extended the Espionage Act to cover a broader range of offenses. After being convicted, persons including [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were deported to the Soviet Union on a ship the press called the \"[[USAT Buford|Soviet Ark]]\".<ref name=eric1/><ref name=gmu1/><ref name=fenan/>\n\n[[File:Freedom of speech in war times.djvu|right|thumb|150px|page=6|A version of Chafee's \"Free Speech in War Times\", the work that helped change Justice Holmes' mind]]\nMany of the jailed had appealed their convictions based on the U.S. constitutional right to the freedom of speech. The Supreme Court disagreed. The Espionage Act limits on free speech were ruled constitutional in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' (1919).<ref>{{ussc|name=Schenck v. United States|volume=249|page=47|pin=|year=1919}}.</ref> Schenck, an anti-war Socialist, had been convicted of violating the Act when he sent anti-draft pamphlets to men eligible for the draft. Although Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] joined the Court majority in upholding Schenck's conviction in 1919, he also introduced the theory that punishment in such cases must be limited to such political expression that constitutes a \"[[clear and present danger]]\" to the government action at issue. Holmes' opinion is the origin of the notion that speech equivalent to \"falsely [[shouting fire in a crowded theater]]\" is not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJustice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism from free speech advocates. He also met the Harvard Law professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] and discussed his criticism of ''Schenck''.<ref name=fenan/><ref>Chafee's treatise ''Free Speech in the United States'' included a lengthy attack on the ''Schenck'' decision. Zechariah Chafee, ''Free Speech in the United States'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace; 1920)</ref>\n\nLater in 1919, in ''Abrams v. United States'', the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a man who distributed circulars in opposition to American intervention in Russia following the [[Russian Revolution]]. The concept of [[bad tendency]] was used to justify the restriction of speech. The defendant was deported. Justices Holmes and Brandeis, however, dissented, with Holmes arguing that \"nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger that its opinions would hinder the success of the government arms or have any appreciable tendency to do so.\"<ref name=fenan/><ref>William E.

Associate Justice [[Frank Murphy]] noted in 1944 in ''Hartzel v. United States'' that \"For the first time during the course of the present war, we are confronted with a prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917.\" Hartzel, a World War I veteran, had distributed anti-war pamphlets to associations and business groups. The court's majority found that his materials, though comprising \"vicious and unreasoning attacks on one of our military allies, flagrant appeals to false and sinister racial theories, and gross libels of the President\", did not urge mutiny or any of the other specific actions detailed in the Act, and that he had targeted molders of public opinion, not members of the armed forces or potential military recruits. The court overturned his conviction in a 5\u20134 decision. The four dissenting justices declined to \"intrude on the historic function of the jury\" and would have upheld the conviction.<ref>U.S. Supreme Court Center: [http://supreme.justia.com/us/322/680/case.html ''Hartzel v.

United States''], accessed March 14, 2011</ref>\n\nThe Act was used in 1942 to deny a mailing permit to Father [[Charles Coughlin]]'s weekly ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', effectively ending its distribution to subscribers. It was part of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]]'s attempt to close down what he called \"vermin publications\". Coughlin had been criticized for virulently anti-Semitic writings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mails Barred to \"Social Justice\" |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19420415&id=SzsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2530,6670133|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |date=15 April 1942 |pages=1\u20132 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Stone |first=Goeffrey R. |year=2004 |title=Free Speech in World War II: When are you going to indict the seditionists? |journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=334\u2013367 |doi=10.1093/icon/2.2.334 }}</ref><ref name=\"timecom1942\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849845,00.html |title=The Press: Coughlin Quits |date=1942-05-18 |accessdate=2011-03-13 |journal=Time}}</ref>\n\nThe same year, a [[Japanese naval codes#1942 Chicago Tribune incident|June front-page story]] by [[Stanley Johnston]] in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', headlined \"Navy Had Word of Jap Plan to Strike at Sea\", implied that the Americans had broken the Japanese codes before the [[Battle of Midway]]. The story resulted in the Japanese changing their codebooks and callsign systems. The newspaper publishers were brought before a [[grand jury]] for possible indictment, but proceedings were halted because of government reluctance to present a jury with the highly secret information necessary to prosecute the publishers, as well as concern that a trial would attract more attention to the case.<ref name=comm1/><ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) | title = The Emperor's Codes: Bletchley Park and the breaking of Japan's secret ciphers | publisher = Bantam Press | date = 2000 | location = London | pages = 142, 143 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0593-046412 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, six associates of ''[[Amerasia]]'' magazine, a journal of Far Eastern affairs, came under suspicion after publishing articles that bore similarity to [[Office of Strategic Services]] reports. The government proposed using the Espionage Act against them but later softened its approach, changing the charges to Embezzlement of Government Property (now {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|641}}). A grand jury cleared three of the associates, two associates paid small fines, and charges against the sixth man were dropped. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] said the failure to aggressively prosecute the defendants was a communist conspiracy. According to Kleht and Radosh, the case helped build his later notoriety.<ref name=amerasia/>\n\n===Mid-20th century Soviet spies===\nNavy employee Hafis Salich sold Soviet agent Mihail Gorin information regarding Japanese activities in the late 1930s. ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (1941) was cited in many later espionage cases for its discussion of the charge of \"vagueness\", an argument made against the terminology used in certain portions of the law, such as what constitutes \"national defense\" information.\n\nLater in the 1940s, several incidents prompted the government to increase its investigations into Soviet espionage. These included the [[Venona project]] decryptions, the [[Elizabeth Bentley]] case, the [[atomic spies]] cases, the [[RDS-1|First Lightning]] Soviet nuclear test, and others. Many suspects were surveilled, but never prosecuted. These investigations were dropped, as can be seen in the [[FBI Silvermaster File]]s. There were also many successful prosecutions and convictions under the Act.\n\nIn August 1950, [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indicted under Title 50, sections 32a and 34, in connection with giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. [[Anatoli Yatskov|Anatoli Yakovlev]] was indicted as well. In 1951, [[Morton Sobell]] and [[David Greenglass]] were indicted. After a controversial trial in 1951, the Rosenbergs were sentenced to death. They were executed in 1953, making their two sons orphans. The boys were adopted by another family.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=fbirosenberg/><ref name=eyespy_rosenb/> In the late 1950s, several members of the [[Soviet espionage in the United States#Soble spy ring|Soble spy ring]], including [[Robert Soblen]], and [[Jack Soble|Jack]] and [[Myra Soble]], were prosecuted for espionage. In the mid-1960s, the act was used against James Mintkenbaugh and [[Robert Lee Johnson (spy)|Robert Lee Johnson]], who sold information to the Soviets while working for the U.S. Army in Berlin.<ref name=\"time.com1962\"/><ref name=\"time.com1965\"/>\n\n===1948 code revision===\nIn 1948, some portions of the [[United States Code]] were reorganized. Much of Title 50 (War and National Defense) was moved to [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] (Crimes and Criminal Procedure). Thus Title 50 Chapter 4, Espionage, (Sections 31\u201339), became Title 18, 794 and following. As a result, certain older cases, such as the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] case, are now listed under Title 50, while newer cases are often listed under Title 18.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=\"uscode.house.gov\"/>\n\n===1950 McCarran Internal Security Act===\nIn 1950, during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]], Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto. It modified a large body of law, including espionage law. One addition was {{USCSub2|18|793|e}}, which had almost exactly the same language as {{USCSub2|18|793|d}}. According to Edgar and Schmidt, the added section potentially removes the \"intent\" to harm or aid requirement and may make \"mere retention\" of information a crime no matter what the intent, covering even former government officials writing their memoirs. They also describe McCarran saying that this portion was intended directly to respond to the case of [[Alger Hiss]] and the \"[[Whittaker Chambers#\"Pumpkin Papers\"|Pumpkin Papers]]\".<ref name=edgsch/><ref name=ford_appeal1/><ref name=nyt_v_us1/>\n\n===Judicial review, 1960s and 1970s===\n\n====Brandenburg====\n{{Main|Brandenburg v. Ohio}}\nCourt decisions of this era changed the standard for enforcing some provisions of the Espionage Act. Though not a case involving charges under the Act, ''Brandenburg v. Ohio'' (1969) changed the \"clear and present danger\" test derived from ''Schenck'' to the \"[[imminent lawless action]]\" test, a considerably stricter test of the inflammatory nature of speech.<ref>{{ussc|name=Brandenburg v.

United States'' found that the government had not made a successful case for prior restraint of Free Speech, but a majority of the justices ruled that the government could still prosecute the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' for violating the Espionage Act in publishing the documents. Ellsberg and Russo were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act, but were freed due to a mistrial based on irregularities in the government's case.<ref>Correll, John T. \"[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx The Pentagon Papers]\" ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007.</ref>\n\nThe divided Supreme Court had denied the government's request to restrain the press. In their opinions the justices expressed varying degrees of support for the First Amendment claims of the press against the government's \"heavy burden of proof\" in establishing that the publisher \"has reason to believe\" the material published \"could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\".{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe case prompted Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to write an article on espionage law in the 1973 ''Columbia Law Review''. Their article was entitled \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\". Essentially they found the law to be poorly written and vague, with parts of it probably unconstitutional. Their article became widely cited in books and in future court arguments on Espionage cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/|title=Secrecy and Security Library|website=fas.org}}</ref>\n\n''United States v. Dedeyan'' in 1978 was the first prosecution under {{USCSub2|18|793|f|2}} (Dedeyan 'failed to report' that information had been disclosed). The courts relied on ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (1941) for precedent. The ruling touched on several constitutional questions including vagueness of the law and whether the information was \"related to national defense\". The defendant received a 3-year sentence.<ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/584/36/155427/ ''U.S. v Dedeyan''] 1978</ref><ref name=roswei1/>\n\nIn 1979\u201380, Truong Dinh Hung (aka [[David Truong]]) and [[Ronald Humphrey|Ronald Louis Humphrey]] were convicted under 793(a), (c), and (e) as well as several other laws. The ruling discussed several constitutional questions regarding espionage law, \"vagueness\", the difference between [[classified information]] and \"national defense information\", wiretapping and the Fourth Amendment. It also commented on the notion of bad faith ([[scienter]]) being a requirement for conviction even under 793(e); an \"honest mistake\" was said not to be a violation.<ref name=roswei1/><ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/629/908/266362/ U.S. v.

A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bulldogs represent [[California State University, Fresno]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Mountain West Conference]] (MW).\n\nFresno State began competing in intercollegiate football in 1921,<ref name=\"MG\" /> but these lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:\n* Since 1979, seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.\n* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.\n* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate = 2016-08-20|website = ESPN.com|publisher = AP|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160601212457/http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html#|archive-date = 2016-06-01|url-status = live}}</ref> The Bulldogs have played in 11 bowl games since this decision, giving many recent players an extra game to accumulate statistics.\n* Similarly, the Bulldogs have appeared in the [[Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game]] twice since it began in 2013.\n* Additionally, Fresno State has been grouped in the same MW football division as [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii]] since divisional play began in 2013, meaning that it plays at Hawaii every other year (currently in even-numbered years). This is relevant because the NCAA allows teams that play at Hawaii in a given season to schedule 13 regular-season games instead of the normal 12. The Bulldogs have played a 13-game regular season once since divisional play began, in 2014. \n\nThese lists are updated through the end of the [[2016 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|2016
