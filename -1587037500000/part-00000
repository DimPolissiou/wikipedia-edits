A popular design is the \"oatmeal box\", a vertical cylindrical container in which the pinhole is made in one side and the film or photographic paper is wrapped around the inside wall opposite, and extending almost right to the edge of, the pinhole.

Such stitched images may even be fashioned into forms of [[virtual reality]] movies, using technologies such as [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[QuickTime VR]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Java 3D|Java]], or even [[JavaScript]]. A [[rotating line camera]] such as the [[Panoscan]] allows the capture of high resolution panoramic images and eliminates the need for [[image stitching]], but immersive \"spherical\" panorama movies (that incorporate a full 180\u00b0 vertical viewing angle as well as 360\u00b0 around) must be made by stitching multiple images. Stitching images together can be used to create extremely high resolution [[gigapixel]] panoramic images.\n\n{{wide image|ALMA_Panoramic_View_with_Carina_Nebula.jpg|600px|Panoramic view of the antennas of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] under the clear sky over the Chajnantor Plateau, in the Chilean Andes.<ref>{{cite news|title=ALMA Panoramic View with Carina Nebula|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1345a/|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}</ref> }}\n\n== Motion picture ==\n{{see also|Immersive video}}\nOn rare occasions, 360\u00b0 panoramic movies have been constructed for specially designed display spaces\u2014typically at [[theme park]]s, [[world's fair]]s, and museums.

Precisely overlapping slides placed in slide mounts with soft-edge density masks would merge seamlessly on the screen to create the panorama. Cutting and dissolving between sequential images generated animation effects in the panorama format.\n\n{{wide image|In-camera_panorama_stitch.jpg|600px|A 270 degree panorama stitched \"in-camera\".

Such stitched images may even be fashioned into forms of [[virtual reality]] movies, using technologies such as [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[QuickTime VR]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Java 3D|Java]], or even [[JavaScript]]. A [[rotating line camera]] such as the [[Panoscan]] allows the capture of high resolution panoramic images and eliminates the need for [[image stitching]], but immersive \"spherical\" panorama movies (that incorporate a full 180\u00b0 vertical viewing angle as well as 360\u00b0 around) must be made by stitching multiple images. Stitching images together can be used to create extremely high resolution [[gigapixel]] panoramic images.\n\n{{wide image|ALMA_Panoramic_View_with_Carina_Nebula.jpg|600px|Panoramic view of the antennas of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] under the clear sky over the Chajnantor Plateau, in the Chilean Andes.<ref>{{cite news|title=ALMA Panoramic View with Carina Nebula|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1345a/|accessdate=12 November 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}</ref> }}\n\n== Motion picture ==\n{{see also|Immersive video}}\nOn rare occasions, 360\u00b0 panoramic movies have been constructed for specially designed display spaces\u2014typically at [[theme park]]s, [[world's fair]]s, and museums.

Panoramic systems that are less than 360\u00b0 around also exist.

According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. Moreover, the surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area.

The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan, the beys and the local [[sipahi]]s that were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from Kelmendi to modern [[Sandzak]]. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace theirs origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

So that proportion is completely out of kilter and we desperately need to do something about it. Part of the problem is that it is edited by volunteers but there are about 350,000 \"uber\" volunteers that tend, no offence to them, to be the same kind of guy who has the time to sit and do it and doesn't have laundry to do and are actively editing women out.

Part of the problem is that it is edited by volunteers but there are about 350,000 \"uber\" volunteers that tend, no offence to them, to be the same kind of guy who has the time to sit and do it and doesn't have laundry to do and are actively editing women out.

The original musical score was composed by [[Pino Donaggio]].\n\nThe film was a direct homage to the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], specifically ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954) taking plot lines and themes (such as [[voyeurism]] and obsession) from the first two films.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams |first=Linda |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6pL0AUb5BHUC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema|page=86|year=2005|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ann |last=Cvetkovich |chapter-url=http://english.illinoisstate.edu/strickland/rsvtxt/cvetko.htm |chapter=Postmodern Vertigo: The Sexual Politics of Allusion in De Palma's Body Double |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211060858/http://english.illinoisstate.edu/strickland/rsvtxt/cvetko.htm |archivedate=February 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |editor-last1=Raubicheck |editor-first1=Walter |editor-first2=Walter |editor-last2=Srebnick |title=Hitchcock's Rereleased Films: From Rope to Vertigo |location=Detroit |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nThe film received a lukewarm result at the box office and mixed reviews, but has subsequently become a [[cult film]]. When [[Twilight Time (DVD label)|Twilight Time]] released the film on Blu-ray in the United States in 2013, it quickly sold out.<ref>https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/61564/body-double-blu-ray/</ref><ref>http://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/body-double-blu-ray-review.325785/</ref><ref>http://www.rupertpupkinspeaks.com/2013/08/twilight-timey-body-double-on-blu-ray.html</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJake Scully ([[Craig Wasson]]) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a [[vampire]] in a low-budget [[horror film]] after his [[claustrophobia]] thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend ([[Barbara Crampton]]) cheating on him, he splits and is left without a place to stay (the residence belongs to her). At a [[method acting]] class, he meets Sam Bouchard ([[Gregg Henry]]) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's rich friend has gone on a trip to Europe and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the [[Hollywood Hills]].\n\nDuring the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially enthusiastic about showing Scully one feature: a [[telescope]], and through it a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle ([[Deborah Shelton]]), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Scully voyeuristically watches Gloria each night until he sees her being abused by a man she appears to know. The next day he follows her when she goes shopping. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \"Indian\", a man he had noticed was watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside [[motel]] where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully pursues him into a nearby tunnel but is overcome by his claustrophobia. Gloria walks him out of it. They impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns and breaks into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld [[drill]].\n\n[[File:John Lautner's Chemosphere (8189866290).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chemosphere]], the ultramodern house used in ''Body Double'']]\nScully alerts the police, who determine it was a botched robbery. However, Detective McLean ([[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]]) becomes suspicious after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in Scully's pocket. Although McLean does not arrest him, he tells Scully that his voyeuristic behavior, as well as not alerting the police sooner, helped cause Gloria's murder. Unable to sleep, Scully watches a pornography TV channel. He observes that the actress, Holly Body ([[Melanie Griffith]]), dances in exactly the same sensual manner that Gloria did. To meet Holly, he pretends to be a porn producer hiring for a new film.\n\nScully learns from Holly that Sam hired her to impersonate Gloria each night, dancing in the window, knowing Scully would be watching and later witness the real Gloria's murder. Offended at the suggestion she was involved in a killing, Holly storms out of the house. She is picked up by the Indian who knocks her unconscious and drives her away. Scully follows them to an aqueduct where the Indian is digging a grave. During their fight, Scully discovers the Indian is Sam in heavy make-up. Scully was a scapegoat providing Sam, who was Gloria's abusive husband, with an alibi during the murder. Scully is overpowered and thrown into the grave and is incapacitated by his claustrophobia. However, he overcomes his fear and climbs out as Sam is knocked into the aqueduct and drowned.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Scully is shown having been recast in his previous vampire role as Holly watches from the sidelines.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Craig Wasson]] as Jake Scully\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Sam Bouchard\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Holly Body\n* [[Deborah Shelton]] as Gloria Revelle\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Detective Jim McLean\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Rubin\n* [[David Haskell]] as Will\n* [[Al Israel]] as Corso\n* [[Douglas Warhit]] as Video Salesman\n* B.J.

He says he got it when interviewing [[Angie Dickinson]]'s body doubles for ''Dressed to Kill''.<ref name=\"de\"/> \" I started thinking about the whole idea of the body double,\" he said. \"I wondered what I would do if I wanted to make sure to get somebody's attention, to have them looking at a certain place at a certain time.\"<ref name=\"define\">DE PALMA: A DEFINITION OF SUSPENSE\nLyman, Rick.

It has a voyeuristic theme, about people being sucked into the things they're watching. A wild, erotic roller-coaster ride, so many twists and turns. I've watched audiences jump before, or seen them sit bolt upright in their seats. But I can't wait to watch an audience when they see this movie. They've never seen anything like this before.\"<ref name=\"de\"/>\n\nDe Palma had admired a script written by Robert Avrech and hired Avrech to write the script.

After returning home to discover his girlfriend ([[Barbara Crampton]]) cheating on him, he splits and is left without a place to stay (the residence belongs to her). At a [[method acting]] class, he meets Sam Bouchard ([[Gregg Henry]]) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's rich friend has gone on a trip to Europe and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the [[Hollywood Hills]].\n\nDuring the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially enthusiastic about showing Scully one feature: a [[telescope]], and through it a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle ([[Deborah Shelton]]), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Scully voyeuristically watches Gloria each night until he sees her being abused by a man she appears to know. The next day he follows her when she goes shopping. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \"Indian\", a man he had noticed was watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside [[motel]] where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully pursues him into a nearby tunnel but is overcome by his claustrophobia. Gloria walks him out of it. They impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns and breaks into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld [[drill]].\n\n[[File:John Lautner's Chemosphere (8189866290).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chemosphere]], the ultramodern house used in ''Body Double'']]\nScully alerts the police, who determine it was a botched robbery. However, Detective McLean ([[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]]) becomes suspicious after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in Scully's pocket. Although McLean does not arrest him, he tells Scully that his voyeuristic behavior, as well as not alerting the police sooner, helped cause Gloria's murder. Unable to sleep, Scully watches a pornography TV channel. He observes that the actress, Holly Body ([[Melanie Griffith]]), dances in exactly the same sensual manner that Gloria did. To meet Holly, he pretends to be a porn producer hiring for a new film.\n\nScully learns from Holly that Sam hired her to impersonate Gloria each night, dancing in the window, knowing Scully would be watching and later witness the real Gloria's murder. Offended at the suggestion she was involved in a killing, Holly storms out of the house. She is picked up by the Indian who knocks her unconscious and drives her away. Scully follows them to an aqueduct where the Indian is digging a grave. During their fight, Scully discovers the Indian is Sam in heavy make-up. Scully was a scapegoat providing Sam, who was Gloria's abusive husband, with an alibi during the murder. Scully is overpowered and thrown into the grave and is incapacitated by his claustrophobia. However, he overcomes his fear and climbs out as Sam is knocked into the aqueduct and drowned.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Scully is shown having been recast in his previous vampire role as Holly watches from the sidelines.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Craig Wasson]] as Jake Scully\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Sam Bouchard\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Holly Body\n* [[Deborah Shelton]] as Gloria Revelle\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Detective Jim McLean\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Rubin\n* [[David Haskell]] as Will\n* [[Al Israel]] as Corso\n* [[Douglas Warhit]] as Video Salesman\n* B.J.

The tournament was hosted by [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. [[ABS-CBN]] covered the games on [[Studio 23]].\n\nAfter a UAAP Board decision that upheld the [[UE Red Warriors]]' protest against the [[De La Salle Green Archers]], three teams ended tied for first after the elimination round. By virtue of having the superior point differential from games among the tied teams, the defending champions [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]] secured the #1 seed; the [[FEU Tamaraws]] defeated UE in the second-seed playoff in a virtual game one of a best-of-3 series. Ateneo needed their twice-to-beat advantage to outlast La Salle in a fight-marred series to advance to the Finals, while FEU needed one game to eliminate a stubborn UE team. In the Finals, FEU coach Koy Banal led the team to victory over a tired Ateneo team coached by his brother Joel to win FEU's first UAAP men's basketball championship since 1997.\n\nUE's [[James Yap]] was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the season. [[Arwind Santos]] was named Finals MVP.\n\n==Elimination round==\n<section begin=\"Men's standings\" />{{UAAPteam standings |source=[https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap ABS-CBN Sports]\n|tm1 = Ateneo   |tm1-w = 11|tm1-l = 3 |bg1=2X |hth1=Head-to-head goal averages: Ateneo +21, UE \u20135, FEU \u201316; second-seed playoff: FEU 80\u201375 UE\n|tm2 = FEU      |tm2-w = 11|tm2-l = 3 |bg2=2X |hth2=TEAM1 |status2=host\n|tm3 = UE       |tm3-w = 11|tm3-l = 3 |bg3=SF |hth3=TEAM1\n|tm4 = La Salle |tm4-w = 7 |tm4-l = 7 |bg4=SF\n|tm5 = Adamson  |tm5-w = 5 |tm5-l = 9 |hth5=Overall point differential: Adamson &minus;59, UST &minus;62\n|tm6 = UST      |tm6-w = 5 |tm6-l = 9 |hth6=TEAM5\n|tm7 = UP       |tm7-w = 3 |tm7-l = 11\n|tm8 = NU       |tm8-w = 1 |tm8-l = 13\n}}<section end=\"Men's standings\" />\n\nUE put the result of their 65\u201364 second round game loss against La Salle under protest as UE contended that [[Junjun Cabatu]]'s last-second three-point [[buzzer beater]] for La Salle was made after the end-game buzzer sounded.

In 1907, she opened her first classroom, the Casa dei Bambini, or Children's House, in a tenement building in Rome.<ref name=Kramer/>{{rp|112}} From the beginning, Montessori based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as \"[[Maria Montessori#Scientific pedagogy|scientific pedagogy]]\".\n\nIn 1901, Maria Montessori met Alice and [[Leopoldo Franchetti]] (Baroness & Baron) of [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]]. They found many matching points between their work. Maria Montessori was invited to hold her first course for teachers and to set up a \"Casa dei Bambini\" at Villa Montesca, the home of the Franchettis in Citt\u00e0 di Castello. Maria Montessori decided to move to Citt\u00e0 di Castello, where she lived for two years and where she refined her methodology together with Alice Franchetti. In that period, she published her book in Citt\u00e0 di Castello. The Franchetti Barons financed the publication of the book, and the methodology had the name \"Method Franchetti-Montessori\". Alice Franchetti died in 1911 at the age of 37 years old.\n\nMontessori education had spread to the United States by 1912 and became widely known in educational and popular publications. As well, in 1913 [[Narcissa Cox Vanderlip]] and [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] founded the [[Scarborough School]], the first Montessori school in the U.S.<ref name=\"Narcissa\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/vanderlip-narcissa.cfm |title=Narcissa Cox Vanderlip (1879\u20131966) |publisher=.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-12-31}}</ref><ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|last=Cheever|first=Mary|title=The Changing Landscape: A History of Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough|year=1990|publisher=Phoenix Publishing|location=West Kennebunk, Maine|isbn=978-0-914659-49-5|oclc=22274920}}</ref> However, conflict arose between Montessori and the American educational establishment. The 1914 critical booklet ''The Montessori System Examined'', by influential education teacher [[William Heard Kilpatrick]], limited the spread of Montessori's ideas, and they languished after 1914. Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12.\n\nMontessori education also spread throughout the world, including Southeast Asia and [[India]], where Maria Montessori [[Montessori in India|was interned during World War II]].\n\n==Montessori education theory==\n[[File:Montessori Classroom.jpg|thumb|A Montessori classroom in the United States.]]\nMontessori education is fundamentally a model of [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and an educational approach based on that model. The model has two basic principles. First, children and developing adults engage in psychological self-construction by means of interaction with their environments. Second, children, especially under the age of six, have an innate path of psychological development. Based on her observations, Montessori believed that children who are at liberty to choose and act freely within an environment prepared according to her model would act spontaneously for optimal development.\n\nMontessori saw universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as \"human tendencies\" in 1957. There is some debate about the exact list, but the following are clearly identified:<ref>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Mario|title=The Human Tendencies and Montessori Education|year=1966|publisher=Association Montessori Internationale|location=Amsterdam|url=http://amiusa.org/shop/the-human-tendencies-and-montessori-education|access-date=2011-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162508/http://amiusa.org/shop/the-human-tendencies-and-montessori-education|archive-date=2012-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=26em|\n* [[Abstraction#Abstraction in psychology|Abstraction]]\n* Activity\n* Communication\n* Exactness\n* Exploration\n* Manipulation (of the environment)\n* Order\n* Orientation\n* Repetition\n* Self-Perfection\n* Work (also described as \"purposeful activity\")\n}}\n\nIn the Montessori approach, these human tendencies are seen as driving behaviour in every stage of development, and education should respond to and facilitate their expression.\n\nMontessori education involves free activity within a \"prepared environment\", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child.<ref name=\"Lillard2011\">{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}</ref> The function of the environment is to help and allow the child to develop independence in all areas according to his or her inner psychological directives. In addition to offering access to the Montessori materials appropriate to the age of the children, the environment should exhibit the following characteristics:<ref name=Standing>{{cite book|last=Standing|first=E. M.|title=Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work|year=1957|publisher=Plume|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|263\u2013280}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=28em|\n* An arrangement that facilitates movement and activity\n* Beauty and harmony, cleanliness of environment\n* Construction in proportion to the child and her/his needs\n* Limitation of materials, so that only material that supports the child's development is included\n* Order\n* Nature in the classroom and outside of the classroom\n}}\n\n===Planes of development===\nMontessori observed four distinct periods, or \"planes\", in human development, extending from birth to 6 years, from 6 to 12, from 12 to 18, and from 18 to 24. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes and called for educational approaches specific to each period.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Four Planes of Development|journal=AMI Communications|year=1969|issue=2/3|pages=4\u201310}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Grazzini|first=Camillo|title=The Four Planes of Development: A Constructive Rhythm of Life|journal=Montessori Today|date=Jan\u2013Feb 1988|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe first plane extends from birth to around six years of age. During this period, Montessori observed that the child undergoes striking physical and psychological development. The first-plane child is seen as a concrete, sensorial explorer and learner engaged in the developmental work of psychological self-construction and building functional independence. Montessori introduced several concepts to explain this work, including the absorbent mind, sensitive periods, and normalization.\n\nMontessori described the young child's behavior of effortlessly assimilating the sensorial stimuli of his or her environment, including information from the senses, language, culture, and the development of concepts with the term \"absorbent mind\". She believed that this is a power unique to the first plane, and that it fades as the child approached age six.<ref name=Montessori1967>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Absorbent Mind|year=1967|publisher=Delta|location=New York|isbn=978-0-440-55056-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780440550563}}</ref> Montessori also observed and discovered periods of special sensitivity to particular stimuli during this time which she called the \"sensitive periods\". In Montessori education, the classroom environment responds to these periods by making appropriate materials and activities available while the periods are active in each individual young child. She identified the following periods and their durations:<ref name=Standing/>{{rp|118\u2013140}}\n\n* [[Language acquisition|Acquisition of language]]\u2014from birth to around 6 years old\n* Interest in small objects\u2014from around 18&nbsp;months to 3 years old\n* Order\u2014from around 1 to 3 years old\n* Sensory refinement\u2014from birth to around 4 years old\n* [[Social behavior]]\u2014from around 2\u00bd to 4 years old\n\nFinally, Montessori observed in children from three to six years old a psychological state she termed \"normalization\".<ref>\"[http://www.montessori-namta.org/The-Process-of-Normalization The Process of Normalization].\" ''North American Montessori Teacher's Association.''</ref> Normalization arises from concentration and focus on activity which serves the child's developmental needs, and is characterized by the ability to concentrate as well as \"spontaneous discipline, continuous and happy work, social sentiments of help and sympathy for others.\"<ref name=Montessori1967/>{{rp|207}}\n\nThe second plane of development extends from around six years to twelve years old. During this period, Montessori observed physical and psychological changes in children, and developed a classroom environment, lessons, and materials, to respond to these new characteristics. Physically, she observed the loss of baby teeth and the lengthening of the legs and torso at the beginning of the plane, and a period of uniform growth following. Psychologically, she observed the \"herd instinct\", or the tendency to work and socialize in groups, as well as the powers of reason and imagination. Developmentally, she believed the work of the second plane child is the formation of intellectual independence, of moral sense, and of social organization.<ref name=Montessori1994>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=From Childhood to Adolescence|year=1994|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-1-85109-185-0}}</ref>{{rp|7\u201316}}\n\nThe third plane of development extends from around twelve years to around eighteen years of age, encompassing the period of [[adolescence]]. Montessori characterized the third plane by the physical changes of [[puberty]] and adolescence, but also psychological changes. She emphasized the psychological instability and difficulties in concentration of this age, as well as the creative tendencies and the development of \"a sense of justice and a sense of personal dignity.\" She used the term \"valorization\" to describe the adolescents' drive for an externally derived evaluation of their worth. Developmentally, Montessori believed that the work of the third plane child is the construction of the adult self in society.<ref name=Montessori1994/>{{rp|59\u201381}}\n\nThe fourth plane of development extends from around eighteen years to around twenty-four years old. Montessori wrote comparatively little about this period and did not develop an educational program for the age. She envisioned young adults prepared by their experiences in Montessori education at the lower levels ready to fully embrace the study of culture and the sciences in order to influence and lead civilization. She believed that economic independence in the form of work for money was critical for this age, and felt that an arbitrary limit to the number of years in university level study was unnecessary, as the study of culture could go on throughout a person's life.<ref name=Montessori1994/>{{rp|82\u201393}}\n\n<br />\n\n===Education and peace===\nAs Montessori developed her theory and practice, she came to believe that education had a role to play in the development of world peace.<ref name=Standing/>{{rp|80}} She felt that children allowed to develop according to their inner laws of development would give rise to a more peaceful and enduring civilization. From the 1930s to the end of her life, she gave a number of lectures and addresses on the subject saying in 1936,\n\n{{quotation |Preventing conflicts is the work of politics; establishing peace is the work of education.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=Education and Peace|year=1992|publisher=ANC-Clio|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-85109-168-3|pages=24}}</ref>}}\n\nShe received a total of six nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in a three-year period: 1949, 1950, and 1951.<ref name=Kramer/>{{rp|360}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?string=Montessori&action=simplesearch |title=Nomination Database \u2013 Peace |publisher=Nobelprize.org|year= |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref>\n\nElementary Montessori peace curriculum starts with Five Great Lessons that give a big picture of the world and life. They are educational stories that also spark the imagination of the students. The Five Great Lessons are \u2013 The Beginning of the Universe and Earth, Life Comes to Earth, Human Come to Earth, How Writing Began, and How Numbers Began. It is important to not rush through them and give time for research in between. It is also very important to share these lessons as early in the year as possible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montessoritraining.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-and-exploring-five-great.html |title=The Five Great Lessons for Montessori Elementary: An Introduction and Lesson Idea List |publisher= North American Montessori Center |year= 2009|accessdate=2018-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Education practices==\n[[File:White Pine Montessori School.jpg|thumb|300px|White Pine Montessori School in [[Moscow, Idaho]], US]]\n\n===Infant and toddler programs===\nMontessori classrooms for children under three fall into several categories, with a number of terms being used. A ''{{lang|it|nido}}'', Italian for \"nest\", serves a small number of children from around two months to around fourteen months, or when the child is confidently walking. A \"Young Child Community\" serves a larger number of children from around one year to 2\u00bd or 3 years old. Both environments emphasize materials and activities scaled to the children's size and abilities, opportunities to develop movement, and activities to develop independence. Development of independence in toileting is typically emphasized as well. Some schools also offer \"Parent-Infant\" classes, in which parents participate with their very young children.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Montessori Infant-Toddler Program |url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\n===Preschool and kindergarten===\n[[File:Practical life class art Adebabs Inland Montessori School.jpg|thumb|left|Hand painting in a Montessori school of [[Nigeria]].]]\nMontessori classrooms for children from 2\u00bd or 3 to 6 years old are often called Children's Houses, after Montessori's first school, the Casa dei Bambini in Rome in 1906. This level is also called \"Primary\". A typical classroom serves 20 to 30 children in mixed-age groups, staffed by a fully trained lead teacher and assistants. Classrooms are usually outfitted with child-sized tables and chairs arranged singly or in small clusters, with classroom materials on child-height shelves throughout the room. Activities are for the most part initially presented by the teacher, after which they may be chosen more or less freely by the children as interest dictates. A teacher's role within a Montessori classroom is to guide and consult students individually by letting each child create their own learning pathway.  Classroom materials usually include activities for engaging in practical skills such as pouring and spooning, washing up, scrubbing tables and sweeping. Also materials for the development of the senses, mathematical materials, language materials, music, art and cultural materials, including more science based activities like 'sink and float', Magnetic and Non magnetic and candle and air.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Montessori Preschool Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\nActivities in Children's Houses are typically hands on, tactile materials to teach concepts. For example, to teach writing, students use sandpaper letters. These are letters created by cutting letters out of sandpaper and placing them on wooden blocks. The children then trace these letters with their fingers to learn the shape and sound of each letter. Another example is the use of bead chains to teach math concepts, specifically multiplication. Specifically for multiples of 10, there is one bead that represents one unit, a bar of ten beads put together that represents 1\u00d710, then a flat shape created by fitting 10 of the bars together to represent 10\u00d710, and a cube created by fitting 10 of the flats together to represent 10\u00d710\u00d710. These materials help build a concrete understanding of basic concepts upon which much is built in the later years.\n\n===Elementary classrooms===\nElementary school classrooms usually serve mixed-age 6- to 9-year-old and 9- to 12-year-old groupings; 6- to 12-year-old groups are also used. Lessons are typically presented to small groups of children, who are then free to follow up with independent work of their own as interest and personal responsibility dictate. Montessori educators give interdisciplinary lessons examining subjects ranging from biology and history to theology, which they refer to as \"great lessons.\" These are typically given near the beginning of the school term and provide the basis for learning throughout the year. The great lessons offer inspiration and open doors to new areas of investigation.<ref>[http://www.ourkids.net/montessori-schools.php Guide to Montessori Education].</ref>\n\nLessons include work in language, mathematics, history, the sciences, the arts, etc. Student-directed explorations of resources outside the classroom are integral to the education.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Montessori Elementary Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> Montessori used the term \"cosmic education\" to indicate both the universal scope of lessons to be presented and the idea that education should help children realize the human role in the interdependent functioning of the universe.\n\n===Middle and high school===\nMontessori education for this level is less well developed than programs for younger children. Montessori did not establish a teacher training program or a detailed plan of education for adolescents during his or her lifetime. However, a number of schools have extended their programs for younger children to the middle school and high school levels. In addition, several Montessori organizations have developed teacher training or orientation courses and a loose consensus on the plan of study is emerging. Montessori wrote that, \"The essential reform of our plan from this point of view may be defined as follows: during the difficult time of adolescence it is helpful to leave the accustomed environment of the family in town and to go to quiet surroundings in the country, close to nature\".<ref>Montessori, 1989, p. 67</ref>\n\nSome Montessori schools for adolescents 12\u201318 are set in rural locations.\n\n==Studies==\nA 2017 review on evaluations of Montessori education studies states that broad evidence exists that certain elements of the Montessori method (e.g., teaching early literacy through a phonic approach embedded in a rich language context, providing a sensorial foundation for mathematics education) are effective. At the same time, it was concluded that while some evidence exists that children may benefit cognitively and socially from Montessori education that sticks to original principles, it is less clear whether modern adapted forms of Montessori education are as effective.<ref>Marshall, Chlo\u00eb; [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-017-0012-7 Montessori education: a review of the evidence base], \"npj Science of Learning\", Volume 2, id. 11 (10/2017)</ref> [[Angeline Stoll Lillard|Lillard]] (2017) also reviews research on the outcomes of Montessori education.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lillard|first=Angeline|title=Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius|year=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-998152-6|pages=351\u2013376}}</ref>\n\nA 1975 study published in ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'' showed that every year over a four year period from Pre-K to Grade 2 children under a Montessori program had higher mean scores on the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]] than those in [[DARCEE]] or traditional programs.<ref name=\"MillerDyer\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=L|last2=Dyer|first2=J|title=Four preschool programs: Their dimensions and effects |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|date=1975|volume=162|page=116|url=}}</ref>\n\nA 1981 study published in ''Young Children'' found that whilst Montessori programs could not be considered to have undergone detailed evaluation, but that they performed equal to or better than other programs in certain areas.<ref name=\"Chattin\">{{cite journal|last1=Chattin-McNichols|first1=John|title=The Effects of Montessori School Experience |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|date=July 1981|volume=36|issue=5|pages=49\u201366|jstor=42642922}}</ref> A 2006 study published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] found that \"when strictly implemented, Montessori education fosters social and academic skills that are equal or superior to those fostered by a pool of other types of schools.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lillard|first1=Angeline|last2=Else-Quest|first2=Nicole|title=Evaluating Montessori Education |journal=Science|date=29 September 2006|volume=313|issue=5795|pages=1893\u20134|doi=10.1126/science.1132362|pmid=17008512|url=http://www.montessori-science.org/Science_Evaluating_Montessori_Education_Lillard.pdf}}</ref> The study had a relatively small sample size and was severely criticized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|date=2007-02-02|title=Studying Students in Montessori Schools |journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5812|pages=596\u2013597|doi=10.1126/science.315.5812.596b|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17272701}}</ref> Another study in the Milwaukee Public Schools found that children who had attended Montessori from ages 3\u201311 outperformed their high school classmates several years later on mathematics and science;<ref>Dohrmann KR, Nishida TK, Gartner A, Lipsky DK, Grimm KJ (2007). \"High school outcomes for students previously in a public Montessori program\", ''Journal of Research in Childhood Education'' 22/2, pp. 205\u2013217</ref> another found that Montessori had some of the largest positive effects on achievement of all programs evaluated.<ref>Borman, 2003, ''Review of Education Research''</ref>\n\nSome studies have not found positive outcomes for children in Montessori classrooms, but this might be due to the implementation of Montessori.

In 1907, she opened her first classroom, the Casa dei Bambini, or Children's House, in a tenement building in Rome.<ref name=Kramer/>{{rp|112}} From the beginning, Montessori based her work on her observations of children and experimentation with the environment, materials, and lessons available to them. She frequently referred to her work as \"[[Maria Montessori#Scientific pedagogy|scientific pedagogy]]\".\n\nIn 1901, Maria Montessori met Alice and [[Leopoldo Franchetti]] (Baroness & Baron) of [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]]. They found many matching points between their work. Maria Montessori was invited to hold her first course for teachers and to set up a \"Casa dei Bambini\" at Villa Montesca, the home of the Franchettis in Citt\u00e0 di Castello. Maria Montessori decided to move to Citt\u00e0 di Castello, where she lived for two years and where she refined her methodology together with Alice Franchetti. In that period, she published her book in Citt\u00e0 di Castello. The Franchetti Barons financed the publication of the book, and the methodology had the name \"Method Franchetti-Montessori\". Alice Franchetti died in 1911 at the age of 37 years old.\n\nMontessori education had spread to the United States by 1912 and became widely known in educational and popular publications. As well, in 1913 [[Narcissa Cox Vanderlip]] and [[Frank A. Vanderlip]] founded the [[Scarborough School]], the first Montessori school in the U.S.<ref name=\"Narcissa\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/vanderlip-narcissa.cfm |title=Narcissa Cox Vanderlip (1879\u20131966) |publisher=.gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-12-31}}</ref><ref name=\"book\">{{cite book|last=Cheever|first=Mary|title=The Changing Landscape: A History of Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough|year=1990|publisher=Phoenix Publishing|location=West Kennebunk, Maine|isbn=978-0-914659-49-5|oclc=22274920}}</ref> However, conflict arose between Montessori and the American educational establishment. The 1914 critical booklet ''The Montessori System Examined'', by influential education teacher [[William Heard Kilpatrick]], limited the spread of Montessori's ideas, and they languished after 1914. Montessori education returned to the United States in 1960 and has since spread to thousands of schools there. Montessori continued to extend her work during her lifetime, developing a comprehensive model of psychological development from birth to age 24, as well as educational approaches for children ages 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12.\n\nMontessori education also spread throughout the world, including Southeast Asia and [[India]], where Maria Montessori [[Montessori in India|was interned during World War II]].\n\n==Montessori education theory==\n[[File:Montessori Classroom.jpg|thumb|A Montessori classroom in the United States.]]\nMontessori education is fundamentally a model of [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and an educational approach based on that model. The model has two basic principles. First, children and developing adults engage in psychological self-construction by means of interaction with their environments. Second, children, especially under the age of six, have an innate path of psychological development. Based on her observations, Montessori believed that children who are at liberty to choose and act freely within an environment prepared according to her model would act spontaneously for optimal development.\n\nMontessori saw universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as \"human tendencies\" in 1957. There is some debate about the exact list, but the following are clearly identified:<ref>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Mario|title=The Human Tendencies and Montessori Education|year=1966|publisher=Association Montessori Internationale|location=Amsterdam|url=http://amiusa.org/shop/the-human-tendencies-and-montessori-education|access-date=2011-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162508/http://amiusa.org/shop/the-human-tendencies-and-montessori-education|archive-date=2012-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=26em|\n* [[Abstraction#Abstraction in psychology|Abstraction]]\n* Activity\n* Communication\n* Exactness\n* Exploration\n* Manipulation (of the environment)\n* Order\n* Orientation\n* Repetition\n* Self-Perfection\n* Work (also described as \"purposeful activity\")\n}}\n\nIn the Montessori approach, these human tendencies are seen as driving behaviour in every stage of development, and education should respond to and facilitate their expression.\n\nMontessori education involves free activity within a \"prepared environment\", meaning an educational environment tailored to basic human characteristics, to the specific characteristics of children at different ages, and to the individual personalities of each child.<ref name=\"Lillard2011\">{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}</ref> The function of the environment is to help and allow the child to develop independence in all areas according to his or her inner psychological directives. In addition to offering access to the Montessori materials appropriate to the age of the children, the environment should exhibit the following characteristics:<ref name=Standing>{{cite book|last=Standing|first=E.

She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes and called for educational approaches specific to each period.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Four Planes of Development|journal=AMI Communications|year=1969|issue=2/3|pages=4\u201310}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Grazzini|first=Camillo|title=The Four Planes of Development: A Constructive Rhythm of Life|journal=Montessori Today|date=Jan\u2013Feb 1988|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe first plane extends from birth to around six years of age. During this period, Montessori observed that the child undergoes striking physical and psychological development. The first-plane child is seen as a concrete, sensorial explorer and learner engaged in the developmental work of psychological self-construction and building functional independence. Montessori introduced several concepts to explain this work, including the absorbent mind, sensitive periods, and normalization.\n\nMontessori described the young child's behavior of effortlessly assimilating the sensorial stimuli of his or her environment, including information from the senses, language, culture, and the development of concepts with the term \"absorbent mind\". She believed that this is a power unique to the first plane, and that it fades as the child approached age six.<ref name=Montessori1967>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=The Absorbent Mind|year=1967|publisher=Delta|location=New York|isbn=978-0-440-55056-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780440550563}}</ref> Montessori also observed and discovered periods of special sensitivity to particular stimuli during this time which she called the \"sensitive periods\". In Montessori education, the classroom environment responds to these periods by making appropriate materials and activities available while the periods are active in each individual young child. She identified the following periods and their durations:<ref name=Standing/>{{rp|118\u2013140}}\n\n* [[Language acquisition|Acquisition of language]]\u2014from birth to around 6 years old\n* Interest in small objects\u2014from around 18&nbsp;months to 3 years old\n* Order\u2014from around 1 to 3 years old\n* Sensory refinement\u2014from birth to around 4 years old\n* [[Social behavior]]\u2014from around 2\u00bd to 4 years old\n\nFinally, Montessori observed in children from three to six years old a psychological state she termed \"normalization\".<ref>\"[http://www.montessori-namta.org/The-Process-of-Normalization The Process of Normalization].\" ''North American Montessori Teacher's Association.''</ref> Normalization arises from concentration and focus on activity which serves the child's developmental needs, and is characterized by the ability to concentrate as well as \"spontaneous discipline, continuous and happy work, social sentiments of help and sympathy for others.\"<ref name=Montessori1967/>{{rp|207}}\n\nThe second plane of development extends from around six years to twelve years old. During this period, Montessori observed physical and psychological changes in children, and developed a classroom environment, lessons, and materials, to respond to these new characteristics. Physically, she observed the loss of baby teeth and the lengthening of the legs and torso at the beginning of the plane, and a period of uniform growth following. Psychologically, she observed the \"herd instinct\", or the tendency to work and socialize in groups, as well as the powers of reason and imagination. Developmentally, she believed the work of the second plane child is the formation of intellectual independence, of moral sense, and of social organization.<ref name=Montessori1994>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=From Childhood to Adolescence|year=1994|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-1-85109-185-0}}</ref>{{rp|7\u201316}}\n\nThe third plane of development extends from around twelve years to around eighteen years of age, encompassing the period of [[adolescence]]. Montessori characterized the third plane by the physical changes of [[puberty]] and adolescence, but also psychological changes. She emphasized the psychological instability and difficulties in concentration of this age, as well as the creative tendencies and the development of \"a sense of justice and a sense of personal dignity.\" She used the term \"valorization\" to describe the adolescents' drive for an externally derived evaluation of their worth. Developmentally, Montessori believed that the work of the third plane child is the construction of the adult self in society.<ref name=Montessori1994/>{{rp|59\u201381}}\n\nThe fourth plane of development extends from around eighteen years to around twenty-four years old. Montessori wrote comparatively little about this period and did not develop an educational program for the age. She envisioned young adults prepared by their experiences in Montessori education at the lower levels ready to fully embrace the study of culture and the sciences in order to influence and lead civilization. She believed that economic independence in the form of work for money was critical for this age, and felt that an arbitrary limit to the number of years in university level study was unnecessary, as the study of culture could go on throughout a person's life.<ref name=Montessori1994/>{{rp|82\u201393}}\n\n<br />\n\n===Education and peace===\nAs Montessori developed her theory and practice, she came to believe that education had a role to play in the development of world peace.<ref name=Standing/>{{rp|80}} She felt that children allowed to develop according to their inner laws of development would give rise to a more peaceful and enduring civilization. From the 1930s to the end of her life, she gave a number of lectures and addresses on the subject saying in 1936,\n\n{{quotation |Preventing conflicts is the work of politics; establishing peace is the work of education.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montessori|first=Maria|title=Education and Peace|year=1992|publisher=ANC-Clio|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-85109-168-3|pages=24}}</ref>}}\n\nShe received a total of six nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in a three-year period: 1949, 1950, and 1951.<ref name=Kramer/>{{rp|360}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?string=Montessori&action=simplesearch |title=Nomination Database \u2013 Peace |publisher=Nobelprize.org|year= |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref>\n\nElementary Montessori peace curriculum starts with Five Great Lessons that give a big picture of the world and life. They are educational stories that also spark the imagination of the students. The Five Great Lessons are \u2013 The Beginning of the Universe and Earth, Life Comes to Earth, Human Come to Earth, How Writing Began, and How Numbers Began. It is important to not rush through them and give time for research in between. It is also very important to share these lessons as early in the year as possible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://montessoritraining.blogspot.com/2009/09/introducing-and-exploring-five-great.html |title=The Five Great Lessons for Montessori Elementary: An Introduction and Lesson Idea List |publisher= North American Montessori Center |year= 2009|accessdate=2018-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Education practices==\n[[File:White Pine Montessori School.jpg|thumb|300px|White Pine Montessori School in [[Moscow, Idaho]], US]]\n\n===Infant and toddler programs===\nMontessori classrooms for children under three fall into several categories, with a number of terms being used. A ''{{lang|it|nido}}'', Italian for \"nest\", serves a small number of children from around two months to around fourteen months, or when the child is confidently walking. A \"Young Child Community\" serves a larger number of children from around one year to 2\u00bd or 3 years old. Both environments emphasize materials and activities scaled to the children's size and abilities, opportunities to develop movement, and activities to develop independence. Development of independence in toileting is typically emphasized as well. Some schools also offer \"Parent-Infant\" classes, in which parents participate with their very young children.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Montessori Infant-Toddler Program |url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\n===Preschool and kindergarten===\n[[File:Practical life class art Adebabs Inland Montessori School.jpg|thumb|left|Hand painting in a Montessori school of [[Nigeria]].]]\nMontessori classrooms for children from 2\u00bd or 3 to 6 years old are often called Children's Houses, after Montessori's first school, the Casa dei Bambini in Rome in 1906. This level is also called \"Primary\". A typical classroom serves 20 to 30 children in mixed-age groups, staffed by a fully trained lead teacher and assistants. Classrooms are usually outfitted with child-sized tables and chairs arranged singly or in small clusters, with classroom materials on child-height shelves throughout the room. Activities are for the most part initially presented by the teacher, after which they may be chosen more or less freely by the children as interest dictates. A teacher's role within a Montessori classroom is to guide and consult students individually by letting each child create their own learning pathway.  Classroom materials usually include activities for engaging in practical skills such as pouring and spooning, washing up, scrubbing tables and sweeping. Also materials for the development of the senses, mathematical materials, language materials, music, art and cultural materials, including more science based activities like 'sink and float', Magnetic and Non magnetic and candle and air.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Montessori Preschool Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\nActivities in Children's Houses are typically hands on, tactile materials to teach concepts. For example, to teach writing, students use sandpaper letters. These are letters created by cutting letters out of sandpaper and placing them on wooden blocks. The children then trace these letters with their fingers to learn the shape and sound of each letter. Another example is the use of bead chains to teach math concepts, specifically multiplication. Specifically for multiples of 10, there is one bead that represents one unit, a bar of ten beads put together that represents 1\u00d710, then a flat shape created by fitting 10 of the bars together to represent 10\u00d710, and a cube created by fitting 10 of the flats together to represent 10\u00d710\u00d710. These materials help build a concrete understanding of basic concepts upon which much is built in the later years.\n\n===Elementary classrooms===\nElementary school classrooms usually serve mixed-age 6- to 9-year-old and 9- to 12-year-old groupings; 6- to 12-year-old groups are also used. Lessons are typically presented to small groups of children, who are then free to follow up with independent work of their own as interest and personal responsibility dictate. Montessori educators give interdisciplinary lessons examining subjects ranging from biology and history to theology, which they refer to as \"great lessons.\" These are typically given near the beginning of the school term and provide the basis for learning throughout the year. The great lessons offer inspiration and open doors to new areas of investigation.<ref>[http://www.ourkids.net/montessori-schools.php Guide to Montessori Education].</ref>\n\nLessons include work in language, mathematics, history, the sciences, the arts, etc. Student-directed explorations of resources outside the classroom are integral to the education.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Montessori Elementary Program|url=http://www.montessori-namta.org/Index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87|publisher=North American Montessori Teachers Association|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> Montessori used the term \"cosmic education\" to indicate both the universal scope of lessons to be presented and the idea that education should help children realize the human role in the interdependent functioning of the universe.\n\n===Middle and high school===\nMontessori education for this level is less well developed than programs for younger children. Montessori did not establish a teacher training program or a detailed plan of education for adolescents during his or her lifetime. However, a number of schools have extended their programs for younger children to the middle school and high school levels. In addition, several Montessori organizations have developed teacher training or orientation courses and a loose consensus on the plan of study is emerging.
