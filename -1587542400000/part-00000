Circle dancing is probably the oldest known dance formation and was part of community life from when people first started to dance.\n\nDancing in a circle is an ancient [[traditional dance|tradition]] common to many cultures for marking [[Ceremony|special occasions]], [[ritual]]s, strengthening community and encouraging [[Solidarity|togetherness]]. The dance can also be enjoyed as an uplifting group experience or as part of a [[meditation]]. Circle dances are choreographed to many different [[music genres|styles of music]] and rhythms.\n\nUnlike [[line dancing]], circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the [[connection (dance)|connection]] is made by [[handhold (dance)|hand-to-hand]], finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders. It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of [[partner dance|partner]]s. Generally, the participants follow a leader around the dance floor while holding the hand of the dancers beside them. The dance can be gentle or energetic.\n\nModern circle dance mixes traditional [[folk dance]]s, mainly from European or [[Near East]]ern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern. There is also a growing repertoire of new circle dances to [[classical music]] and [[pop music|contemporary songs]].<ref name=gilbert>International Folk Dance at a Glance. Second Edition.

The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing  around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other's hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs. When more and more dancers join the dance ring, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faroese Chain Dance |url=https://www.faroeislands.fo/arts-culture/customs/chain-dance/ |publisher=Faroe Islands.fo |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Sacred Circle Dance====\n{{further|Sacred dance}}\n\nThe ''Sacred Circle Dance'' was brought to the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community in [[Scotland]] by [[Bernhard Wosien]]; he presented traditional circle dances that he had gathered from across [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Watts, 2006. pages 6\u201310</ref> \nColin Harrison and David Roberts and Janet Rowan Scott took the dances to other parts of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] where they started regular groups in south east [[England]] and [[Somerset]], then across [[Europe]], the US and elsewhere.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ({{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d}}) at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own.

There are many versions of Tamzara, with slightly different music and steps, coming from the various regions and old villages in Anatolia. Firstly they step three steps ahead and strike their left feet on the ground and then they put their left feet ahead and for a while stand on it, then they make three little steps back and speed their actions a bit more in the second part with the actions of the first part. Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked little fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1904&Itemid=63|title=PontosWorld|author=|date=|website=pontosworld.com}}</ref>\n<!--[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0414\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d 08.jpg|230px|thumb|[[Khorovod]] in [[Belgorod Oblast]], Russia, 2014]]-->\n<!--[[File:KOCIS Korea Namsan Ganggangsulae 09 (9771197415).jpg|230px|thumb|''[[Ganggangsullae]]'' of [[Korea]]]]-->\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[International folk dance]]\n* [[Circumambulation]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n\n* B.

Circle dancing is probably the oldest known dance formation and was part of community life from when people first started to dance.\n\nDancing in a circle is an ancient [[traditional dance|tradition]] common to many cultures for marking [[Ceremony|special occasions]], [[ritual]]s, strengthening community and encouraging [[Solidarity|togetherness]]. The dance can also be enjoyed as an uplifting group experience or as part of a [[meditation]]. Circle dances are choreographed to many different [[music genres|styles of music]] and rhythms.\n\nUnlike [[line dancing]], circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the [[connection (dance)|connection]] is made by [[handhold (dance)|hand-to-hand]], finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders. It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of [[partner dance|partner]]s. Generally, the participants follow a leader around the dance floor while holding the hand of the dancers beside them. The dance can be gentle or energetic.\n\nModern circle dance mixes traditional [[folk dance]]s, mainly from European or [[Near East]]ern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern. There is also a growing repertoire of new circle dances to [[classical music]] and [[pop music|contemporary songs]].<ref name=gilbert>International Folk Dance at a Glance. Second Edition.

Despite its immense reputation in the Middle East and [[southeast Europe]], circle dancing also has a historical prominence in [[Brittany]], [[Catalonia]] and [[Irish dance|Ireland]] to the [[Western Europe|west of Europe]], and also in [[South America]] ([[Culture of Peru|Peruvian]]), [[Tibetan culture|Tibet]], and with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (see [[ghost dance]]).

The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing  around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other's hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs. When more and more dancers join the dance ring, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faroese Chain Dance |url=https://www.faroeislands.fo/arts-culture/customs/chain-dance/ |publisher=Faroe Islands.fo |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Sacred Circle Dance====\n{{further|Sacred dance}}\n\nThe ''Sacred Circle Dance'' was brought to the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community in [[Scotland]] by [[Bernhard Wosien]]; he presented traditional circle dances that he had gathered from across [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Watts, 2006. pages 6\u201310</ref> \nColin Harrison and David Roberts and Janet Rowan Scott took the dances to other parts of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] where they started regular groups in south east [[England]] and [[Somerset]], then across [[Europe]], the US and elsewhere.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ({{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d}}) at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own.

There are multiple foot patterns that dancers perform. The head of the khigga line usually dances with an handkerchief with beads and bells added to the sides so it jingles when shaken.

Firstly they step three steps ahead and strike their left feet on the ground and then they put their left feet ahead and for a while stand on it, then they make three little steps back and speed their actions a bit more in the second part with the actions of the first part. Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked little fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1904&Itemid=63|title=PontosWorld|author=|date=|website=pontosworld.com}}</ref>\n<!--[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 \u0414\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d 08.jpg|230px|thumb|[[Khorovod]] in [[Belgorod Oblast]], Russia, 2014]]-->\n<!--[[File:KOCIS Korea Namsan Ganggangsulae 09 (9771197415).jpg|230px|thumb|''[[Ganggangsullae]]'' of [[Korea]]]]-->\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[International folk dance]]\n* [[Circumambulation]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n\n* B.
