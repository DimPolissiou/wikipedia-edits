Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of record passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 100-day passage in 1854. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including two record passages in 1855\u20131856. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of record passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 100-day passage in 1854. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including two record passages in 1855\u20131856. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

In parts of the Atlantic Ocean, their populations have declined by over 95% in the past 30 years.  Among the reasons for this drop off are overfishing and the rise in demand for shark fins. Researchers attribute this growth in demand to the increase in shark fins as an expensive delicacy (such as in [[shark fin soup]]) and are calling for a ban on [[shark finning]], a practice in which the shark's fins are cut off and the rest of the animal is thrown back in the water to die. Hammerheads are among the most commonly caught sharks for finning.<ref name=\"End\">{{cite web |  title=Hammerhead Shark Makes Endangered Species List | publisher= redorbit.com | url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1259813/hammerhead_shark_makes_endangered_species_list/ |date=February 19, 2008|author=Savage, Sam }}</ref> They aren't considered to be dangerous to humans and if they do harm a human it is because they live in estuaries and attack out of surprise.<ref name=\"sharkinfo.ch\"/>\n\n=== Trade ===\nHammerhead sharks are over fished all around the world for their fins and liver oil.

They did this to ensure public access to the [[public domain]]. The Archive ensured the items were attributed and linked back to Google, which never complained, while libraries \"grumbled\". According to Kahle, this is an example of Swartz's \"genius\" to work on what could give the most to the public good for millions of people.<ref name=kahle-aswmem>Brewster Kahle, ''[https://archive.org/details/AaronSwartzMemorialAtTheInternetArchive?start=4680 Aaron Swartz memorial at the Internet Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629062022/https://archive.org/details/AaronSwartzMemorialAtTheInternetArchive?start=4680 |date=June 29, 2015 }}'', 2013-01-24, via [https://wellpreparedmind.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/aaron-swartz-freed-over-900000-public-domain-books-from-googles-restrictions/ The well-prepared mind] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814162152/http://wellpreparedmind.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/aaron-swartz-freed-over-900000-public-domain-books-from-googles-restrictions/ |date=August 14, 2014 }}, via [http://scinfolex.com/2013/02/06/cest-aaron-swartz-qui-liberait-les-livres-de-google-books-sur-internet-archive/ S.I.Lex] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808094118/http://scinfolex.com/2013/02/06/cest-aaron-swartz-qui-liberait-les-livres-de-google-books-sur-internet-archive/ |date=August 8, 2014 }}.</ref> {{anchor|RECAP US Federal Court Documents}}Besides books, the Archive offers free and anonymous public access to more than four million court opinions, legal briefs, or exhibits uploaded from the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States Federal Courts]]' [[PACER (law)|PACER]] electronic document system via the [[RECAP]] web browser plugin.

This Library would remain as such until at least June 30, 2020 or until the US national emergency was over, whichever came later. \n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/internet-archive-offers-thousands-of-copyrighted-books-for-free-online/|title=Internet Archive offers 1.4 million copyrighted books for free online|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|date=2020-03-28|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Archive justified the move as \"our unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research material\", and that because libraries predated copyright systems, they serve a key public function under critical times. However, the Archive had already been criticized by authors and publishers for its prior lending approach, and upon announcement of the National Emergency Library, authors, publishers, and groups representing both took further issue, equating the move to [[copyright infringement]] and digital piracy, and using the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason to push the boundaries of copyright (see also: {{slink|Open Library#Copyright violation accusations}}).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/30/internet-archive-accused-of-using-covid-19-as-an-excuse-for-piracy | title = Internet Archive accused of using Covid-19 as 'an excuse for piracy' | first =  Alison | last = Flood | date = March 30, 2020 | accessdate = March 30, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.npr.org/2020/03/30/823797545/authors-publishers-condemn-the-national-emergency-library-as-piracy  | title = Authors, Publishers Condemn The 'National Emergency Library' As 'Piracy' | first =Colin | last = Dwyer | date = March 30, 2020 | accessdate  = March 30, 2020 | work = [[NPR]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/2/21201193/emergency-library-internet-archive-controversy-coronavirus-pandemic | title = Why authors are so angry about the Internet Archive's Emergency Library | first = Constance | last = Grady | date = April 2, 2020 | accessdate = April 2, 2020  |work = [[Vox (website)|Vox]] }}</ref> In response the Internet Archive did allow authors and rights holders to submit opt-out requests for their works to be omitted from the National Emergency Library.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/the-national-emergency-library-and-its-discontents/ | title = The National Emergency Library and Its Discontents | first =  Noam | last= Cohen | date = April 20, 2020 | accessdate = April 20, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>\n\n==Ceramic archivists collection==\n[[File:Ceramic Archivists by sculptor Nuala Creed at Internet Archive.jpg|thumb|[[Ceramic]] figures of Internet Archive employees]]\n\nThe Great Room of the Internet Archive features a collection of more than 100 [[Ceramic art|ceramic figures]] representing employees of the Internet Archive.
