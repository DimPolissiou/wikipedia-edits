Finding himself thrust into a world where politics overlap with police priorities, Bill defies protocol by personally taking part in a raid on a gang hideout, during which a gangster is killed in front of his children. Bill encourages his friend Cade to consider adopting the children since he and his wife are having trouble conceiving. Bill's godson Joseph is attacked while on duty at the county jail; an inmate steals his uniform and escapes. Under intense scrutiny, Bill contemplates resigning, but both his wife and his subordinate Bishop persuade him otherwise. After shutting down an [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] operation he considers ethically wrong, Bill takes Bishop and Cade on a mounted assault to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a cartel money launderer using information provided by Joseph. Bishop kills the inmate, the girl is saved, and the launderer agrees to cooperate. Cade tells his newly adopted son that if he intends to take revenge for his father's death, he'll have to stay and watch him.

A heartbroken Minnick convinces him to help her arrest a man who had threatened Luna, which turns out to be one of his informants maintaining his cover. Bill and Cade utilize Bill's old friend, a barber they refer to as \"The Mayor\", to help them track the gun used in the shooting. This leads them to a paroled convict who admits he already sold the weapon. London tries to embarrass Bill by falsely announcing the shooter's arrest to the media. Luna dies from complications from surgery and his death is formally reported to the department. Based on the suspect's word, Bill finds the real shooter, a mentally ill man named Donald Murphy who shot Luna after mistaking him for his abusive father.

Paula asks to be fired when told the hospital is cutting her department's funding, but Bill tells her to stay and fight. An associate of Evans bails him out with the intention of silencing him. Joseph and Minnick catch him red-handed and the shooter flips, revealing that Johnson is dirty and had Trent killed to hide his crimes.

Against London's advice that he's too emotionally invested, Bill takes charge and cuts a deal with Rose to trade some of the hostages for medical equipment. However, when he tries to breach the jail, he learns that Rose has anticipated this, having made extensive preparations. Bill makes the only move he has left: offering himself as a hostage, along with a promise that he'll help them escape, in return for Paula 's release. The surgery is completed, and Rose agrees to the deal. Bill instructs Cade to snipe Rose when they get to the roof, but she figures out the plan and takes him, Paula, and the rest of the hostages onto the roof in disguises.

Determined not to let the man's murder be written off like countless others, he visits the support group he'd been attending, which coincidentally is the group that helped save him years earlier when he was homeless. Bill comes under pressure from city administrators to either declare his candidacy or endorse London; despite his belief that London is not fit to be sheriff, Bill is concerned about the burdens of the job and how they affect his family. Cade gets a new lead when Joseph and Minnick find a security guard that matches a suspect description. The man is interrogated, and reveals he was paid to kill the veteran.

Bill meets with community activists at London's insistence; they pledge to throw their full support behind him should he choose to run. The boys are caught, and Bill successfully challenges London to do the right thing and charge them while declaring to the press that the city's affluent are in need of a reckoning. After saving Minnick's life, Joseph begins to seriously contemplate his growing feelings for her. Cade and Teresa are informed that the grandmother of their foster children has asked to see them.

Cade and Teresa let their children spend the day with their grandmother, and are shocked to learn that the arrangement could very well be permanent. Isobel calls Minnick and hides in a nearby library, where Minnick and Joseph track her while Bill and Cade deal with the enforcer's men. Isobel gets her hands on the enforcer's gun, but Minnick tells her to drop it and arrests him while ensuring she isn't charged. Bill offers Minnick her long-awaited promotion, but she refuses, saying she wants to finish Joseph's training. Bill contacts a reporter with damaging information about DA Riley, and gets Maggie to forgive him intruding on her personal choices. London asks Minnick to help him again, but she tells him their relationship is finished as she no longer feels comfortable betraying Bill's trust.

In the midst of it all, Cade is informed that he and Teresa have lost their case and nearly gives into the temptation to drink until Bill steps in to remind him that the fight's not over yet. Carter tells Joseph that by lying for him, he's earned the right to join the \"Lions\", a group of cops who chafe at the rules of the Department. Joseph apologizes to Bill and tells Carter he's done associating with him. Bill discovers that Riley has been meeting with Johnson and obtained the list of informants from him, which one of her people has since leaked. Angry and enraged, he persuades Johnson to name the mole and has him arrested, then takes Bishop, Cade, London, Minnick, and Joseph to rescue the Mayor. The abductors are all killed, and Bill has just enough time to make it to Maggie's ''quincea\u00f1era'' with several of his friends.

Finding himself thrust into a world where politics overlap with police priorities, Bill defies protocol by personally taking part in a raid on a gang hideout, during which a gangster is killed in front of his children. Bill encourages his friend Cade to consider adopting the children since he and his wife are having trouble conceiving. Bill's godson Joseph is attacked while on duty at the county jail; an inmate steals his uniform and escapes. Under intense scrutiny, Bill contemplates resigning, but both his wife and his subordinate Bishop persuade him otherwise. After shutting down an [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] operation he considers ethically wrong, Bill takes Bishop and Cade on a mounted assault to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a cartel money launderer using information provided by Joseph. Bishop kills the inmate, the girl is saved, and the launderer agrees to cooperate. Cade tells his newly adopted son that if he intends to take revenge for his father's death, he'll have to stay and watch him.

A heartbroken Minnick convinces him to help her arrest a man who had threatened Luna, which turns out to be one of his informants maintaining his cover. Bill and Cade utilize Bill's old friend, a barber they refer to as \"The Mayor\", to help them track the gun used in the shooting. This leads them to a paroled convict who admits he already sold the weapon. London tries to embarrass Bill by falsely announcing the shooter's arrest to the media. Luna dies from complications from surgery and his death is formally reported to the department. Based on the suspect's word, Bill finds the real shooter, a mentally ill man named Donald Murphy who shot Luna after mistaking him for his abusive father.

A social worker tells Cade and Theresa that they need to determine if their adopted children want to stay with them. Minnick is assigned as Joseph's new training officer, and secretly accepts an offer from London to use her position to spy on Bill so she won't risk a promised promotion.

She names her fellow smuggler as Ernesto Diaz, who Bill orders to be released from custody, correctly suspecting that his fellow gangsters will torture him out of fear that he talked.

Although Evans insists he wasn't responsible, Bill checks in with Johnson, the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective handling the case, and learns that he was in contact with Anderson with plans to start dealing himself. Joseph's efforts to investigate the shooting are also complicated by the hostility shown towards him as a black police officer; Minnick steps in to offer her insights about how to deal with having two separate, yet mutually exclusive identities. Paula asks to be fired when told the hospital is cutting her department's funding, but Bill tells her to stay and fight. An associate of Evans bails him out with the intention of silencing him.

While on duty at the county jail, Paula and her staff are taken hostage by an inmate, David Browder, and his psychotic girlfriend Rose; she demands, at gunpoint, that Paula perform lifesaving surgery on her boyfriend. Against London's advice that he's too emotionally invested, Bill takes charge and cuts a deal with Rose to trade some of the hostages for medical equipment. However, when he tries to breach the jail, he learns that Rose has anticipated this, having made extensive preparations. Bill makes the only move he has left: offering himself as a hostage, along with a promise that he'll help them escape, in return for Paula 's release. The surgery is completed, and Rose agrees to the deal. Bill instructs Cade to snipe Rose when they get to the roof, but she figures out the plan and takes him, Paula, and the rest of the hostages onto the roof in disguises. As the chopper descends, Bill pulls off his disguise, giving Cade just enough time to shoot Rose.

It had two long-serving head teachers, with Miss Annie Smith at the [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] from the start until her retirement in 1936 and then Mr H. N. R. Moore, who again only left to retire in 1963. He was succeeded by Mr R. E. Bowyer.\n\nAs the school expanded, larger premises were required, with a house named ''Barton Peveril'' purchased by 1918, which later gave its name to the institution officially recognised as '''Eastleigh County Secondary School, Barton Peveril'''. In 1932 there was another move, this time to a building in Desborough Road that had previously been used for a school, with the move marked by the name '''Eastleigh County High School'''. In 1957, the school moved to its current site and returned its original name of '''Barton Peveril School'''.\n\nThe last intake to the state coeducational grammar school was in 1972. Since 1973, only sixth form students have been enrolled.<ref name=\"bp-history\">{{cite web |url = http://www.barton-peveril.ac.uk/college-life/history/ |title = Barton Peveril College \u2013 History |accessdate = 11 May 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425210735/http://www.barton-peveril.ac.uk/college-life/history/ |archivedate = 25 April 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe current Principal is Jonathan Prest, who was preceded by Godfrey Glyn OBE who held the post from 1996 to 2008.<ref name=\"leaving-glyn\">{{Citation | title = Principal bids farewell to college | newspaper = Southern Daily Echo | date = 28 April 2008 | url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/2230147.Principal_bids_farewell_to_college/  | accessdate = 18 March 2010}}</ref> Peter Happ\u00e9 was principal between 1980 and 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/alumni/newsletter/9westroad2.pdf |title=9 West Road: A Newsletter of the Faculty of English |page=4 |editor-first=James |editor-last=Simpson |year=2002 |work= |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Barton Peveril 25-5-17.jpg|alt=A picture of the Nobel Courtyard, as taken from the roof of the Science Centre.|left|thumb|325x325px|A picture of the Nobel Courtyard, as taken from the roof of the Science Centre.]]\nThe campus, comprising six buildings and a library, is situated in the south of Hampshire.

It had two long-serving head teachers, with Miss Annie Smith at the [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] from the start until her retirement in 1936 and then Mr H. N. R. Moore, who again only left to retire in 1963. He was succeeded by Mr R. E. Bowyer.\n\nAs the school expanded, larger premises were required, with a house named ''Barton Peveril'' purchased by 1918, which later gave its name to the institution officially recognised as '''Eastleigh County Secondary School, Barton Peveril'''. In 1932 there was another move, this time to a building in Desborough Road that had previously been used for a school, with the move marked by the name '''Eastleigh County High School'''. In 1957, the school moved to its current site and returned its original name of '''Barton Peveril School'''.\n\nThe last intake to the state coeducational grammar school was in 1972. Since 1973, only sixth form students have been enrolled.<ref name=\"bp-history\">{{cite web |url = http://www.barton-peveril.ac.uk/college-life/history/ |title = Barton Peveril College \u2013 History |accessdate = 11 May 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425210735/http://www.barton-peveril.ac.uk/college-life/history/ |archivedate = 25 April 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe current Principal is Jonathan Prest, who was preceded by Godfrey Glyn OBE who held the post from 1996 to 2008.<ref name=\"leaving-glyn\">{{Citation | title = Principal bids farewell to college | newspaper = Southern Daily Echo | date = 28 April 2008 | url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/2230147.Principal_bids_farewell_to_college/  | accessdate = 18 March 2010}}</ref> Peter Happ\u00e9 was principal between 1980 and 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/alumni/newsletter/9westroad2.pdf |title=9 West Road: A Newsletter of the Faculty of English |page=4 |editor-first=James |editor-last=Simpson |year=2002 |work= |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Barton Peveril 25-5-17.jpg|alt=A picture of the Nobel Courtyard, as taken from the roof of the Science Centre.|left|thumb|325x325px|A picture of the Nobel Courtyard, as taken from the roof of the Science Centre.]]\nThe campus, comprising six buildings and a library, is situated in the south of Hampshire.

A pre-[[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense.

Stock exchanges often function as \"continuous auction\" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via [[open outcry]] at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an [[electronic trading platform]].<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nTo be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use [[electronic communication network]]s, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and \"[[dark pool]]s\" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a7\u00a72:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\n[[Initial public offering]]s of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the [[primary market]] and subsequent trading is done in the [[secondary market]]. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in [[stock market]]s are driven by various factors that, as in all [[free market]]s, affect the price of stocks (see [[stock valuation]]).\n\nThere is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be ''off exchange'' or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. This is the usual way that [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are traded.

One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] ([[:de:B\u00f6rse Frankfurt|Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse]]) established in 1585 in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Economist [[Ulrike Malmendier]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] argues that a share market existed as far back as [[ancient Rome]], that derives from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] \"Argentari\". In the [[Roman Republic]], which existed for centuries before the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was founded, there were ''societates publicanorum'', organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government. One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390&nbsp;B.C. Participants in such organizations had ''partes'' or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\". Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success. The ''societas'' declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors, as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n\nTradable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as a commonly used type of security were a more recent innovation, spearheaded by the Italian city-states of the late [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods.<ref>Stringham, Edward Peter; Curott, Nicholas A.: ''On the Origins of Stock Markets'' [Part IV: ''Institutions and Organizations''; Chapter 14], pp. 324-344, in ''The Oxford Handbook of Austrian Economics'', edited by [[Peter J.

The company paid an average dividend of over 16% per year from 1602 to 1650. Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first [[bear market]] syndicate, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to remain robust throughout the 17th century. By the 1620s, the company was expanding its securities issuance with the first use of corporate bonds.\n\n[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega and by other variations of his name, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman in 17th-century Amsterdam. His 1688 book ''Confusion of Confusions''<ref>[[Joseph de la Vega|De la Vega, Joseph]], ''Confusion de Confusiones'' (1688), ''Portions Descriptive of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange'', introduction by Hermann Kellenbenz, Baker Library, Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (1957)</ref> explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about [[stock trading]] and inner workings of a stock market, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher, the book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment.\n\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 075 - New Stock Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[London Stock Exchange]] in 1810]]\nIn England, [[William III of England|King William III]] sought to modernize the kingdom's finances to pay for its wars, and thus the first government bonds were issued in 1693 and the [[Bank of England]] was set up the following year. Soon thereafter, English [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] began going public. \n\nLondon's first stockbrokers, however, were barred from the old commercial center known as the Royal Exchange, reportedly because of their rude manners. Instead, the new trade was conducted from coffee houses along [[Exchange Alley, London|Exchange Alley]]. By 1698, a broker named John Castaing, operating out of [[Jonathan's Coffee House]], was posting regular lists of stock and commodity prices. Those lists mark the beginning of the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockbroking101.com/stockbroker-101-a-cool-history/ | title=Stockbroker 101 - A Cool History | publisher=Stockbroker 101}}</ref>\n\nOne of history's greatest [[financial bubble]]s occurred around 1720. At the center of it were the [[South Sea Company]], set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the [[Mississippi Company]], focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available. In 1720, at the height of the mania, there was even an offering of \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\n\nBy the end of that same year, share prices had started collapsing, as it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from the Americas were overblown. In London, Parliament passed the [[Bubble Act]], which stated that only royally chartered companies could issue public shares. In Paris, Law was stripped of office and fled the country. Stock trading was more limited and subdued in subsequent decades. Yet the market survived, and by the 1790s shares were being traded in the young United States. On May 17, 1792, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] opened under a [[platanus occidentalis]] (buttonwood tree) in [[New York City]], as 24 stockbrokers signed the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/hottopic/stock_market.html | title=History of the NY Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | date=May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Role of stock exchanges==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Neue Boerse von Suedosten-20120222.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[B\u00f6rse Frankfurt]] (founded in 1585)]]\n[[File:NYSE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[London Stock Exchange]], the [[City of London]]]]\n[[File:TokyoStockExchange1144.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], Tokyo]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Building.jpg|thumb|[[B3 (stock exchange)|B3]] is the largest stock exchange in Latin America]]\n[[File:Indonesia Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Indonesian Stock Exchange]] ''(Bursa Efek Indonesia)'' building in [[Jakarta]] is considered one of the oldest in Asia.]]\n[[File:Torre Axtel y Bolsa de Valores.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), it's the second largest stock exchanges in Latin America.]]\n[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]\nStock exchanges have multiple roles in the economy. This may include the following:<ref>{{cite journal | last=Diamond | first=Peter A. | authorlink= | year=1967 | title=The Role of a Stock Market in a General Equilibrium Model with Technological Uncertainty | journal=[[American Economic Review]] | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=759\u2013776 | doi= | jstor=1815367}}</ref>\n\n===Raising capital for businesses===\nBesides the borrowing capacity provided to an individual or firm by the [[banking system]], in the form of [[credit (finance)|credit]] or a loan, a stock exchange provides [[company|companies]] with the facility to raise [[Financial capital|capital]] for expansion through selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] to the investing public.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gilson |first=Ronald J. |authorlink= |author2=Black, Bernard S.  |year=1998 |title=Venture Capital and the Structure of Capital Markets: Banks Versus Stock Markets |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=47 |issue= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.46909 |url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=faculty_scholarship}}</ref>\n\n[[Capital intensive]] companies, particularly [[high tech]] companies, always need to raise high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges has been one of the most important funding sources for many capital intensive [[Startup company|startup]]s. {{confusing-short|text=After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges|reason=word grouping is ambiguous, especially with the word \"listed\" in there, but even without|post-text=(confusing syntax)|date=May 2019}}, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company is already generating sales and earnings, or the company has demonstrated credibility and potential from successful outcomes: clinical trials, market research, patent registrations, etc. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world in the total absence of sales, earnings, or any type of well-documented promising outcome. Though it's not as common, it still happens that highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups are listed for the first time in a major stock exchange. Additionally, there are smaller, specialized entry markets for these kind of companies with [[stock index]]es tracking their performance (examples include the [[Alternext]], [[CAC Small]], [[SDAX]], [[TecDAX]]).\n\n====Alternatives to stock exchanges for raising capital====\n===== Research and Development limited partnerships=====\nCompanies have also raised significant amounts of capital through [[R&D]] [[limited partnership]]s. Tax law changes that were enacted in 1987 in the United States changed the tax deductibility of investments in R&D limited partnerships. In order for a partnership to be of interest to investors today, the [[cash on cash return]] must be high enough to entice investors.\n\n=====Venture capital=====\nA general source of capital for startup companies has been [[venture capital]]. This source remains largely available today, but the maximum statistical amount that the venture company firms in aggregate will invest in any one company is not limitless (it was approximately $15 million in 2001 for a biotechnology company).\n\n=====Corporate partners=====\nAnother alternative source of cash for a private company is a corporate partner, usually an established multinational company, which provides capital for the smaller company in return for marketing rights, patent rights, or equity. Corporate partnerships have been used successfully in a large number of cases.\n\n===Mobilizing savings for investment===\nWhen people draw their savings and invest in shares (through an [[initial public offering]] or the [[seasoned equity offering]] of an already listed company), it usually leads to [[Rationality|rational]] allocation of resources because funds, which could have been consumed, or kept in idle [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] levels of firms.\n\n===Facilitating acquisitions===\nCompanies view acquisitions as an opportunity to expand [[product line]]s, increase distribution channels, hedge against volatility, increase their [[market share]], or acquire other necessary business [[asset]]s. A [[takeover bid]] or  [[mergers and acquisitions]] through the [[stock market]] is one of the simplest and most common ways for a company to grow by acquisition or fusion.\n\n===Profit sharing===\nBoth casual and professional [[stock investor]]s, as large as [[institutional investor]]s or as small as an ordinary [[Middle class|middle-class family]], through [[dividend]]s and [[stock price]] increases that may result in [[capital gain]]s, share in the wealth of profitable businesses. Unprofitable and troubled businesses may result in [[capital loss]]es for shareholders.\n\n===Corporate governance===\nBy having a wide and varied scope of owners, companies generally tend to improve management standards and [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] to satisfy the demands of these shareholders and the more stringent rules for public corporations imposed by public stock exchanges and the government. This improvement can be attributed in some cases to the price mechanism exerted through shares of stock, wherein the price of the stock falls when management is considered poor (making the firm vulnerable to a takeover by new management) or rises when management is doing well (making the firm less vulnerable to a takeover).  In addition, publicly listed shares are subject to greater transparency so that investors can make informed decisions about a purchase.  Consequently, it is alleged that public companies (companies that are owned by shareholders who are members of the general public and trade shares on public exchanges) tend to have better management records than [[privately held company|privately held companies]] (those companies where shares are not publicly traded, often owned by the company founders, their families and heirs, or otherwise by a small group of investors).\n\nDespite this claim, some well-documented cases are known where it is alleged that there has been considerable slippage in [[corporate governance]] on the part of some public companies, particularly in the cases of [[accounting scandal]]s. The policies that led to the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007\u201308 are also examples of corporate mismanagement. The mismanagement of companies such as [[Pets.com]] (2000), [[Enron]] (2001), [[One.Tel]] (2001), [[Sunbeam Products]] (2001), [[Webvan]] (2001), [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] (2002), [[MCI WorldCom]] (2002), [[Parmalat]] (2003), [[American International Group]] (2008), [[Bear Stearns]] (2008), [[Lehman Brothers]] (2008), [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors]] (2009) and [[Satyam Computer Services]] (2009) all received plenty of media attention.\n\nMany banks and companies worldwide utilize securities identification numbers ([[ISIN]]) to identify, uniquely, their stocks, bonds and other securities. Adding an ISIN code helps to distinctly identify securities and the ISIN system is used worldwide by funds, companies, and governments.\n\nHowever, when poor financial, ethical or managerial records become public, [[stock investor]]s tend to lose money as the stock and the company tend to lose value. In the stock exchanges, shareholders of underperforming firms are often penalized by significant share price decline, and they tend as well to dismiss incompetent management teams.\n\n===Creating investment opportunities for small investors===\nAs opposed to other businesses that require huge capital outlay, investing in shares is open to both the large and small [[stock investor]]s as minimum investment amounts are minimal. Therefore, the stock exchange provides the opportunity for small investors to own shares of the same companies as large investors.\n\n===Government capital-raising for development projects===\nGovernments at various levels may decide to borrow money to finance infrastructure projects such as sewage and water treatment works or housing estates by selling another category of [[Security (finance)|securities]] known as [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. These bonds can be raised through the stock exchange whereby members of the public buy them, thus loaning money to the government. The issuance of such bonds can obviate, in the short term, direct taxation of citizens to finance development\u2014though by securing such bonds with the full faith and credit of the government instead of with collateral, the government must eventually tax citizens or otherwise raise additional funds to make any regular coupon payments and refund the principal when the bonds mature.\n\n===Barometer of the economy===\nAt the stock exchange, share prices rise and fall depending, largely, on economic forces. Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. A [[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], or [[financial crisis]] could eventually lead to a [[stock market crash]]. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the [[stock index]]es can be an indicator of the general trend in the economy.\n\n==Listing requirements==\nEach stock [https://www.smartworking1.in/?m=1 exchange] imposes its own [[listing requirements]] upon companies that want to be listed on that exchange. Such conditions may include minimum number of shares outstanding, minimum market capitalization, and minimum annual income.\n\n===Examples of listing requirements===\nThe listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include:\n* '''New York Stock Exchange:''' the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf | title=Overview of NYSE Quantitative Initial Listing Standards | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n* '''NASDAQ Stock Exchange:''' [[NASDAQ]] requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/about/listing_information.stm | title=Applications, Notifications & Guides - Nasdaq Listing Center | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}</ref>\n* '''London Stock Exchange:''' the main market of the [[London Stock Exchange]] requires a minimum market capitalization (\u00a3700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient [[working capital]] for at least 12 months from the date of listing.\n* '''Bombay Stock Exchange:''' [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of {{INRConvert|250|m}} and minimum public float equivalent to {{INRConvert|100|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bseindia.com/ | title=Bombay Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nStock exchanges originated as [[mutual organization]]s, owned by its member stockbrokers. However, the major stock exchanges have ''demutualized'', where the members sell their shares in an [[initial public offering]]. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (1998), [[Euronext]] (merged with New York Stock Exchange), [[NASDAQ]] (2002), [[Bursa Malaysia]] (2004), the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (2005), [[Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles]], and the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] (2007).\n\nThe [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] can be characterized as quasi-state institutions insofar as they were created by government bodies in China and their leading personnel are directly appointed by the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]].\n\nAnother example is [[Tashkent Stock Exchange]] established in 1994, three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, mainly state-owned but has a form of a public corporation ([[joint-stock company]]). [[Korea Exchange]] (KRX) owns 25% less one share of the Tashkent Stock Exchange.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uzse.uz/abouts/history?locale=en | title=Stages of the Republican Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Tashkent Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, there were 15 licensed stock exchanges in the United States, of which 13 actively traded securities.

A pre-[[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 1600s, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specializes in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporations]] \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/01/is-asia-the-next-financial-center-of-the-world.html | title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? | work=[[CNBC]] | last=Murphy | first=Richard McGill | quote=As Richard McGill Murphy (2014) notes: \"In 1602 the Dutch East India Company opened the world's first stock exchange in Amsterdam.

Stock exchanges often function as \"continuous auction\" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via [[open outcry]] at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an [[electronic trading platform]].<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nTo be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use [[electronic communication network]]s, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and \"[[dark pool]]s\" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a7\u00a72:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\n[[Initial public offering]]s of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the [[primary market]] and subsequent trading is done in the [[secondary market]]. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in [[stock market]]s are driven by various factors that, as in all [[free market]]s, affect the price of stocks (see [[stock valuation]]).\n\nThere is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be ''off exchange'' or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. This is the usual way that [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are traded.

One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] ([[:de:B\u00f6rse Frankfurt|Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse]]) established in 1585 in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Economist [[Ulrike Malmendier]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] argues that a share market existed as far back as [[ancient Rome]], that derives from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] \"Argentari\". In the [[Roman Republic]], which existed for centuries before the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was founded, there were ''societates publicanorum'', organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government. One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390&nbsp;B.C. Participants in such organizations had ''partes'' or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\". Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success. The ''societas'' declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors, as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n\nTradable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as a commonly used type of security were a more recent innovation, spearheaded by the Italian city-states of the late [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods.<ref>Stringham, Edward Peter; Curott, Nicholas A.: ''On the Origins of Stock Markets'' [Part IV: ''Institutions and Organizations''; Chapter 14], pp. 324-344, in ''The Oxford Handbook of Austrian Economics'', edited by [[Peter J.

Curott: \"Business ventures with multiple shareholders became popular with ''commenda'' contracts in medieval Italy (Greif, 2006, p. 286), and Malmendier (2009) provides evidence that shareholder companies date back to ancient Rome. Yet the title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, where an active secondary market in company shares emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621. Other companies existed, but they were not as large and constituted a small portion of the stock market (Israel [1989] 1991, 109\u2013112; Dehing and 't Hart 1997, 54; dela Vega [1688] 1996, 173).\"</ref>\n\n===Establishment of formal stock exchanges===\n{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}\n{{Cquote|The stock market \u2014 the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do \u2014 would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs.

Yet the title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of seventeenth-century Amsterdam, where an active secondary market in company shares emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621.

The company paid an average dividend of over 16% per year from 1602 to 1650. Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first [[bear market]] syndicate, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to remain robust throughout the 17th century. By the 1620s, the company was expanding its securities issuance with the first use of corporate bonds.\n\n[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega and by other variations of his name, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman in 17th-century Amsterdam. His 1688 book ''Confusion of Confusions''<ref>[[Joseph de la Vega|De la Vega, Joseph]], ''Confusion de Confusiones'' (1688), ''Portions Descriptive of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange'', introduction by Hermann Kellenbenz, Baker Library, Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (1957)</ref> explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about [[stock trading]] and inner workings of a stock market, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher, the book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment.\n\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 075 - New Stock Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[London Stock Exchange]] in 1810]]\nIn England, [[William III of England|King William III]] sought to modernize the kingdom's finances to pay for its wars, and thus the first government bonds were issued in 1693 and the [[Bank of England]] was set up the following year. Soon thereafter, English [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] began going public. \n\nLondon's first stockbrokers, however, were barred from the old commercial center known as the Royal Exchange, reportedly because of their rude manners. Instead, the new trade was conducted from coffee houses along [[Exchange Alley, London|Exchange Alley]]. By 1698, a broker named John Castaing, operating out of [[Jonathan's Coffee House]], was posting regular lists of stock and commodity prices. Those lists mark the beginning of the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockbroking101.com/stockbroker-101-a-cool-history/ | title=Stockbroker 101 - A Cool History | publisher=Stockbroker 101}}</ref>\n\nOne of history's greatest [[financial bubble]]s occurred around 1720. At the center of it were the [[South Sea Company]], set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the [[Mississippi Company]], focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available. In 1720, at the height of the mania, there was even an offering of \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\n\nBy the end of that same year, share prices had started collapsing, as it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from the Americas were overblown. In London, Parliament passed the [[Bubble Act]], which stated that only royally chartered companies could issue public shares. In Paris, Law was stripped of office and fled the country. Stock trading was more limited and subdued in subsequent decades. Yet the market survived, and by the 1790s shares were being traded in the young United States. On May 17, 1792, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] opened under a [[platanus occidentalis]] (buttonwood tree) in [[New York City]], as 24 stockbrokers signed the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/hottopic/stock_market.html | title=History of the NY Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | date=May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Role of stock exchanges==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Neue Boerse von Suedosten-20120222.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[B\u00f6rse Frankfurt]] (founded in 1585)]]\n[[File:NYSE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[London Stock Exchange]], the [[City of London]]]]\n[[File:TokyoStockExchange1144.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], Tokyo]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Building.jpg|thumb|[[B3 (stock exchange)|B3]] is the largest stock exchange in Latin America]]\n[[File:Indonesia Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Indonesian Stock Exchange]] ''(Bursa Efek Indonesia)'' building in [[Jakarta]] is considered one of the oldest in Asia.]]\n[[File:Torre Axtel y Bolsa de Valores.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), it's the second largest stock exchanges in Latin America.]]\n[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]\nStock exchanges have multiple roles in the economy. This may include the following:<ref>{{cite journal | last=Diamond | first=Peter A. | authorlink= | year=1967 | title=The Role of a Stock Market in a General Equilibrium Model with Technological Uncertainty | journal=[[American Economic Review]] | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=759\u2013776 | doi= | jstor=1815367}}</ref>\n\n===Raising capital for businesses===\nBesides the borrowing capacity provided to an individual or firm by the [[banking system]], in the form of [[credit (finance)|credit]] or a loan, a stock exchange provides [[company|companies]] with the facility to raise [[Financial capital|capital]] for expansion through selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] to the investing public.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gilson |first=Ronald J. |authorlink= |author2=Black, Bernard S.  |year=1998 |title=Venture Capital and the Structure of Capital Markets: Banks Versus Stock Markets |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=47 |issue= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.46909 |url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=faculty_scholarship}}</ref>\n\n[[Capital intensive]] companies, particularly [[high tech]] companies, always need to raise high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges has been one of the most important funding sources for many capital intensive [[Startup company|startup]]s. {{confusing-short|text=After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges|reason=word grouping is ambiguous, especially with the word \"listed\" in there, but even without|post-text=(confusing syntax)|date=May 2019}}, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company is already generating sales and earnings, or the company has demonstrated credibility and potential from successful outcomes: clinical trials, market research, patent registrations, etc. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world in the total absence of sales, earnings, or any type of well-documented promising outcome. Though it's not as common, it still happens that highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups are listed for the first time in a major stock exchange. Additionally, there are smaller, specialized entry markets for these kind of companies with [[stock index]]es tracking their performance (examples include the [[Alternext]], [[CAC Small]], [[SDAX]], [[TecDAX]]).\n\n====Alternatives to stock exchanges for raising capital====\n===== Research and Development limited partnerships=====\nCompanies have also raised significant amounts of capital through [[R&D]] [[limited partnership]]s. Tax law changes that were enacted in 1987 in the United States changed the tax deductibility of investments in R&D limited partnerships. In order for a partnership to be of interest to investors today, the [[cash on cash return]] must be high enough to entice investors.\n\n=====Venture capital=====\nA general source of capital for startup companies has been [[venture capital]]. This source remains largely available today, but the maximum statistical amount that the venture company firms in aggregate will invest in any one company is not limitless (it was approximately $15 million in 2001 for a biotechnology company).\n\n=====Corporate partners=====\nAnother alternative source of cash for a private company is a corporate partner, usually an established multinational company, which provides capital for the smaller company in return for marketing rights, patent rights, or equity. Corporate partnerships have been used successfully in a large number of cases.\n\n===Mobilizing savings for investment===\nWhen people draw their savings and invest in shares (through an [[initial public offering]] or the [[seasoned equity offering]] of an already listed company), it usually leads to [[Rationality|rational]] allocation of resources because funds, which could have been consumed, or kept in idle [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] levels of firms.\n\n===Facilitating acquisitions===\nCompanies view acquisitions as an opportunity to expand [[product line]]s, increase distribution channels, hedge against volatility, increase their [[market share]], or acquire other necessary business [[asset]]s. A [[takeover bid]] or  [[mergers and acquisitions]] through the [[stock market]] is one of the simplest and most common ways for a company to grow by acquisition or fusion.\n\n===Profit sharing===\nBoth casual and professional [[stock investor]]s, as large as [[institutional investor]]s or as small as an ordinary [[Middle class|middle-class family]], through [[dividend]]s and [[stock price]] increases that may result in [[capital gain]]s, share in the wealth of profitable businesses. Unprofitable and troubled businesses may result in [[capital loss]]es for shareholders.\n\n===Corporate governance===\nBy having a wide and varied scope of owners, companies generally tend to improve management standards and [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] to satisfy the demands of these shareholders and the more stringent rules for public corporations imposed by public stock exchanges and the government. This improvement can be attributed in some cases to the price mechanism exerted through shares of stock, wherein the price of the stock falls when management is considered poor (making the firm vulnerable to a takeover by new management) or rises when management is doing well (making the firm less vulnerable to a takeover).  In addition, publicly listed shares are subject to greater transparency so that investors can make informed decisions about a purchase.  Consequently, it is alleged that public companies (companies that are owned by shareholders who are members of the general public and trade shares on public exchanges) tend to have better management records than [[privately held company|privately held companies]] (those companies where shares are not publicly traded, often owned by the company founders, their families and heirs, or otherwise by a small group of investors).\n\nDespite this claim, some well-documented cases are known where it is alleged that there has been considerable slippage in [[corporate governance]] on the part of some public companies, particularly in the cases of [[accounting scandal]]s. The policies that led to the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007\u201308 are also examples of corporate mismanagement. The mismanagement of companies such as [[Pets.com]] (2000), [[Enron]] (2001), [[One.Tel]] (2001), [[Sunbeam Products]] (2001), [[Webvan]] (2001), [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] (2002), [[MCI WorldCom]] (2002), [[Parmalat]] (2003), [[American International Group]] (2008), [[Bear Stearns]] (2008), [[Lehman Brothers]] (2008), [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors]] (2009) and [[Satyam Computer Services]] (2009) all received plenty of media attention.\n\nMany banks and companies worldwide utilize securities identification numbers ([[ISIN]]) to identify, uniquely, their stocks, bonds and other securities. Adding an ISIN code helps to distinctly identify securities and the ISIN system is used worldwide by funds, companies, and governments.\n\nHowever, when poor financial, ethical or managerial records become public, [[stock investor]]s tend to lose money as the stock and the company tend to lose value. In the stock exchanges, shareholders of underperforming firms are often penalized by significant share price decline, and they tend as well to dismiss incompetent management teams.\n\n===Creating investment opportunities for small investors===\nAs opposed to other businesses that require huge capital outlay, investing in shares is open to both the large and small [[stock investor]]s as minimum investment amounts are minimal. Therefore, the stock exchange provides the opportunity for small investors to own shares of the same companies as large investors.\n\n===Government capital-raising for development projects===\nGovernments at various levels may decide to borrow money to finance infrastructure projects such as sewage and water treatment works or housing estates by selling another category of [[Security (finance)|securities]] known as [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. These bonds can be raised through the stock exchange whereby members of the public buy them, thus loaning money to the government. The issuance of such bonds can obviate, in the short term, direct taxation of citizens to finance development\u2014though by securing such bonds with the full faith and credit of the government instead of with collateral, the government must eventually tax citizens or otherwise raise additional funds to make any regular coupon payments and refund the principal when the bonds mature.\n\n===Barometer of the economy===\nAt the stock exchange, share prices rise and fall depending, largely, on economic forces. Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. A [[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], or [[financial crisis]] could eventually lead to a [[stock market crash]]. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the [[stock index]]es can be an indicator of the general trend in the economy.\n\n==Listing requirements==\nEach stock exchange imposes its own [[listing requirements]] upon companies that want to be listed on that exchange. Such conditions may include minimum number of shares outstanding, minimum market capitalization, and minimum annual income.\n\n===Examples of listing requirements===\nThe listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include:\n* '''New York Stock Exchange:''' the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf | title=Overview of NYSE Quantitative Initial Listing Standards | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n* '''NASDAQ Stock Exchange:''' [[NASDAQ]] requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/about/listing_information.stm | title=Applications, Notifications & Guides - Nasdaq Listing Center | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}</ref>\n* '''London Stock Exchange:''' the main market of the [[London Stock Exchange]] requires a minimum market capitalization (\u00a3700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient [[working capital]] for at least 12 months from the date of listing.\n* '''Bombay Stock Exchange:''' [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of {{INRConvert|250|m}} and minimum public float equivalent to {{INRConvert|100|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bseindia.com/ | title=Bombay Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nStock exchanges originated as [[mutual organization]]s, owned by its member stockbrokers. However, the major stock exchanges have ''demutualized'', where the members sell their shares in an [[initial public offering]]. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (1998), [[Euronext]] (merged with New York Stock Exchange), [[NASDAQ]] (2002), [[Bursa Malaysia]] (2004), the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (2005), [[Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles]], and the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] (2007).\n\nThe [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] can be characterized as quasi-state institutions insofar as they were created by government bodies in China and their leading personnel are directly appointed by the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]].\n\nAnother example is [[Tashkent Stock Exchange]] established in 1994, three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, mainly state-owned but has a form of a public corporation ([[joint-stock company]]). [[Korea Exchange]] (KRX) owns 25% less one share of the Tashkent Stock Exchange.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uzse.uz/abouts/history?locale=en | title=Stages of the Republican Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Tashkent Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, there were 15 licensed stock exchanges in the United States, of which 13 actively traded securities. All of these exchanges were owned by three publicly traded multinational companies, [[Intercontinental Exchange]], [[Nasdaq, Inc.]], and [[Cboe Global Markets]], except one, [[IEX]].<ref name=Reuters1-19>{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallstreet-exchange-idUSKCN1P11A6 |title=Major Wall Street players plan exchange to challenge NYSE, Nasdaq | first=Diptendu | last=Lahiri | work=[[Reuters]] | date=January 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/competition-among-exchanges-has-reached-a-new-low-and-its-dangerous-for-the-stock-market-2018-5 | title=Competition among exchanges has reached a new low, and it's dangerous for the stock market | first=John | last=Ramsay | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=May 23, 2018}} (for recent history see also, {{Cite web | url=http://www.finra.org/investors/nyse-nasdaq-and-get-know-uss-stock-exchanges-part-1 |title=NYSE, Nasdaq and...?

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]]. Since 2019, China has the highest number of rich people in the world.{{efn|\"Rich people\" is defined here as the wealthiest 10% of the global population. {{As of|2019}}, this group holds assets of at least {{USD|109,400}}.}} China has been characterized as a [[potential superpower]], mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Names{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}==\n{{Main|Names of China}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|collapse=no\n|title=China\n|pic=China (Chinese characters).svg\n|piccap=\"China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=0.45\n| t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u570b}}\n| s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u56fd}}\n| p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\n| w=Chung\u00b9-kuo\u00b2\n| mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|g|wo|2}}\n| sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n| bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n| xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufed7\u064f\ufeee\u064e\u0639\n| tp=Jhonggu\u00f3\n| mps=J\u016bnggu\u00f3\n| gr=Jonggwo\n| myr=J\u016bnggw\u00f3\n| zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0439\n| poj=Tiong-kok\n| tl=Tiong-kok\n| gan=Tung-koe\u030dt\n| hsn=Tan<sup>33</sup>-kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n| wuu=Tson<sup>\u5e73</sup>-koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n| j=Zung1gwok3\n| y=J\u00f9nggwok ''or'' J\u016bnggwok\n| ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|gw|ok|3}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|gw|ok|3}}\n| h=Dung<sup>24</sup>-gued<sup>2</sup>\n| phfs=Ch\u00fbng-koet\n| buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-gu\u00f3k\n| hhbuc=De\u0324ng-go\u0324h\n| mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-g\u014f\n|tib = {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b}}\n|zwpy= Krung-go\n|mong = [[File:China in Mongolian.svg|35px|alt=Dumdadu ulus]]\n|monr =Dumdadu ulus\n|mnc = [[File:China in Manchu.svg|35px|alt=Dulimbai Gurun]]\n|mnc_rom =Dulimbai Gurun\n|uig = {{lang|ug|\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u06af\u0648}}\n|uly= Junggo\n|zha= Cungguek \n| altname = Alternate name\n| t2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef}}\n| s2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e}}\n| p2 = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\n| gan2 = tung<sup>1</sup> fa<sup>4</sup> ''or''<br />Chungfa\n| w2 = Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2\n| bpmf2 = \u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca|tp2 = Jhonghu\u00e1 |mps2 = J\u016bnghu\u00e1 |gr2 = Jonghwa |myr2 = J\u016bnghw\u00e1 |mi2 = {{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2}}\n| xej2 = \ufe9f\u0652\ufeee \ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \n| poj2 = Tiong-h\u00f4a\n| tl2 = Tiong-hu\u00e2\n| wuu2 = tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n| j2 = Zung1waa4\n| ci2 = {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4}}\n| y2 = J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h ''or'' J\u016bng'w\u00e0h\n| h2 = dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup>\n| phfs2 = Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0\n| buc2 = D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0\n| showflag=p\n| order=st\n| l={{nowrap|\"Middle\" or \"Central State\"<ref name=zg>{{citation |contribution=Reconstructing China beyond Homogeneity |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 105] |series=Political Theories in East Asian Context |title=Patriotism in East Asia |editor=Jun-Hyeok Kwak |editor2=Koichiro Matsuda |display-editors=0 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |date=2015 |last=Bilik |first=Naran }}</ref>}}}}\n \nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century.

Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]].

Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.
