The missile can be launched from:\n\n* [[Fixed-wing aircraft]] (the '''AGM-84''', without the [[solid-fuel rocket]] [[Booster (rocketry)|booster)]]\n* [[warship|Surface ships]] (the '''RGM-84''', fitted with a solid-fuel rocket booster that detaches when expended, to allow the missile's main [[turbojet]] to maintain flight)\n* [[Submarine]]s (the '''UGM-84''', fitted with a solid-fuel rocket booster and encapsulated in a container to enable submerged launch through a torpedo tube);\n* Coastal defense batteries, from which it would be fired with a solid-fuel rocket booster.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:USS Coronado Launches First Over-The-Horizon Missle Using a Harpoon Block 1C Missile in Pacific Ocean, July 19, 2016.jpg|thumb|left| {{USS|Coronado|LCS-4|6}} launches the first over-the-horizon missile engagement using a Harpoon Block 1C missile during the [[Exercise RIMPAC|Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) 2016]] in the Pacific Ocean, 21 July 2016.]]\n[[File:UGM-84 Harpoon at Submarine Force Museum entrance.jpg|thumb|Air intake (black triangle) for turbojet is visible on the underside]]\nIn 1965 the [[United States Navy]] began studies for a missile in the {{convert|45|km|nmi}} range class for use against surfaced [[submarine]]s. The name Harpoon was assigned to the project. The sinking of the Israeli [[destroyer]] {{INS|Eilat|1955|2}} in 1967 by a Soviet-built [[P-15 Termit|Styx]] anti-ship missile shocked senior United States Navy officers, who until then had not been conscious of the threat posed by anti-ship missiles. In 1970 [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]] accelerated the development of Harpoon as part of his \"Project Sixty\" initiative, hoping to add much-needed striking power to U.S. surface warships such as the{{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser}}.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe first Harpoon was delivered in 1977; in 2004, Boeing delivered the 7,000th. \n\nThe Harpoon has also been adapted for carriage on several aircraft, including the [[P-3 Orion]], the [[P-8 Poseidon]], the [[AV-8B Harrier II]], the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H bombers]]. The Harpoon was purchased by many American allies, including India, Japan, [[Singapore]], South Korea, [[Taiwan]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and most [[NATO]] countries.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Royal Australian Air Force]] can fire AGM-84-series missiles from its [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornets]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18A/B Hornets]], and [[Lockheed AP-3C Orion|AP-3C Orion]] aircraft, and previously from the now retired [[General Dynamics F-111C|F-111C/Gs]]. The [[Royal Australian Navy]] deploys the Harpoon on major surface combatants and in the {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|1}}s. The [[Spanish Air Force]] and the [[Chilean Navy]] are also AGM-84D customers, and they deploy the missiles on surface ships, and F/A-18s, F-16s, and [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion aircraft]]. The British [[Royal Navy]] deploys the Harpoon on several types of surface ships.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Navy]] carries Harpoon missiles on its {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate}}s. The [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] is looking at adding the capability of carrying a stand-off missile, probably Harpoon or AGM-65 Maverick, on its six P-3 Orion patrol planes once they have all been upgraded to P3K2 standard.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] also operates five modified [[Fokker 50]] Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) which are fitted with the sensors needed to fire the Harpoon missile. The [[Pakistani Navy]] carries the Harpoon missile on its frigates and P-3C Orions. The [[Turkish Navy]] carries Harpoons on surface warships and [[Type 209 submarine]]s. The [[Turkish Air Force]] will be armed with the SLAM-ER.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAt least 339 Harpoon missiles were sold to the [[Republic of China Air Force]] (Taiwan) for its F-16 A/B Block 20 fleet and the [[Republic of China Navy|Taiwanese Navy]], which operates four guided-missile destroyers and eight guided-missile frigates with the capability of carrying the Harpoon, including the eight former U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|1}}s and the four former USN {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer|1}}s which have been sold to Taiwan. The two {{sclass-|Zwaardvis|submarine|5}}/''Hai Lung'' submarines and 12 P-3C Orion aircraft can also use the missile. The eight {{sclass-|Cheng Kung|frigate|1}}s, despite being based on the US {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|4}}, have Harpoon capabilities deleted from their combat systems, and funding to restore it has so far been denied.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe Block 1 missiles were designated AGM/RGM/UGM-84A in US service and UGM-84B in the UK. Block 1B standard missiles were designated AGM/RGM/UGM-84C, Block 1C missiles were designated AGM/RGM/UGM-84D.

Pakistani officials denied this and they claimed that the US was referring to a new Pakistani-designed missile. Some international experts were also reported to be skeptical of the accusations. Robert Hewson, editor of [[Jane's Information Group|Jane's Air Launched Weapons]], pointed out that the Harpoon is not suitable for the land-attack role due to deficiency in range. He also stated that Pakistan was already armed with more sophisticated missiles of Pakistani or Chinese design and, therefore, \"beyond the need to reverse-engineer old US kit.\" Hewson offered that the missile tested by Pakistan was part of an undertaking to develop conventionally armed missiles, capable of being air- or surface-launched, to counter its rival India's missile arsenal.<ref>{{cite

Space & Security]]). The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] (SLAM) is a land-attack variant.\n\nThe regular Harpoon uses [[active radar homing]] and flies just above the water to evade defenses. The missile can be launched from:\n\n* [[Fixed-wing aircraft]] (the '''AGM-84''', without the [[solid-fuel rocket]] [[Booster (rocketry)|booster)]]\n* [[warship|Surface ships]] (the '''RGM-84''', fitted with a solid-fuel rocket booster that detaches when expended, to allow the missile's main [[turbojet]] to maintain flight)\n* [[Submarine]]s (the '''UGM-84''', fitted with a solid-fuel rocket booster and encapsulated in a container to enable submerged launch through a torpedo tube);\n* Coastal defense batteries, from which it would be fired with a solid-fuel rocket booster.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:USS Coronado Launches First Over-The-Horizon Missle Using a Harpoon Block 1C Missile in Pacific Ocean, July 19, 2016.jpg|thumb|left| {{USS|Coronado|LCS-4|6}} launches the first over-the-horizon missile engagement using a Harpoon Block 1C missile during the [[Exercise RIMPAC|Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) 2016]] in the Pacific Ocean, 21 July 2016.]]\n[[File:UGM-84 Harpoon at Submarine Force Museum entrance.jpg|thumb|Air intake (black triangle) for turbojet is visible on the underside]]\nIn 1965 the [[United States Navy]] began studies for a missile in the {{convert|45|km|nmi}} range class for use against surfaced [[submarine]]s. The name Harpoon was assigned to the project. The sinking of the Israeli [[destroyer]] {{INS|Eilat|1955|2}} in 1967 by a Soviet-built [[P-15 Termit|Styx]] anti-ship missile shocked senior United States Navy officers, who until then had not been conscious of the threat posed by anti-ship missiles. In 1970 [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]] accelerated the development of Harpoon as part of his \"Project Sixty\" initiative, hoping to add much-needed striking power to U.S. surface warships such as the{{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser}}.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe first Harpoon was delivered in 1977; in 2004, Boeing delivered the 7,000th. \n\nThe Harpoon has also been adapted for carriage on several aircraft, including the [[P-3 Orion]], the [[P-8 Poseidon]], the [[AV-8B Harrier II]], the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H bombers]]. The Harpoon was purchased by many American allies, including India, Japan, [[Singapore]], South Korea, [[Taiwan]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and most [[NATO]] countries.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Royal Australian Air Force]] can fire AGM-84-series missiles from its [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornets]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18A/B Hornets]], and [[Lockheed AP-3C Orion|AP-3C Orion]] aircraft, and previously from the now retired [[General Dynamics F-111C|F-111C/Gs]]. The [[Royal Australian Navy]] deploys the Harpoon on major surface combatants and in the {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|1}}s. The [[Spanish Air Force]] and the [[Chilean Navy]] are also AGM-84D customers, and they deploy the missiles on surface ships, and F/A-18s, F-16s, and [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion aircraft]]. The British [[Royal Navy]] deploys the Harpoon on several types of surface ships.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Navy]] carries Harpoon missiles on its {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate}}s. The [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] is looking at adding the capability of carrying a stand-off missile, probably Harpoon or AGM-65 Maverick, on its six P-3 Orion patrol planes once they have all been upgraded to P3K2 standard.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] also operates five modified [[Fokker 50]] Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) which are fitted with the sensors needed to fire the Harpoon missile. The [[Pakistani Navy]] carries the Harpoon missile on its frigates and P-3C Orions. The [[Turkish Navy]] carries Harpoons on surface warships and [[Type 209 submarine]]s. The [[Turkish Air Force]] will be armed with the SLAM-ER.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAt least 339 Harpoon missiles were sold to the [[Republic of China Air Force]] (Taiwan) for its F-16 A/B Block 20 fleet and the [[Republic of China Navy|Taiwanese Navy]], which operates four guided-missile destroyers and eight guided-missile frigates with the capability of carrying the Harpoon, including the eight former U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|1}}s and the four former USN {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer|1}}s which have been sold to Taiwan. The two {{sclass-|Zwaardvis|submarine|5}}/''Hai Lung'' submarines and 12 P-3C Orion aircraft can also use the missile.

Robert Hewson, editor of [[Jane's Information Group|Jane's Air Launched Weapons]], pointed out that the Harpoon is not suitable for the land-attack role due to deficiency in range. He also stated that Pakistan was already armed with more sophisticated missiles of Pakistani or Chinese design and, therefore, \"beyond the need to reverse-engineer old US kit.\" Hewson offered that the missile tested by Pakistan was part of an undertaking to develop conventionally armed missiles, capable of being air- or surface-launched, to counter its rival India's missile arsenal.<ref>{{cite

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts).

He was known after his hometown, [[Le\u017cajsk]] ({{lang-yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d6\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7|translit=Lizhensk}}) near [[Rzesz\u00f3w]] in [[Poland]]. He was part of the inner \"Chevraya Kadisha\" (Holy Society) school of the [[Maggid]] Rebbe [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] (second leader of the Hasidic movement), who became the decentralised, third generation leadership after the passing of Rebbe Dov Ber in 1772. Their dissemination to new areas of [[Eastern Europe]] led the movement's rapid revivalist expansion.\n\nRebbi Elimelech authored the classic [[Hasidic philosophy|work]] ''Noam Elimelech''. It developed the Hasidic theory of the [[Tzaddik]] into the full doctrine of \"''Practical/Popular Tzaddikism''\". This shaped the social role of [[Ayin and Yesh|mystical]] [[Rebbe|leadership]], characteristic of the \"''Mainstream Hasidic''\" path. He was the founder of Hasidism in [[Poland]]-[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and numerous leaders and [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] emerged from his disciples in the early 19th century, including the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], the [[Maggid of Koznitz]] and [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], one of the three \"Fathers of Polish Hasidism\". Because of this, Rebbi Elimelech is venerated by the \"Mainstream\" path in Hasidism, predominant especially in Poland, who descend from his influence.\n\n==Biography==\nRebbe Elimelech was born in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (Central Europe), which was located in the Kingdom of Poland that was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He died in [[Le\u017cajsk]] on the 21st of [[Adar]]. He was known as a [[Tzadik]] who devoted his life to studying and teaching the [[Torah]], as well as encouraging people to draw closer in return to God.\n\n===The brothers Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya===\nRebbe Elimelech was a prominent student of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], and was brought under his tutelage by his brother the famous Rebbe Reb [[Meshulam Zushya of Anipoli]]. Both brothers are central figures in Hasidic tradition and Reb Zushya is especially beloved for his sincerity and fervour. The two offered a contrast in the model of the Hasidic [[Rebbe]], with Elimelech the ascetic scholar, and Zushya giving the impression of the charismatic \"saintly simpleton\", although he too was well versed in [[Hasidic philosophy]]. Of all the students in the Maggid's \"Holy Society\" it is told that only Zushya could contain his [[dveikus]] (fervour) and remain in the room as the Maggid revealed fiery new teachings. The other students would faint or run out of the room in ecstasy.<ref>Cited in ''The Great Maggid'' by [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]]. Kehot Publications</ref> The two brothers would travel together in mystical exile of [[Teshuvah|repentance]] to atone on behalf of the whole Jewish people and the exile of the [[Shechinah]] (Divine Presence). Famous Hasidic tales are told of their encounters.\n<blockquote>\nOn one occasion, Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya were staying at an inn. Each night, gentile peasants would enter their room and jestingly beat the one who lay nearest the fireside, Reb Zushya. One night, Rabbi Elimelech offered to change places with his brother so that he could take the beatings instead. Suggesting that Reb Zushya had suffered enough of this \"Divine admonishment\", the agreement was made and Rabbi Elimelech lay next to the fire instead. That night, the common gentiles again entered to begin their jest. This time, however, one of them said that the one by the fire had taken his fair share of the treatment, and now it would be better to jest with the other one! Again Reb Zushya took the beatings. Afterwards, he told his brother that whatever is decided in Heaven transpires!\n</blockquote>\n\n===Hasidic Leadership===\nAfter the death of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], the Hasidic movement avoided one centralised leader, as had characterised it under the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and the Maggid. Instead the great leadership of students of the Maggid dispersed across Eastern Europe, from Poland to Russia, taking with them their different interpretations of Hasidism. Nonetheless, in this third generation, Rabbi Elimelech was considered by most of the Maggid's students and followers as his successor. He began the dissemination of Hasidism in Poland, which subsequently increased to a much greater extent under his foremost disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]].\n\nMany of Rebbe Elimelech's students (talmidim) went on to be Rebbes in their own right. The most famous are the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], the [[Kozhnitzer Maggid]], the [[Apter Rov]] and Rabbi [[Kalonymus Kalman Epstein|Kalonymus Kalman Halevi Epstein]], author of ''Maor Vashemesh''.\n\nTo this day his grave in [[Le\u017cajsk]], [[Poland]], is visited by thousands of those faithful to Hasidism, particularly on the anniversary of his death, the 21st of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]] (in leap years, commemorated twice, in Adar I and Adar II).<ref>David M.

This book is one of the principal works of [[Hasidism]]. The sefer was called ''Sefer Shel Tzadikim'', (a Book for the Righteous) by Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (founder of the [[Lubavitch]] dynasty).\n\nThe book has asterisks or stars placed in seemingly random places over words.  Tradition has it that these stars have some meaning. In ''Devarim Areivim'' (another [[Hasidic]] classic), the author, Rabbi Dov Ehrmann, wrote: \"In the first edition of the sefer, there are in many places small stars which allude to some secret meaning\". The [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenberger]] [[Rebbe]] once said that the stars in the heavens are a commentary to the stars in the book ''Noam Elimelech''. As such, all subsequent printings have included these stars.\n\nRabbi Elimelech also wrote ''Tzetl Koton'', a seventeen-point program on how to be a good Jew, and ''Hanhagos HaAdam'', a list of [[Minhag|customs]] for all pious Jews to follow.\n\n===Three Hasidic mystical paths===\n[[Image:Lizhenskgrave.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] Rebbe of America praying in the [[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Rabbi Elimelech. His grave is venerated in pilgrimage by \"Mainstream\"-Polish [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] and their followers, as their spiritual path in Hasidism descends from his influence]]\nA Hasidic aphorism<ref>In ''Transforming Darkness into Light: Kabbalah and Psychology'' (Teachings of Kabbalah Series), [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]], Gal Einai Pub.</ref> describes three paths of mysticism in the Hasidic movement, formed by three works of Hasidic thought. [[Nachman of Breslov]]'s ''Likkutei Moharan'' is described as the Hasidic book of the great, giving hope and encouragement to those trapped in problems, through Rabbi Nachman's innovative creativity and the personal [[Hitbodedut|articulation]] of one's problems to God. [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]]'s ''[[Tanya]]'' is subtitled the Hasidic book for the intermediate person, who has ease to intellectually [[Hisbonenus|contemplate]] and internalise [[Hasidic thought]], free from distracting troubles. In this [[Habad]] path, the Tzadik's primary role is to teach the esoteric dimension of Hasidism in intellectual understanding. ''Noam Elimelech'' is seen as the formative book of the righteous [[Tzadik]]. It instructs select people of spiritual ability how to become Hasidic mystical leaders, while advocating attachment to the Tzadik by the common folk. Because of this, ''Noam Elimelech'' influenced the Mainstream Hasidic proliferation of the Tzadik, who embodies and channels the [[Ayin and Yesh|Ayin-Yesh]] Divine flow of blessing to this world. The [[Chozeh of Lublin]] (1745-1815) developed further the dynamics of this process. Meanwhile, the mid-19th century [[Simcha Bunim of Peshischa|Peshischa]]-[[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk|Kotzk]] spiritual development in Hasidism and its influence, is excluded from this description. It left aside ''Tzaddikism'' and mystical focus in favour of personal autonomy, introspection and Rabbinic [[Torah study]] in the spirit of Hasidic spiritual inwardness. The ''Yid HaKodosh'' of [[Przysucha]] in Poland began this trend when he broke away from the Chozeh of Lublin's Tzadik focused spiritual path.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://lizensk.com ''Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk'' ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080612150258/http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/books/html/bk1194026.htm ''Digitized 1st Edition Hebrew Noam Elimelech'']\n* [https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9A ''Noam Elimelech text on Hebrew Wikisource'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080514125433/http://www.targum.com/files/zweckersampler.pdf ''Noam Elimelech in English samples'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213206/http://www.targum.com/files/zweckerprayer.pdf ''Tefilah Kodem HaTefillah'']\n* [http://770live.com/En770/nigunim/nigunPlay.asp?nigunId=Dovid_Hurwitz/212.rm&gif=212 A Hassidic Tune attributed to Rabbi Elimelech of Lizensk]\n* [http://www.chassidusonline.com/noam-elimelech-article-mishpacha.pdf ''Rebbe Elimelech Stories'']\n* [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/3933 ''Ohel Elimelech Hebrew Tales about Rebbe Elimelech'']\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-rel|jw}}\n{{Succession box| before= [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Magid of Mezritsh]] | title=Hasidic Rebbes| years=1772\u20131786 | after=[[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]], Rabbi [[Yisroel Hopsztajn|Yisroel of Kozhnitz]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elimelech Of Lezhinsk}}\n[[Category:1717 births]]\n[[Category:1787 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rebbes]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe]]\n[[Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe)]]\n[[Category:Polish Orthodox rabbis]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rebbe\n| title           = Elimelech of Lezajsk\n| image           = Ohel Le\u017cajsk 01.jpg\n| caption         = [[kever (grave)]] of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk\n| birth_name       = Elimelech Weisblum\n| main_work       = Noam Elimelech\n| predecessor     = [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]]\n| successor       = [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]], [[Yisroel Hopsztajn|Yisroel of Kozhnitz]]\n| spouse = Shprintza,  Gittel\n| children          = Rabbi Elazar, Rabbi Eliezer Lipa, Reb Yaakov, Mirish, Esther - Ethel\n\n| dynasty     = Lizhensk\n| father          = Eliezer Lipman\n| mother          = Mirel dit Mirish\n| birth_date      = 1717\n| birth_place     = [[Tykocin]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]]\n| death_date      = March 11, 1787\n| death_place     = [[Le\u017cajsk]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]\n| place of burial = Le\u017cajsk, [[Poland]]\n|\n}}\n\n'''Elimelech Weisblum of Lizhensk''' (1717\u2013March 11, 1787<ref>See image of gravestone at e.g. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fTh0xyZ1FRQ/R-rEbh5TgVI/AAAAAAAABA4/h3023o7lqXI/s400/elimelech.jpg which gives the year as \u05ea' \u05e0' \u05e6' \u05d1' \u05d4' which is 547, short for the Jewish year 5,547, or 1787.</ref>) was a [[rabbi]] and one of the great founding [[Rebbe]]s of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic movement]]. He was known after his hometown, [[Le\u017cajsk]] ({{lang-yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d6\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7|translit=Lizhensk}}) near [[Rzesz\u00f3w]] in [[Poland]]. He was part of the inner \"Chevraya Kadisha\" (Holy Society) school of the [[Maggid]] Rebbe [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch]] (second leader of the Hasidic movement), who became the decentralised, third generation leadership after the passing of Rebbe Dov Ber in 1772. Their dissemination to new areas of [[Eastern Europe]] led the movement's rapid revivalist expansion.\n\nRebbi Elimelech authored the classic [[Hasidic philosophy|work]] ''Noam Elimelech''. It developed the Hasidic theory of the [[Tzaddik]] into the full doctrine of \"''Practical/Popular Tzaddikism''\". This shaped the social role of [[Ayin and Yesh|mystical]] [[Rebbe|leadership]], characteristic of the \"''Mainstream Hasidic''\" path. He was the founder of Hasidism in [[Poland]]-[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and numerous leaders and [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] emerged from his disciples in the early 19th century, including the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], the [[Maggid of Koznitz]] and [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], one of the three \"Fathers of Polish Hasidism\". Because of this, Rebbi Elimelech is venerated by the \"Mainstream\" path in Hasidism, predominant especially in Poland, who descend from his influence.\n\n==Biography==\nRebbe Elimelech was born in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (Central Europe), which was located in the Kingdom of Poland that was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He died in [[Le\u017cajsk]] on the 21st of [[Adar]]. He was known as a [[Tzadik]] who devoted his life to studying and teaching the [[Torah]], as well as encouraging people to draw closer in return to God.\n\n===The brothers Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya===\nRebbe Elimelech was a prominent student of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], and was brought under his tutelage by his brother the famous Rebbe Reb [[Meshulam Zushya of Anipoli]]. Both brothers are central figures in Hasidic tradition and Reb Zushya is especially beloved for his sincerity and fervour. The two offered a contrast in the model of the Hasidic [[Rebbe]], with Elimelech the ascetic scholar, and Zushya giving the impression of the charismatic \"saintly simpleton\", although he too was well versed in [[Hasidic philosophy]]. Of all the students in the Maggid's \"Holy Society\" it is told that only Zushya could contain his [[dveikus]] (fervour) and remain in the room as the Maggid revealed fiery new teachings. The other students would faint or run out of the room in ecstasy.<ref>Cited in ''The Great Maggid'' by [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]]. Kehot Publications</ref> The two brothers would travel together in mystical exile of [[Teshuvah|repentance]] to atone on behalf of the whole Jewish people and the exile of the [[Shechinah]] (Divine Presence). Famous Hasidic tales are told of their encounters.\n<blockquote>\nOn one occasion, Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya were staying at an inn. Each night, gentile peasants would enter their room and jestingly beat the one who lay nearest the fireside, Reb Zushya. One night, Rabbi Elimelech offered to change places with his brother so that he could take the beatings instead. Suggesting that Reb Zushya had suffered enough of this \"Divine admonishment\", the agreement was made and Rabbi Elimelech lay next to the fire instead. That night, the common gentiles again entered to begin their jest. This time, however, one of them said that the one by the fire had taken his fair share of the treatment, and now it would be better to jest with the other one! Again Reb Zushya took the beatings. Afterwards, he told his brother that whatever is decided in Heaven transpires!\n</blockquote>\n\n===Hasidic Leadership===\nAfter the death of the [[Dovber of Mezeritch|Maggid of Mezeritch]], the Hasidic movement avoided one centralised leader, as had characterised it under the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and the Maggid. Instead the great leadership of students of the Maggid dispersed across Eastern Europe, from Poland to Russia, taking with them their different interpretations of Hasidism. Nonetheless, in this third generation, Rabbi Elimelech was considered by most of the Maggid's students and followers as his successor. He began the dissemination of Hasidism in Poland, which subsequently increased to a much greater extent under his foremost disciple, the [[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]].\n\nMany of Rebbe Elimelech's students (talmidim) went on to be Rebbes in their own right. The most famous are the [[Chozeh of Lublin]], Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel of Rimanov]], the [[Kozhnitzer Maggid]], the [[Apter Rov]] and Rabbi [[Kalonymus Kalman Epstein|Kalonymus Kalman Halevi Epstein]], author of ''Maor Vashemesh''.\n\nTo this day his grave in [[Le\u017cajsk]], [[Poland]], is visited by thousands of those faithful to Hasidism, particularly on the anniversary of his death, the 21st of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]] (in leap years, commemorated twice, in Adar I and Adar II).<ref>David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson \u2018\u2019Pilgrimage and the Jews\u2019\u2019 (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006), 112-115.</ref> In 2012, approximately 6,000 pilgrims <ref>http://www.rp.pl/artykul/10,838345-Chasydzi-pielgrzymuja-do-grobu-cadyka.html</ref> came to visit the site on the anniversary coming from Israel, Ukraine, Hungary, Germany, Holland, France, Great Britain, Canada and the USA.<ref>http://www.nowiny24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120315/LEZAJSK/120319740</ref> In most Chasidic [[minyan]]im, [[Tachanun]] is omitted on the Noam Elimelech's [[Bereavement in Judaism#Annual remembrances|Yartzeit]].<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://woodstocktom.com/2009/12/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-tachanun/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718081857/http://woodstocktom.com/2009/12/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-tachanun/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\nIt is said that when Rebbe Elimelech came before the heavenly tribunal, he stated that \"unfortunately, I didn't pray or learn Torah\", the judge then proclaimed \"if so then you have to be taken to hell!\", the angels carried Rebbe Elimelech to what he thought was [[Hell]] but was really [[Heaven]], Rebbe Elimelech then said \"How merciful is our [[Father in heaven]], He made hell so good, just imagine what heaven must be like!\"\n\n==Noam Elimelech==\nAs is common amongst great Rabbis, he is most commonly known by the name of his popular book ''Noam Elimelech'', a commentary on the Torah. This book is one of the principal works of [[Hasidism]]. The sefer was called ''Sefer Shel Tzadikim'', (a Book for the Righteous) by Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (founder of the [[Lubavitch]] dynasty).\n\nThe book has asterisks or stars placed in seemingly random places over words.  Tradition has it that these stars have some meaning. In ''Devarim Areivim'' (another [[Hasidic]] classic), the author, Rabbi Dov Ehrmann, wrote: \"In the first edition of the sefer, there are in many places small stars which allude to some secret meaning\". The [[Klausenberg (Hasidic dynasty)|Klausenberger]] [[Rebbe]] once said that the stars in the heavens are a commentary to the stars in the book ''Noam Elimelech''. As such, all subsequent printings have included these stars.\n\nRabbi Elimelech also wrote ''Tzetl Koton'', a seventeen-point program on how to be a good Jew, and ''Hanhagos HaAdam'', a list of [[Minhag|customs]] for all pious Jews to follow.\n\n===Three Hasidic mystical paths===\n[[Image:Lizhenskgrave.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] Rebbe of America praying in the [[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Rabbi Elimelech. His grave is venerated in pilgrimage by \"Mainstream\"-Polish [[Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]] and their followers, as their spiritual path in Hasidism descends from his influence]]\nA Hasidic aphorism<ref>In ''Transforming Darkness into Light: Kabbalah and Psychology'' (Teachings of Kabbalah Series), [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]], Gal Einai Pub.</ref> describes three paths of mysticism in the Hasidic movement, formed by three works of Hasidic thought. [[Nachman of Breslov]]'s ''Likkutei Moharan'' is described as the Hasidic book of the great, giving hope and encouragement to those trapped in problems, through Rabbi Nachman's innovative creativity and the personal [[Hitbodedut|articulation]] of one's problems to God. [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]]'s ''[[Tanya]]'' is subtitled the Hasidic book for the intermediate person, who has ease to intellectually [[Hisbonenus|contemplate]] and internalise [[Hasidic thought]], free from distracting troubles. In this [[Habad]] path, the Tzadik's primary role is to teach the esoteric dimension of Hasidism in intellectual understanding. ''Noam Elimelech'' is seen as the formative book of the righteous [[Tzadik]]. It instructs select people of spiritual ability how to become Hasidic mystical leaders, while advocating attachment to the Tzadik by the common folk. Because of this, ''Noam Elimelech'' influenced the Mainstream Hasidic proliferation of the Tzadik, who embodies and channels the [[Ayin and Yesh|Ayin-Yesh]] Divine flow of blessing to this world. The [[Chozeh of Lublin]] (1745-1815) developed further the dynamics of this process. Meanwhile, the mid-19th century [[Simcha Bunim of Peshischa|Peshischa]]-[[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk|Kotzk]] spiritual development in Hasidism and its influence, is excluded from this description. It left aside ''Tzaddikism'' and mystical focus in favour of personal autonomy, introspection and Rabbinic [[Torah study]] in the spirit of Hasidic spiritual inwardness. The ''Yid HaKodosh'' of [[Przysucha]] in Poland began this trend when he broke away from the Chozeh of Lublin's Tzadik focused spiritual path.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://lizensk.com ''Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk'' ]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080612150258/http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/books/html/bk1194026.htm ''Digitized 1st Edition Hebrew Noam Elimelech'']\n* [https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9A ''Noam Elimelech text on Hebrew Wikisource'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080514125433/http://www.targum.com/files/zweckersampler.pdf ''Noam Elimelech in English samples'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213206/http://www.targum.com/files/zweckerprayer.pdf ''Tefilah Kodem HaTefillah'']\n* [http://770live.com/En770/nigunim/nigunPlay.asp?nigunId=Dovid_Hurwitz/212.rm&gif=212 A Hassidic Tune attributed to Rabbi Elimelech of Lizensk]\n* [http://www.chassidusonline.com/noam-elimelech-article-mishpacha.pdf ''Rebbe Elimelech Stories'']\n* [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/3933 ''Ohel Elimelech Hebrew Tales about Rebbe Elimelech'']\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-rel|jw}}\n{{Succession box| before= [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Magid of Mezritsh]] | title=Hasidic Rebbes| years=1772\u20131786 | after=[[Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin|Chozeh of Lublin]], Rabbi [[Yisroel Hopsztajn|Yisroel of Kozhnitz]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elimelech Of Lezhinsk}}\n[[Category:1717 births]]\n[[Category:1787 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rebbes]]\n[[Category:Hasidic rabbis in Europe]]\n[[Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe)]]\n[[Category:Polish Orthodox rabbis]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "no link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimelech_of_Lizhensk"}

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for a convict's remaining natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Earlier on in 1993, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for a convict's remaining natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

On 7 September that year, Fabian was arrested, followed by Ellarry the next day. In September 2011, Fabian was found guilty of murder and given the mandatory death sentence. However, in 2012, the mandatory death penalty law was revised. It reduces the sentence of death, for those convicted of drug trafficking or murder, to life imprisonment if conditions were met.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|title=Murderer fails to escape the gallows: 6 other cases involving the revised death penalty laws|last=Abu Baker|first=Jalelah|date=16 January 2015|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321155910/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/murderer-fails-to-escape-the-gallows-6-other-cases-involving-the-revised|archive-date=21 March 2018|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref> This enabled Fabian to undergo a retrial and on 17 July 2013, he became the first person to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment under the revised death penalty.
