The lunar phases gradually change over the period of a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] (about 29.53 days), as the [[orbit]]al positions of the Moon around Earth and of Earth around the [[Sun]] shift.\n\nThe Moon's rotation is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] by Earth's [[gravity]]; therefore, most of the same lunar side always faces Earth. This [[near side of the Moon|near side]] is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]]. Thus, the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% (at [[new moon]]) to 100% (at [[full moon]]). The [[terminator (solar)#Lunar terminator|lunar terminator]] is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres.\n\nEach of the four \"intermediate\" lunar phases (see below) is around 7.4 [[day]]s, but this [[orbital eccentricity|varies slightly]] due to the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some [[lunar craters|craters]] near the lunar poles, such as [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|Shoemaker]], all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of [[daylight]], followed by 14.77 days of \"[[night]]\". (The [[far side of the Moon|side of the Moon]] facing away from Earth is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon\", although that is a [[misnomer]]).\n\n<br />\n\n==Phases of the Moon==\n{{redirect|Waxing gibbous|the album|Waxing Gibbous}}\n[[File:Moon phases en.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The phases of the Moon as viewed looking southward from the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

These are the instances when the Moon's [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] and the Sun's [[ecliptic]] longitude differ by 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0, respectively.{{efn|Strictly, the quarter phases happen when the observer\u2013Moon\u2013Sun angle is 90\u00b0, also known as [[quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]]. This is not exactly the same as having the Sun\u2013observer\u2013Moon angle a right-angle, but the difference is very slight.}} Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on Earth. During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon's apparent shape is either [[crescent]] or [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]]. These shapes, and the periods when the Moon shows them, are called the ''intermediate phases'' and last one-quarter of a [[synodic month]], or 7.38 days, on average. However, their durations [[orbital eccentricity|vary slightly]] because the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] is rather [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]], so the satellite's [[orbital speed]] is not constant. The descriptor ''waxing'' is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent shape is thickening, from new to full moon, and ''waning'' when the shape is thinning.\n\nThe eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names, in sequential order:\n\n<center>\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Principal and intermediate phases of the Moon\n!

The camera is locked to the Moon as Earth rapidly rotates in the foreground.]]\n\nNon-Western cultures may use a different number of lunar phases; for example, traditional [[Hawaiian culture]] has a total of 30 phases (one per day).<ref>{{cite web |title=Hawaiian Moon Names |work=Imiloa, Hilo Attractions |url=http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57/ |access-date=2013-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102085746/http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57 |archive-date=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Waxing and waning===\n[[File:Moon Phase Diagram for Simple English Wikipedia.GIF|thumb|Diagram of the Moon's phases: The Earth is at the center of the diagram and the Moon is shown orbiting.]]\nWhen the Sun and Moon are [[conjunction (astronomy)|aligned on the same side]] of the Earth, the Moon is \"new\", and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the Moon ''waxes'' (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]] moon, and full moon. The Moon is then said to ''wane'' as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon, and back to new moon. The terms ''old moon'' and ''new moon'' are not interchangeable. The \"old moon\" is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the Sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Astronomy Lesson 7 - The Phases of the Moon |url=http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/moon2.html |website=Synapses.co.uk |accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref> ''Half moon'' is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term ''quarter'' refers to the extent of the Moon's cycle around the Earth, not its shape.\n\nWhen an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an [[ellipse]] and circle (in which the ellipse's [[major axis]] coincides with the circle's diameter). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards),<ref>Origin: 1350\u20131400; Middle English < Latin ''gibb\u014dsus''  humped, equivalent to ''gibb'' \"(a) hump\" + ''-\u014dsus'' \"-ous\"; {{cite web |title=Gibbous |work=[[Dictionary.com]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gibbous}}</ref> whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a [[crescent]]. When a crescent moon occurs, the phenomenon of [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=CNN |first1=Leah Asmelash and David Allan |title=A black moon is coming on July 31. Here's what that means |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/us/black-moon-trnd-scn/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref>\n\n===Orientation by latitude===\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if the left (east) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thickening, and the Moon is described as [[wikt:wax|waxing]] (shifting toward full moon). If the right (west) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thinning, and the Moon is described as waning (past full and shifting toward new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is the part that is always waxing. (That is, if the right side is dark, the Moon is becoming darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is getting brighter.)\n\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted, or rotated 180\u00b0, to that of the Northern and to all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane.\n\nCloser to the [[Equator]], the [[lunar terminator]] will appear horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at [[middle latitude|middle]] or [[polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]], observers moving towards the [[tropics]] from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article.\n\nThe lunar crescent can open upward or downward, with the \"horns\" of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, [[wet moon|the crescent opens upward]]. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning.\n\n===Earthshine===\n[[File:Lumiere cendr\u00e9e (12273290216).jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[exposure (photography)|overexposed]] photograph of a crescent Moon reveals earthshine and stars.]]\n{{main|Earthlight (astronomy)}}\n\nWhen the Moon as seen from Earth is a thin [[crescent]], Earth as viewed from the Moon is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] and sometimes picturesquely described as \"the old moon in the new moon's arms\" or \"the new moon in the old moon's arms\".\n\n==Calendar==\n{{main|Lunar calendar}}\n[[File:Moon phase calendar May2005.jpg|thumb|left|May\u2013June 2005 calendar of lunar phases]]\n\nThe [[Gregorian calendar]] month, which is {{frac|12}} of a [[tropical year]], is about 30.44 days, while the cycle of lunar phases (the Moon's [[Orbital period#Synodic period|synodic period]]) repeats every [[Lunar month#Synodic month|29.53 days]] on average. Therefore, the timing of the lunar phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month. (A [[lunar year]] lasts about 354 days.)\n\nPhotographing the Moon's phase every day for a month (starting in the evening after [[sunset]], and repeating roughly 24 hours and 50 minutes later, and ending in the morning before [[sunrise]]) and arranging the series of photos on a calendar would create a [[composite image]] like the example calendar (May 8 &ndash; June 6, 2005) shown on the left. May 20 is blank because a picture would be taken before midnight on May 19 and the next after midnight on May 21.\n\nSimilarly, on a calendar listing moonrise or moonset times, some days will appear to be skipped. When moonrise precedes [[midnight]] one night, the next moonrise will follow midnight on the next night (so too with moonset). The \"skipped day\" is just a feature of the Moon's [[prograde motion|eastward movement]] in relation to the Sun, which at most latitudes, causes the Moon to rise later each day. The Moon follows a predictable orbit every month.\n\n==Calculating phase==\n[[File:BethinAZ - 10-13.002 (by).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A crescent Moon over [[Kingman, Arizona]]]]\n\nEach of the four intermediate phases lasts approximately seven days (7.38 days on average), but varies slightly due to lunar [[apogee]] and [[perigee]].\n\nThe number of days counted from the time of the [[new moon]] is the Moon's \"age\". Each complete cycle of phases is called a \"[[lunation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.php |title=Phases of the Moon and Percent of the Moon Illuminated |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |language=en |access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThe approximate age of the Moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this [[modulo operation|modulo]] 29.530588853 (the length of a [[synodic month]]). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the [[Julian day|Julian day number]] of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly [[circular orbit]] and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon occurred and therefore may be incorrect by several hours. (It also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date). It is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing lunar phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation.\n\n== Effect of [[parallax]] ==\nThe [[Earth]] subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about 2 degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the [[West|western horizon]]. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or 4 hours. But in reality, the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the [[East|eastern horizon]] at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a [[month]]. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. However, it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.\n\n== Misconceptions ==\n[[File:Orbit of the Moon in 2013.ogv|right|thumb|The ''lunar phase'' depends on the Moon's position in orbit around the Earth and the Earth's position in orbit around the sun. This animation (''not to scale'') looks down on Earth from the north pole of the ecliptic.]]\n\nIt might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a [[solar eclipse]], but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the [[Earth's shadow]] falls on the Moon, causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed ''every'' month because the plane of the [[Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is tilted by about 5\u00b0 with respect to the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun (the plane of the [[ecliptic]]). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an [[eclipse]] can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth's orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon's orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of [[lunar node|its nodes]]). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Blue moon]]\n* [[Lunar effect]]\n* [[Lunation]]\n* [[Observing the Moon]]\n* [[Planetary phase]]\n* [[Planetshine#Earthshine|Planetshine]]\n* [[Tide]]s\n* [[Week]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buick|first1=Tony |last2=Pugh|first2=Philip |title=How to Photograph the Moon and Planets with Your Digital Camera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4OHwWR9nFMC&pg=PA70|date= 2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5828-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Kelley|first1=David H. |last2=Milone|first2=Eugene F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC|year=2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-7624-6|edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kutner|first=Marc L. |title=Astronomy: A Physical Perspective|url=https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn/page/435 435]|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52927-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lynch|first=Mike |title=Texas Starwatch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3jR5NRgUy0C&pg=PA107+|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61060-511-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Naylor|first=John |title=Out of the Blue: A 24-Hour Skywatcher's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQOJGerV2IcC&pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80925-2}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L.

The lunar phases gradually change over the period of a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] (about 29.53 days), as the [[orbit]]al positions of the Moon around Earth and of Earth around the [[Sun]] shift.\n\nThe Moon's rotation is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] by Earth's [[gravity]]; therefore, most of the same lunar side always faces Earth. This [[near side of the Moon|near side]] is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]]. Thus, the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% (at [[new moon]]) to 100% (at [[full moon]]). The [[terminator (solar)#Lunar terminator|lunar terminator]] is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres.\n\nEach of the four \"intermediate\" lunar phases (see below) is around 7.4 [[day]]s, but this [[orbital eccentricity|varies slightly]] due to the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some [[lunar craters|craters]] near the lunar poles, such as [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|Shoemaker]], all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of [[daylight]], followed by 14.77 days of \"[[night]]\". (The [[far side of the Moon|side of the Moon]] facing away from Earth is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon\", although that is a [[misnomer]]).\n\n<br />\n\n==Phases of the Moon==\n{{redirect|Waxing gibbous|the album|Waxing Gibbous}}\n[[File:Moon phases en.jpg|thumb|center|800px|The phases of the Moon as viewed looking southward from the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

These are the instances when the Moon's [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] and the Sun's [[ecliptic]] longitude differ by 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0, respectively.{{efn|Strictly, the quarter phases happen when the observer\u2013Moon\u2013Sun angle is 90\u00b0, also known as [[quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]].

During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon's apparent shape is either [[crescent]] or [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]]. These shapes, and the periods when the Moon shows them, are called the ''intermediate phases'' and last one-quarter of a [[synodic month]], or 7.38 days, on average. However, their durations [[orbital eccentricity|vary slightly]] because the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] is rather [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]], so the satellite's [[orbital speed]] is not constant. The descriptor ''waxing'' is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent shape is thickening, from new to full moon, and ''waning'' when the shape is thinning.\n\nThe eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names, in sequential order:\n\n<center>\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Principal and intermediate phases of the Moon\n!

The camera is locked to the Moon as Earth rapidly rotates in the foreground.]]\n\nNon-Western cultures may use a different number of lunar phases; for example, traditional [[Hawaiian culture]] has a total of 30 phases (one per day).<ref>{{cite web |title=Hawaiian Moon Names |work=Imiloa, Hilo Attractions |url=http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57/ |access-date=2013-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102085746/http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57 |archive-date=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Waxing and waning===\n[[File:Moon Phase Diagram for Simple English Wikipedia.GIF|thumb|Diagram of the Moon's phases: The Earth is at the center of the diagram and the Moon is shown orbiting.]]\nWhen the Sun and Moon are [[conjunction (astronomy)|aligned on the same side]] of the Earth, the Moon is \"new\", and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the Moon ''waxes'' (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]] moon, and full moon. The Moon is then said to ''wane'' as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon, and back to new moon. The terms ''old moon'' and ''new moon'' are not interchangeable. The \"old moon\" is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the Sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again.<ref>{{cite web |title=Free Astronomy Lesson 7 - The Phases of the Moon |url=http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/moon2.html |website=Synapses.co.uk |accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref> ''Half moon'' is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term ''quarter'' refers to the extent of the Moon's cycle around the Earth, not its shape.\n\nWhen an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an [[ellipse]] and circle (in which the ellipse's [[major axis]] coincides with the circle's diameter). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards),<ref>Origin: 1350\u20131400; Middle English < Latin ''gibb\u014dsus''  humped, equivalent to ''gibb'' \"(a) hump\" + ''-\u014dsus'' \"-ous\"; {{cite web |title=Gibbous |work=[[Dictionary.com]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gibbous}}</ref> whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a [[crescent]]. When a crescent moon occurs, the phenomenon of [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=CNN |first1=Leah Asmelash and David Allan |title=A black moon is coming on July 31. Here's what that means |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/us/black-moon-trnd-scn/index.html |website=CNN}}</ref>\n\n===Orientation by latitude===\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if the left (east) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thickening, and the Moon is described as [[wikt:wax|waxing]] (shifting toward full moon). If the right (west) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thinning, and the Moon is described as waning (past full and shifting toward new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is the part that is always waxing. (That is, if the right side is dark, the Moon is becoming darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is getting brighter.)\n\nIn the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted, or rotated 180\u00b0, to that of the Northern and to all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane.\n\nCloser to the [[Equator]], the [[lunar terminator]] will appear horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at [[middle latitude|middle]] or [[polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]], observers moving towards the [[tropics]] from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article.\n\nThe lunar crescent can open upward or downward, with the \"horns\" of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, [[wet moon|the crescent opens upward]]. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning.\n\n===Earthshine===\n[[File:Lumiere cendr\u00e9e (12273290216).jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[exposure (photography)|overexposed]] photograph of a crescent Moon reveals earthshine and stars.]]\n{{main|Earthlight (astronomy)}}\n\nWhen the Moon as seen from Earth is a thin [[crescent]], Earth as viewed from the Moon is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] and sometimes picturesquely described as \"the old moon in the new moon's arms\" or \"the new moon in the old moon's arms\".\n\n==Calendar==\n{{main|Lunar calendar}}\n[[File:Moon phase calendar May2005.jpg|thumb|left|May\u2013June 2005 calendar of lunar phases]]\n\nThe [[Gregorian calendar]] month, which is {{frac|12}} of a [[tropical year]], is about 30.44 days, while the cycle of lunar phases (the Moon's [[Orbital period#Synodic period|synodic period]]) repeats every [[Lunar month#Synodic month|29.53 days]] on average. Therefore, the timing of the lunar phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month. (A [[lunar year]] lasts about 354 days.)\n\nPhotographing the Moon's phase every day for a month (starting in the evening after [[sunset]], and repeating roughly 24 hours and 50 minutes later, and ending in the morning before [[sunrise]]) and arranging the series of photos on a calendar would create a [[composite image]] like the example calendar (May 8 &ndash; June 6, 2005) shown on the left. May 20 is blank because a picture would be taken before midnight on May 19 and the next after midnight on May 21.\n\nSimilarly, on a calendar listing moonrise or moonset times, some days will appear to be skipped. When moonrise precedes [[midnight]] one night, the next moonrise will follow midnight on the next night (so too with moonset). The \"skipped day\" is just a feature of the Moon's [[prograde motion|eastward movement]] in relation to the Sun, which at most latitudes, causes the Moon to rise later each day. The Moon follows a predictable orbit every month.\n\n==Calculating phase==\n[[File:BethinAZ - 10-13.002 (by).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A crescent Moon over [[Kingman, Arizona]]]]\n\nEach of the four intermediate phases lasts approximately seven days (7.38 days on average), but varies slightly due to lunar [[apogee]] and [[perigee]].\n\nThe number of days counted from the time of the [[new moon]] is the Moon's \"age\". Each complete cycle of phases is called a \"[[lunation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.php |title=Phases of the Moon and Percent of the Moon Illuminated |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |language=en |access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThe approximate age of the Moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this [[modulo operation|modulo]] 29.530588853 (the length of a [[synodic month]]). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the [[Julian day|Julian day number]] of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly [[circular orbit]] and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon occurred and therefore may be incorrect by several hours. (It also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date). It is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing lunar phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation.\n\n== Effect of [[parallax]] ==\nThe [[Earth]] subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about 2 degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the [[West|western horizon]]. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or 4 hours. But in reality, the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the [[East|eastern horizon]] at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a [[month]]. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. However, it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.\n\n== Misconceptions ==\n[[File:Orbit of the Moon in 2013.ogv|right|thumb|The ''lunar phase'' depends on the Moon's position in orbit around the Earth and the Earth's position in orbit around the sun. This animation (''not to scale'') looks down on Earth from the north pole of the ecliptic.]]\n\nIt might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a [[solar eclipse]], but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the [[Earth's shadow]] falls on the Moon, causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed ''every'' month because the plane of the [[Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is tilted by about 5\u00b0 with respect to the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun (the plane of the [[ecliptic]]). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an [[eclipse]] can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth's orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon's orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of [[lunar node|its nodes]]). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Blue moon]]\n* [[Lunar effect]]\n* [[Lunation]]\n* [[Observing the Moon]]\n* [[Planetary phase]]\n* [[Planetshine#Earthshine|Planetshine]]\n* [[Tide]]s\n* [[Week]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buick|first1=Tony |last2=Pugh|first2=Philip |title=How to Photograph the Moon and Planets with Your Digital Camera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4OHwWR9nFMC&pg=PA70|date= 2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5828-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Kelley|first1=David H. |last2=Milone|first2=Eugene F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC|year=2011|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-7624-6|edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kutner|first=Marc L. |title=Astronomy: A Physical Perspective|url=https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/astronomyphysica00kutn/page/435 435]|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52927-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lynch|first=Mike |title=Texas Starwatch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3jR5NRgUy0C&pg=PA107+|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-1-61060-511-3}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Naylor|first=John |title=Out of the Blue: A 24-Hour Skywatcher's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQOJGerV2IcC&pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80925-2}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L.

The club was founded in 1964 as a merger between two local clubs and was promoted to the Danish top-flight football league in 1981.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby IF has won ten [[Danish football champions|Danish Championships]] and seven [[Danish Cup]]s. Br\u00f8ndby's most successful period was from 1985 to 2005 when, in twenty years, they won all of their ten league titles. In [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1991]], Br\u00f8ndby reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] and became the first and only Danish club to ever reach a European semi-final.\n\nSince the founding of fellow [[Copenhagen]] club [[F.C. Copenhagen]] in 1992 (a merger between [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] and [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]), they have had a fierce rivalry; matches between the two clubs are referred to as the [[Copenhagen Derby]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1964&ndash;1977)===\n[[File:Brondby_won_cup.jpg|thumb]]\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was formed on 3 December 1964 following a merger between two local rivals \u2013 '''Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF''' and '''[[:da:Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF|Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF]]'''. The merger was to be completed as a prerequisite for the construction of a new stadium by [[Br\u00f8ndby Municipality]].<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book|url=|title=Br\u00f8ndby IF : drengene fra Vestegnen|date=2011|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=978-87-02-10258-1|editor-last=Brock|editor-first=Jeppe Laursen}}</ref> Br\u00f8ndby IF spent its inaugural season as an amateur club in the 6th tier of the 11 Danish leagues, the Serie 1, where they finished their two first seasons in fourth place. Among the players of the early years was team captain [[Per Bjerregaard]], a doctor who had moved to Copenhagen from [[Randers]] in [[Jutland]], and Hans Gregersen, who was the mascot of the team until his death by [[syphilis]] in 1967. In 1967, the club hired coach [[Leif Andersen]] who instantly secured promotion to ''Sj\u00e6llandsserien'' (the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] series). After a few mediocre years, a new coach, John Sinding, was brought in, and the club won promotion to ''Danmarksserien'' (the Denmark series).\n\nIn 1973, Per Bjerregaard stopped his active career at 27 years of age and became chairman of Br\u00f8ndby; his first action was to sack head coach Sinding. In his place, Br\u00f8ndby hired former professional and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] player [[Finn Laudrup]], who took over as head coach while he still took actively part in the matches as a player. Laudrup joined his brother-in-law [[Ebbe Skovdahl]] in the Br\u00f8ndby team, and he brought his two young sons [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] and [[Michael Laudrup]] with him to the club. Under Finn Laudrup's influence, the club's playing style was changed to a more attacking strategy, even though Laudrup decided to fully concentrate his efforts as a player after only a year. After winning promotion in 1974, Laudrup left Br\u00f8ndby in the 3rd Division in 1976 to play for [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub|KB]] in the Danish top-flight league (then named the 1st Division) and a year later Michael Laudrup, the brightest talent in Danish football, followed.\n\n===Professional football (1977&ndash;1987)===\nIn 1977, Br\u00f8ndby moved up into the 2nd Division, and were one of the clubs who quickly adapted to the new times of paid football in the best Danish leagues in 1978. Per Bjerregaard persuaded Finn Laudrup into returning to Br\u00f8ndby in 1981 on a professional contract, and following a season of 85 goals in 30 matches, Br\u00f8ndby won promotion to the top-flight 1st Division under coach [[Tom K\u00f8hlert]]. Finn Laudrup subsequently ended his career at age 36, but in his place Michael Laudrup returned for the [[1982 in Danish football|1982 season]], being one of ten players leaving KB that year.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby won their 1st Division debut match 7\u20131 over fellow [[promotion (sports)|promoted]] team [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] in a match which featured two goals from Michael Laudrup. He was subsequently called up for the Denmark national team, and on 15 June 1982 he became the first Br\u00f8ndby player to win a [[cap (football)|cap]] for the national team. Br\u00f8ndby finished their first 1st Division season in fourth place with Laudrup the league's third top goal scorer with 15 goals, earning him the [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. In 1983, Laudrup was sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the then-biggest transfer deal in Denmark, giving Br\u00f8ndby the economic foundation to expand further.\n\nAfter four years in the top division, Br\u00f8ndby won their first Danish championship in [[Danish 1st Division 1985|1985]] and played its first European match when the club beat [[Hungary|Hungarian]] champions [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] 4\u20131 in the 1986 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. In 1986, Br\u00f8ndby became the first Danish club of fully professionals when ten players were signed full-time, and the club was introduced at the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] in 1987.\n\n===European success (1987&ndash;1992)===\nThroughout the second half of the 1980s, the team dominated the league and did not finish lower than second place until 1992. The team was built around talented Danish players, and from 1987 to 1991 players from Br\u00f8ndby won the Danish Player of the Year award every year. The recipients formed the backbone of the Denmark national team which later won [[UEFA Euro 1992]], and was the first goalscorer in the 2\u20130 Euro 1992 final win [[John Jensen|John \"Faxe\" Jensen]] (1987), national team captain [[Lars Olsen]] (1988), the World's Best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]] 1992 and 1993 award winner [[Peter Schmeichel]] (1989), four-time Danish Player of the Year award winner Brian Laudrup (1990) and the second goalscorer of the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|Euro 1992 final]] [[Kim Vilfort]] (1991). The club became used to winning the national title and turned its attention towards European success.\n\nIn 1990, Br\u00f8ndby hired former national team captain [[Morten Olsen]] as coach, and under his reign, the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]] became the high point in the short history of the club. Especially the meriting wins over German sides [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], and Russian club [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] saw the many Danish profiles shine, and the club was minutes from qualifying for the final match of the tournament. In the 88th minute of the semi-final, however, a [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] goal denied Br\u00f8ndby a trip to the UEFA Cup final in favour of [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Following the impressive European display by the comparatively small club, important members of the team, including Lars Olsen, top scoring [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Bent Christensen Arens\u00f8e|Bent \"Turbo\" Christensen]] and star goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, left the club.\n\nThe following year, 1992, was the worst year in the club's history as the intended takeover of the Danish bank [[Interbank]] went awry. It was expected that European Cup success would boost the Br\u00f8ndby stock value in order to finance the buy, but as the club was beaten by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] qualification, the stocks never reached the value necessary to finalize the deal. It had been arranged for financial backers Hafnia Insurance Company to step in and take over the buy in case Br\u00f8ndby could not finance it, but as Hafnia went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], Br\u00f8ndby were forced to buy Interbank and financial collapse was imminent as club debts amassed to 400 million [[Danish krone|DKK]].<ref>{{in lang|da}} Henrik H. Brandt, \"Br\u00f8ndby IF: Mirakelkuren\", ''[[Jyllands-Posten]] article'', 1 June 1997</ref> A long-term rescue plan was initiated to save the club, but these events influenced the performance of the team and the championship, now called the Danish Superliga, was not won again until [[1995\u201396 Danish Superliga|1996]].\n\n===Rebuilding (1992&ndash;2002)===\nThe rebuilding of the team was led by head coach [[Ebbe Skovdahl]], who deployed the team in a [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4-4-2 formation]]. The return to the club of Euro 1992 veterans John Jensen and captain Lars Olsen combined with the emergence of goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and striker [[Ebbe Sand]] got the club back on its feet. The rebuilding culminated in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup]] elimination of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], though Roma once again knocked Br\u00f8ndby out. Including that year, Br\u00f8ndby won three Danish championships in a row, and [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|the next year's UEFA Cup]] saw one of the biggest upsets in Br\u00f8ndby history, as a 3\u20131 home defeat to [[Karlsruher SC]] was changed to an aggregate win when Br\u00f8ndby beat the team of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] winner [[Thomas H\u00e4\u00dfler]] 5\u20130 away in Germany. Most importantly for the club's economy, Br\u00f8ndby qualified for the new format of the European Cup, rebranded as the UEFA Champions League.<ref name=\"First CL qualification\">\n\nDanish club [[AaB Fodbold|Aalborg BK]] played in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League|1995\u201396 Champions League]] tournament as a result of the bribing scandal of Dynamo Kyiv, thus they did not qualify through the qualification rounds.</ref> The Champions League qualification meant six guaranteed matches in a [[Round-robin tournament|group stage]] with three of the biggest teams of Europe, and when they were paired with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and later finalists [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Br\u00f8ndby faced very economically attractive matches. Despite winning 2\u20131 over Bayern in the first match of the group stage, Br\u00f8ndby conceded 18 goals in 6 matches and were eliminated with a single win to their name.\n\nSkovdahl decided to take a stab at coaching at Scottish club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and Br\u00f8ndby took a more [[Scandinavia]]n approach, in search of stable success in the European competitions with Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] the role model.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Kurt Lassen and Thorsten Dam, \"Br\u00f8ndby enig med Hareide\", ''[[Berlingske Tidende]] article'', 17 April 1999</ref> The club hired Norwegian manager [[\u00c5ge Hareide]] in 2000, who proclaimed a shift in line-up to a more attacking [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133 system]]. With Hareide came a handful of Scandinavian players of whom especially [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]] player [[Mattias Jonson]] became a fan favourite.\n\nThe year 2000 was also the year the club finalized a planned expansion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from a 20,000 to a 29,000 capacity, making it the second largest stadium in Denmark, only trailing the [[Parken Stadium]] of [[F.C. Copenhagen]]. At the cost of 250&nbsp;million DKK, the vast expenditure was seen as a sign that the club was out of its former financial crisis.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian H\u00fcttemeier, \"Supertanker p\u00e5 succeskurs\", ''[[Politiken]] article'', 22 October 2000</ref> The building project was finalized in Autumn 2000, and on 22 October, 28,416 spectators saw Br\u00f8ndby beat [[Akademisk Boldklub]] 4\u20132 in the opening match of the rebuilt stadium.\n\nHareide's visions of a 4\u20133\u20133 system never worked out, and the team soon returned to the well-known 4\u20134\u20132 setup. As he slowly lost hold of a ten-point lead to rivals F.C. Copenhagen, gained in a great first half of the [[2001\u201302 Danish Superliga|2001\u201302 Superliga season]], Hareide took his leave in spring 2002 before the last matches of the season.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Mikael B\u00f8rsting and Jesper Tornvig Ludvigsen, \"FORUDS\u00c5 HAREIDES FALD\", ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] article'', 16 April 2002</ref> He was replaced by youth team coach Tom K\u00f8hlert, who, though reluctant to take the job, gave first team debuts to the top youth team players, most notably [[Thomas Kahlenberg]], who helped the club narrowly secure the championship win on [[goal difference]].\n\n===The Laudrup years (2002\u20132006)===\nIn the 2002\u201303 pre-season, Br\u00f8ndby announced that Danish icon Michael Laudrup was taking the manager seat in his old club with John Jensen, also a club legend, as his assistant. In their first season, there were massive cuts from the very large squad; ten players were put in the reserves squad or sold and a talent squad was established. The club was to rely even more home grown players as Br\u00f8ndby was already famous for developing very talented players. In the process, Laudrup told several players to find new clubs as he thought they would not fit in the playing style he wanted to implement.\n\n[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Laudrup as Br\u00f8ndby manager]]\n\nDuring the Laudrup era, Br\u00f8ndby won the [[double (association football)|Double]] in 2005, the latest championship the club has won. The club was relatively successful in the European competitions as [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] was beaten 2\u20131<ref>[http://www.scorespro.com/soccer/livescore/br%C3%B8ndby-if-vs-fc-schalke-04/27-11-2003/ Brondby IF&nbsp;\u2013 FC Schalke 04 : 2\u20131 (Match report)] ScoresPro.com</ref> in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup]] but was later beaten by Laudrup's former club Barcelona, 0\u20131.<ref>[http://www.scorespro.com/soccer/livescore/br%C3%B8ndby-if-vs-fc-barcelona/26-02-2004/ Brondby IF&nbsp;\u2013 FC Barcelona 04 : 0\u20131 (Match report)] ScoresPro.com</ref>\n\nIn May 2006 it was announced that Laudrup and Jensen could not agree with the board of Br\u00f8ndby regarding an extension of their contracts, and the duo left the club.\n\n===Years of crisis (2006&ndash;2013)===\nThe two were replaced by Dutch coach [[Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen]], who had a rough start in charge of the first team. Together with newly appointed Anders Bjerregaard&nbsp;\u2013 son of director [[Per Bjerregaard]]&nbsp;\u2013 Meulensteen bought a number of questionable players in the final days of the summer transfer window. In the first matches, the new coach struggled with injuries among the key players and the team had problems living up to the expectations.\n\nMeulensteen resigned after six months, leaving Br\u00f8ndby in seventh position halfway through the [[2006\u201307 Danish Superliga|2006\u201307 Superliga]]. The official explanation for his departure was that his family could not settle in Denmark,<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=39710 Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r ny cheftr\u00e6ner], [[Brondby IF - official website]], 5 January 2007</ref> but soon after, the former coach revealed major infrastructural problems in the club's organization, calling the club \"a very sick patient requiring immediate attention\",<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=593131.html Rivals' pity highlights Br\u00f8ndby gloom], [[UEFA.com]], 25 September 2007</ref> as well as cliques inside the first team. In order to solve the clique problems, he had gone to director Per Bjerregaard to fire three key players&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marcus Lantz]], [[Thomas Rytter]] and one club man [[Per Nielsen]] \u2013 in order to reestablish the balance in the first team squad, a demand Danish football experts later described as the quickest way of getting sacked.\n\nTom K\u00f8hlert took the managerial reins once more, this time as a permanent solution on a two-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nAfter losing 2\u20134 to [[AC Horsens|Horsens]] on 26 August, their 23rd consecutive away match without a victory, the team was greeted by approximately 200 furious fans and cries like \"die mercenaries\" and \"we are Br\u00f8ndby, who are you?\" on their return to Br\u00f8ndby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|title=Rasende fans belejrede Br\u00f8ndbys bus|language=Danish|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=27 August 2007|publisher=[[Politiken]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084156/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2007, Per Bjerregaard announced that he resigned from the director seat, and instead took over as chairman of the board in Br\u00f8ndby IF. Shortly after his resignation, Peter Schmeichel announced that he was ready to purchase Br\u00f8ndby and become a director. The announcement divided the fans. Some praised the former player for trying to save the club, while others criticized him for bringing investor Aldo Petersen along, a keen supporter and former stockholder of rivals F.C. Copenhagen. Schmeihel's offer, however, was rejected. On 1 April 2008, Hermann Haraldsson was appointed to the vacant position.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.brondby.com/upload/biffile_h8zlc6msaabfwk3aq9hj_46124.pdf Fondsb\u00f8rsmeddelelse September 2008], Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold A/S, 13 March 2008</ref>\n\nFollowing a disappointing beginning of the [[2007\u201308 Danish Superliga|2007\u201308 Superliga season]] with only five points gained from seven matches, manager Tom K\u00f8hlert made it clear in August 2007 that the [[Danish Cup]] now had a higher priority for the club.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article367318.ece Br\u00f8ndby opprioriterer pokalturneringen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006134124/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article367318.ece |date=6 October 2008 }}, politiken.dk, 28 June 2008</ref> The change of priorities was successful, and Br\u00f8ndby won their first domestic title in almost three years on 1 May 2008 when [[Esbjerg fB|Esbjerg]] were defeated 3\u20132 in the final of the [[2007\u201308 Danish Cup]].\n\nSoon after, manager K\u00f8hlert declared his job complete, prompting club chairman Bjerregaard to search for his replacement. On 16 June 2008, the club announced the appointment of former player and head coach of Horsens, [[Kent Nielsen]].<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=47333 FBM nr 13/2008: Kent Nielsen ny tr\u00e6ner pr. 1.1. 2009], [[Brondby - official website]], 16 June 2008</ref> Nielsen took charge of the first team on 1 January 2009. Former legendary coach K\u00f8hlert led Br\u00f8ndby to the first place, where they stayed until Nielsen arrived.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, KasiGroup replaced Codan as the main sponsor of the club. The partnership involved a cooperation with [[UNICEF]], making Br\u00f8ndby the third club in Europe next to Barcelona and Swedish side [[Hammarby Fotboll]] to wear the UNICEF logo on their shirts. Furthermore, KasiGroup entered a sponsorship for the stadium and promised substantial funds for taking the player squad to the next level. During the 2008 summer break, this contributed to Br\u00f8ndby transferring five new players with national team experience in order to strengthen the team.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, KasiGroup owner Jesper Nielsen got in trouble with Br\u00f8ndby and refused to pay the remainder of the money. On 31 August 2012, Br\u00f8ndby told the Danish media B.T. that KasiGroup now owes the club more than 45&nbsp;million DKK (\u20ac6,000,000 / \u00a35,000,000).<ref>[http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/broendby-vi-skal-have-kasi-millioner Br\u00f8ndby: Vi skal have Kasi-millioner] 31 August 2012</ref> The two will meet in court next year.

A part of the merging of Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF was a promise by the Br\u00f8ndby municipality mayor to build a ground, and in 1965 it was ready for the club to play in. Through the first years in the secondary Danish leagues, the stadium was little more than a grass field with an [[sport of athletics|athletics]] track circling the field of play. It was not until 1978 that the main stand was built, sporting a capacity of 1,200 seated spectators. As newly promoted to the top Danish league in 1982, concrete terraces opposite the main stand were constructed, allowing for a crowd of 5,000 additional people. Following the first years of success in the top-flight, the athletic track was discarded and a further 2,000 seats were installed on top of the concrete stands from 1989 to 1990.\n\nWhen Br\u00f8ndby played matches against other successful European teams in the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup, the then capacity of up to 10,000 spectators was quickly dwarfed by the ticket interest. As the Denmark national stadium [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in Copenhagen was being rebuilt, the club found no other way to host the matches but to get a dispensation to use [[scaffolding]] stands, which boosted the stadium capacity to 18,000 in the semi-final leg of the tournament, a 0\u20130 draw with Roma. Following the European adventure, the club inaugurated its end stands in 1992, allowing for a total of 22,000 spectators.\n\nIn May 1998, the club bought Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from the Br\u00f8ndby municipality for 23.5&nbsp;million DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian W. Larsen, \"Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r eget stadion\", ''[[Aktuelt]] article'', 14 May 1998</ref> and immediately spent double that amount to modernize the stadium. When the club qualified for the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League]], the stadium was still under construction and the matches were moved to archrival F.C. Copenhagen's [[Parken Stadium]]. In 2000, all stands were standardized and built to the same height, allowing for crowds of 29,000 at domestic matches and 22,000 in the European matches, which allow only [[all-seater|all-seated]] crowds. Since then, the stadium has seen a number of lesser or larger infrastructural and technical enhancements, and the February 2004 European match against Barcelona was played in front of a 26,031-spectator crowd.\n\n==Organisation==\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was founded on 3 December 1964 as a merger between two small clubs, Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF from 1909 and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF from 1928, and was a broad sports association, including branches in football, [[team handball|handball]], gymnastics and badminton among others. In 1971 the club was split off into clubs for each individual sport, and Br\u00f8ndby mayor [[Kjeld Rasmussen]] became the first chairman of the footballing branch, which retained the name of Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening.\n\nWith the introduction of paid football in Denmark by the [[Danish Football Association]] in 1978, the club split into an amateur and a professional department. The amateurs consisted of the various youth departments which had been the trademark of the club since the 1964 merger, as well as the numerous volunteers who service every match of the professional club for free. In 1987 the professional department, Br\u00f8ndby IF Fodbold A/S, was the second football club in the world (with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] being the first) to float its [[share (finance)|shares]] on a public [[stock exchange]]. The shares were divided in A and B shares of equal value, with only the B shares for sale to the public. Each A share counts for ten votes and each B share counts for a single ownership vote, and the A shares were divided between three groups to prevent hostile takeovers; the volunteer amateur leaders of the club, the main sponsors of the club, and the company Euro Sportsholding, owned by Br\u00f8ndby IF itself. The A shares accounted for 64% of the votes,<ref>{{in lang|da}} Michael Aae, \"A/S FODBOLD ET HOLD TIL 70 MILLIONER\", ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] article'', 18 August 1991</ref> and thereby the power in the club.\n\nWhen the club was on the verge of financial collapse in 1992, the A shares posed as security to the creditors, until the club was saved and the shares were sold for the symbolic amount of 1 DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Steen Ankerdal, \"Fik br\u00f8ndby for en krone\", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]] article'', 7 May 1994</ref> to the newly founded Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond, which strives to keep Br\u00f8ndby IF controlled by the amateur department. The shares are currently divided into 355,000 A and 3,500,000 B shares, with Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond owning 300,000 of the A shares, accounting for 42.6% of the total votes.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=36 Distribution of shares], according to Brondby.com</ref>\n\n==Support==\nBr\u00f8ndby are the most widely popular football club in Denmark, with a 2015 study having showed that Br\u00f8ndby matches have by far the most viewers, both in the stadium and on TV.

The club was founded in 1964 as a merger between two local clubs and was promoted to the Danish top-flight football league in 1981.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby IF has won ten [[Danish football champions|Danish Championships]] and seven [[Danish Cup]]s. Br\u00f8ndby's most successful period was from 1985 to 2005 when, in twenty years, they won all of their ten league titles. In [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1991]], Br\u00f8ndby reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] and became the first and only Danish club to ever reach a European semi-final.\n\nSince the founding of fellow [[Copenhagen]] club [[F.C. Copenhagen]] in 1992 (a merger between [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] and [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]), they have had a fierce rivalry; matches between the two clubs are referred to as the [[Copenhagen Derby]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1964&ndash;1977)===\n[[File:Brondby_won_cup.jpg|thumb]]\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was formed on 3 December 1964 following a merger between two local rivals \u2013 '''Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF''' and '''[[:da:Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF|Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF]]'''. The merger was to be completed as a prerequisite for the construction of a new stadium by [[Br\u00f8ndby Municipality]].<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book|url=|title=Br\u00f8ndby IF : drengene fra Vestegnen|date=2011|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=978-87-02-10258-1|editor-last=Brock|editor-first=Jeppe Laursen}}</ref> Br\u00f8ndby IF spent its inaugural season as an amateur club in the 6th tier of the 11 Danish leagues, the Serie 1, where they finished their two first seasons in fourth place. Among the players of the early years was team captain [[Per Bjerregaard]], a doctor who had moved to Copenhagen from [[Randers]] in [[Jutland]], and Hans Gregersen, who was the mascot of the team until his death by [[syphilis]] in 1967. In 1967, the club hired coach [[Leif Andersen]] who instantly secured promotion to ''Sj\u00e6llandsserien'' (the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] series). After a few mediocre years, a new coach, John Sinding, was brought in, and the club won promotion to ''Danmarksserien'' (the Denmark series).\n\nIn 1973, Per Bjerregaard stopped his active career at 27 years of age and became chairman of Br\u00f8ndby; his first action was to sack head coach Sinding. In his place, Br\u00f8ndby hired former professional and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] player [[Finn Laudrup]], who took over as head coach while he still took actively part in the matches as a player. Laudrup joined his brother-in-law [[Ebbe Skovdahl]] in the Br\u00f8ndby team, and he brought his two young sons [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] and [[Michael Laudrup]] with him to the club. Under Finn Laudrup's influence, the club's playing style was changed to a more attacking strategy, even though Laudrup decided to fully concentrate his efforts as a player after only a year. After winning promotion in 1974, Laudrup left Br\u00f8ndby in the 3rd Division in 1976 to play for [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub|KB]] in the Danish top-flight league (then named the 1st Division) and a year later Michael Laudrup, the brightest talent in Danish football, followed.\n\n===Professional football (1977&ndash;1987)===\nIn 1977, Br\u00f8ndby moved up into the 2nd Division, and were one of the clubs who quickly adapted to the new times of paid football in the best Danish leagues in 1978. Per Bjerregaard persuaded Finn Laudrup into returning to Br\u00f8ndby in 1981 on a professional contract, and following a season of 85 goals in 30 matches, Br\u00f8ndby won promotion to the top-flight 1st Division under coach [[Tom K\u00f8hlert]]. Finn Laudrup subsequently ended his career at age 36, but in his place Michael Laudrup returned for the [[1982 in Danish football|1982 season]], being one of ten players leaving KB that year.\n\nBr\u00f8ndby won their 1st Division debut match 7\u20131 over fellow [[promotion (sports)|promoted]] team [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] in a match which featured two goals from Michael Laudrup. He was subsequently called up for the Denmark national team, and on 15 June 1982 he became the first Br\u00f8ndby player to win a [[cap (football)|cap]] for the national team. Br\u00f8ndby finished their first 1st Division season in fourth place with Laudrup the league's third top goal scorer with 15 goals, earning him the [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. In 1983, Laudrup was sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the then-biggest transfer deal in Denmark, giving Br\u00f8ndby the economic foundation to expand further.\n\nAfter four years in the top division, Br\u00f8ndby won their first Danish championship in [[Danish 1st Division 1985|1985]] and played its first European match when the club beat [[Hungary|Hungarian]] champions [[Budapest Honv\u00e9d FC|Budapest Honv\u00e9d]] 4\u20131 in the 1986 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. In 1986, Br\u00f8ndby became the first Danish club of fully professionals when ten players were signed full-time, and the club was introduced at the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] in 1987.\n\n===European success (1987&ndash;1992)===\nThroughout the second half of the 1980s, the team dominated the league and did not finish lower than second place until 1992. The team was built around talented Danish players, and from 1987 to 1991 players from Br\u00f8ndby won the Danish Player of the Year award every year. The recipients formed the backbone of the Denmark national team which later won [[UEFA Euro 1992]], and was the first goalscorer in the 2\u20130 Euro 1992 final win [[John Jensen|John \"Faxe\" Jensen]] (1987), national team captain [[Lars Olsen]] (1988), the World's Best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]] 1992 and 1993 award winner [[Peter Schmeichel]] (1989), four-time Danish Player of the Year award winner Brian Laudrup (1990) and the second goalscorer of the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|Euro 1992 final]] [[Kim Vilfort]] (1991). The club became used to winning the national title and turned its attention towards European success.\n\nIn 1990, Br\u00f8ndby hired former national team captain [[Morten Olsen]] as coach, and under his reign, the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]] became the high point in the short history of the club. Especially the meriting wins over German sides [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], and Russian club [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] saw the many Danish profiles shine, and the club was minutes from qualifying for the final match of the tournament. In the 88th minute of the semi-final, however, a [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] goal denied Br\u00f8ndby a trip to the UEFA Cup final in favour of [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Following the impressive European display by the comparatively small club, important members of the team, including Lars Olsen, top scoring [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Bent Christensen Arens\u00f8e|Bent \"Turbo\" Christensen]] and star goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, left the club.\n\nThe following year, 1992, was the worst year in the club's history as the intended takeover of the Danish bank [[Interbank]] went awry. It was expected that European Cup success would boost the Br\u00f8ndby stock value in order to finance the buy, but as the club was beaten by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] qualification, the stocks never reached the value necessary to finalize the deal. It had been arranged for financial backers Hafnia Insurance Company to step in and take over the buy in case Br\u00f8ndby could not finance it, but as Hafnia went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], Br\u00f8ndby were forced to buy Interbank and financial collapse was imminent as club debts amassed to 400 million [[Danish krone|DKK]].<ref>{{in lang|da}} Henrik H. Brandt, \"Br\u00f8ndby IF: Mirakelkuren\", ''[[Jyllands-Posten]] article'', 1 June 1997</ref> A long-term rescue plan was initiated to save the club, but these events influenced the performance of the team and the championship, now called the Danish Superliga, was not won again until [[1995\u201396 Danish Superliga|1996]].\n\n===Rebuilding (1992&ndash;2002)===\nThe rebuilding of the team was led by head coach [[Ebbe Skovdahl]], who deployed the team in a [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4-4-2 formation]]. The return to the club of Euro 1992 veterans John Jensen and captain Lars Olsen combined with the emergence of goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and striker [[Ebbe Sand]] got the club back on its feet. The rebuilding culminated in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup]] elimination of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], though Roma once again knocked Br\u00f8ndby out. Including that year, Br\u00f8ndby won three Danish championships in a row, and [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|the next year's UEFA Cup]] saw one of the biggest upsets in Br\u00f8ndby history, as a 3\u20131 home defeat to [[Karlsruher SC]] was changed to an aggregate win when Br\u00f8ndby beat the team of [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] winner [[Thomas H\u00e4\u00dfler]] 5\u20130 away in Germany. Most importantly for the club's economy, Br\u00f8ndby qualified for the new format of the European Cup, rebranded as the UEFA Champions League.<ref name=\"First CL qualification\">\n\nDanish club [[AaB Fodbold|Aalborg BK]] played in the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League|1995\u201396 Champions League]] tournament as a result of the bribing scandal of Dynamo Kyiv, thus they did not qualify through the qualification rounds.</ref> The Champions League qualification meant six guaranteed matches in a [[Round-robin tournament|group stage]] with three of the biggest teams of Europe, and when they were paired with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and later finalists [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Br\u00f8ndby faced very economically attractive matches. Despite winning 2\u20131 over Bayern in the first match of the group stage, Br\u00f8ndby conceded 18 goals in 6 matches and were eliminated with a single win to their name.\n\nSkovdahl decided to take a stab at coaching at Scottish club [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and Br\u00f8ndby took a more [[Scandinavia]]n approach, in search of stable success in the European competitions with Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] the role model.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Kurt Lassen and Thorsten Dam, \"Br\u00f8ndby enig med Hareide\", ''[[Berlingske Tidende]] article'', 17 April 1999</ref> The club hired Norwegian manager [[\u00c5ge Hareide]] in 2000, who proclaimed a shift in line-up to a more attacking [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133 system]]. With Hareide came a handful of Scandinavian players of whom especially [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]] player [[Mattias Jonson]] became a fan favourite.\n\nThe year 2000 was also the year the club finalized a planned expansion of Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from a 20,000 to a 29,000 capacity, making it the second largest stadium in Denmark, only trailing the [[Parken Stadium]] of [[F.C. Copenhagen]]. At the cost of 250&nbsp;million DKK, the vast expenditure was seen as a sign that the club was out of its former financial crisis.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian H\u00fcttemeier, \"Supertanker p\u00e5 succeskurs\", ''[[Politiken]] article'', 22 October 2000</ref> The building project was finalized in Autumn 2000, and on 22 October, 28,416 spectators saw Br\u00f8ndby beat [[Akademisk Boldklub]] 4\u20132 in the opening match of the rebuilt stadium.\n\nHareide's visions of a 4\u20133\u20133 system never worked out, and the team soon returned to the well-known 4\u20134\u20132 setup. As he slowly lost hold of a ten-point lead to rivals F.C. Copenhagen, gained in a great first half of the [[2001\u201302 Danish Superliga|2001\u201302 Superliga season]], Hareide took his leave in spring 2002 before the last matches of the season.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Mikael B\u00f8rsting and Jesper Tornvig Ludvigsen, \"FORUDS\u00c5 HAREIDES FALD\", ''[[B.T.

In their first season, there were massive cuts from the very large squad; ten players were put in the reserves squad or sold and a talent squad was established. The club was to rely even more home grown players as Br\u00f8ndby was already famous for developing very talented players. In the process, Laudrup told several players to find new clubs as he thought they would not fit in the playing style he wanted to implement.\n\n[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Laudrup as Br\u00f8ndby manager]]\n\nDuring the Laudrup era, Br\u00f8ndby won the [[double (association football)|Double]] in 2005, the latest championship the club has won.

Together with newly appointed Anders Bjerregaard&nbsp;\u2013 son of director [[Per Bjerregaard]]&nbsp;\u2013 Meulensteen bought a number of questionable players in the final days of the summer transfer window. In the first matches, the new coach struggled with injuries among the key players and the team had problems living up to the expectations.\n\nMeulensteen resigned after six months, leaving Br\u00f8ndby in seventh position halfway through the [[2006\u201307 Danish Superliga|2006\u201307 Superliga]]. The official explanation for his departure was that his family could not settle in Denmark,<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=39710 Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r ny cheftr\u00e6ner], [[Brondby IF - official website]], 5 January 2007</ref> but soon after, the former coach revealed major infrastructural problems in the club's organization, calling the club \"a very sick patient requiring immediate attention\",<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=593131.html Rivals' pity highlights Br\u00f8ndby gloom], [[UEFA.com]], 25 September 2007</ref> as well as cliques inside the first team. In order to solve the clique problems, he had gone to director Per Bjerregaard to fire three key players&nbsp;\u2013 [[Marcus Lantz]], [[Thomas Rytter]] and one club man [[Per Nielsen]] \u2013 in order to reestablish the balance in the first team squad, a demand Danish football experts later described as the quickest way of getting sacked.\n\nTom K\u00f8hlert took the managerial reins once more, this time as a permanent solution on a two-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nAfter losing 2\u20134 to [[AC Horsens|Horsens]] on 26 August, their 23rd consecutive away match without a victory, the team was greeted by approximately 200 furious fans and cries like \"die mercenaries\" and \"we are Br\u00f8ndby, who are you?\" on their return to Br\u00f8ndby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|title=Rasende fans belejrede Br\u00f8ndbys bus|language=Danish|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=27 August 2007|publisher=[[Politiken]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084156/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article366502.ece|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 August 2007, Per Bjerregaard announced that he resigned from the director seat, and instead took over as chairman of the board in Br\u00f8ndby IF. Shortly after his resignation, Peter Schmeichel announced that he was ready to purchase Br\u00f8ndby and become a director. The announcement divided the fans. Some praised the former player for trying to save the club, while others criticized him for bringing investor Aldo Petersen along, a keen supporter and former stockholder of rivals F.C. Copenhagen. Schmeihel's offer, however, was rejected.

On 16 June 2008, the club announced the appointment of former player and head coach of Horsens, [[Kent Nielsen]].<ref>[http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=47333 FBM nr 13/2008: Kent Nielsen ny tr\u00e6ner pr. 1.1. 2009], [[Brondby - official website]], 16 June 2008</ref> Nielsen took charge of the first team on 1 January 2009. Former legendary coach K\u00f8hlert led Br\u00f8ndby to the first place, where they stayed until Nielsen arrived.\n\nOn 1 July 2008, KasiGroup replaced Codan as the main sponsor of the club. The partnership involved a cooperation with [[UNICEF]], making Br\u00f8ndby the third club in Europe next to Barcelona and Swedish side [[Hammarby Fotboll]] to wear the UNICEF logo on their shirts. Furthermore, KasiGroup entered a sponsorship for the stadium and promised substantial funds for taking the player squad to the next level. During the 2008 summer break, this contributed to Br\u00f8ndby transferring five new players with national team experience in order to strengthen the team.\n\nOn 30 December 2009, KasiGroup owner Jesper Nielsen got in trouble with Br\u00f8ndby and refused to pay the remainder of the money. On 31 August 2012, Br\u00f8ndby told the Danish media B.T. that KasiGroup now owes the club more than 45&nbsp;million DKK (\u20ac6,000,000 / \u00a35,000,000).<ref>[http://www.sporten.dk/fodbold/broendby-vi-skal-have-kasi-millioner Br\u00f8ndby: Vi skal have Kasi-millioner] 31 August 2012</ref> The two will meet in court next year. Nielsen told B.T. that he could recognize the amount but that his lawyer thought they could make a settlement at a much lower figure than the 45&nbsp;million.\n\nNielsen was the owner of [[AG K\u00f8benhavn]], which went bankrupt on 31 July 2012 due to his overuse of money. Nielsen is thus both chased by Br\u00f8ndby and the Danish tax authorities.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Haandbold/Liga_maend/2012/08/06/083157.htm SKAT kr\u00e6ver 168 millioner af Kasi-familien] 6 August 2012</ref> Br\u00f8ndby is still looking for a new main sponsor as it has not been possible to find one yet.

A part of the merging of Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF was a promise by the Br\u00f8ndby municipality mayor to build a ground, and in 1965 it was ready for the club to play in. Through the first years in the secondary Danish leagues, the stadium was little more than a grass field with an [[sport of athletics|athletics]] track circling the field of play. It was not until 1978 that the main stand was built, sporting a capacity of 1,200 seated spectators. As newly promoted to the top Danish league in 1982, concrete terraces opposite the main stand were constructed, allowing for a crowd of 5,000 additional people. Following the first years of success in the top-flight, the athletic track was discarded and a further 2,000 seats were installed on top of the concrete stands from 1989 to 1990.\n\nWhen Br\u00f8ndby played matches against other successful European teams in the 1990\u201391 UEFA Cup, the then capacity of up to 10,000 spectators was quickly dwarfed by the ticket interest. As the Denmark national stadium [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in Copenhagen was being rebuilt, the club found no other way to host the matches but to get a dispensation to use [[scaffolding]] stands, which boosted the stadium capacity to 18,000 in the semi-final leg of the tournament, a 0\u20130 draw with Roma. Following the European adventure, the club inaugurated its end stands in 1992, allowing for a total of 22,000 spectators.\n\nIn May 1998, the club bought Br\u00f8ndby Stadium from the Br\u00f8ndby municipality for 23.5&nbsp;million DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Christian W. Larsen, \"Br\u00f8ndby f\u00e5r eget stadion\", ''[[Aktuelt]] article'', 14 May 1998</ref> and immediately spent double that amount to modernize the stadium. When the club qualified for the [[1998\u201399 UEFA Champions League]], the stadium was still under construction and the matches were moved to archrival F.C. Copenhagen's [[Parken Stadium]]. In 2000, all stands were standardized and built to the same height, allowing for crowds of 29,000 at domestic matches and 22,000 in the European matches, which allow only [[all-seater|all-seated]] crowds. Since then, the stadium has seen a number of lesser or larger infrastructural and technical enhancements, and the February 2004 European match against Barcelona was played in front of a 26,031-spectator crowd.\n\n==Organisation==\nBr\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening was founded on 3 December 1964 as a merger between two small clubs, Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF from 1909 and Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF from 1928, and was a broad sports association, including branches in football, [[team handball|handball]], gymnastics and badminton among others. In 1971 the club was split off into clubs for each individual sport, and Br\u00f8ndby mayor [[Kjeld Rasmussen]] became the first chairman of the footballing branch, which retained the name of Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening.\n\nWith the introduction of paid football in Denmark by the [[Danish Football Association]] in 1978, the club split into an amateur and a professional department. The amateurs consisted of the various youth departments which had been the trademark of the club since the 1964 merger, as well as the numerous volunteers who service every match of the professional club for free. In 1987 the professional department, Br\u00f8ndby IF Fodbold A/S, was the second football club in the world (with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] being the first) to float its [[share (finance)|shares]] on a public [[stock exchange]]. The shares were divided in A and B shares of equal value, with only the B shares for sale to the public. Each A share counts for ten votes and each B share counts for a single ownership vote, and the A shares were divided between three groups to prevent hostile takeovers; the volunteer amateur leaders of the club, the main sponsors of the club, and the company Euro Sportsholding, owned by Br\u00f8ndby IF itself. The A shares accounted for 64% of the votes,<ref>{{in lang|da}} Michael Aae, \"A/S FODBOLD ET HOLD TIL 70 MILLIONER\", ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]] article'', 18 August 1991</ref> and thereby the power in the club.\n\nWhen the club was on the verge of financial collapse in 1992, the A shares posed as security to the creditors, until the club was saved and the shares were sold for the symbolic amount of 1 DKK<ref>{{in lang|da}} Steen Ankerdal, \"Fik br\u00f8ndby for en krone\", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]] article'', 7 May 1994</ref> to the newly founded Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond, which strives to keep Br\u00f8ndby IF controlled by the amateur department. The shares are currently divided into 355,000 A and 3,500,000 B shares, with Br\u00f8ndbyernes IF Fodbold Fond owning 300,000 of the A shares, accounting for 42.6% of the total votes.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=36 Distribution of shares], according to Brondby.com</ref>\n\n==Support==\nBr\u00f8ndby are the most widely popular football club in Denmark, with a 2015 study having showed that Br\u00f8ndby matches have by far the most viewers, both in the stadium and on TV.

As seen today,{{when|date=September 2019}} boiler explosions are of two kinds. One kind is a failure of the pressure parts of the [[steam]] and [[water]] sides. There can be many different causes, such as failure of the [[safety valve]], [[corrosion]] of critical parts of the boiler, or low water level. Corrosion along the edges of [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions.\n\nThe second kind is a fuel/air explosion in the [[furnace]], which would more properly be termed a firebox explosion. Firebox explosions in solid-fuel-fired boilers are rare, but firebox explosions in gas or oil-fired boilers are still a potential hazard.\n\n== Causes of boiler explosions ==\n[[File:CrashCrushTx.jpg|thumb|right|The Crash at [[Crush, Texas]], 1896, in which the boilers of two locomotives crashed into one another for a publicity stunt exploded; two people died in the incident, and many more were injured.]]\nThere are many causes for boiler explosions such as poor water treatment causing scaling and over heating of the plates, low water level, a stuck safety valve, or even a furnace explosion that in turn, if severe enough, can cause a boiler explosion. Poor operator training resulting in neglect or other mishandling of the boiler has been a frequent cause of explosions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the inspection records of various sources in the U.S., UK, and Europe showed that the most frequent cause of boiler explosions was weakening of boilers through simple rusting, by anywhere from two to five times more than all other causes.\n\nBefore materials science, inspection standards, and quality control caught up with the rapidly growing boiler manufacturing industry, a significant number of boiler explosions were directly traceable to poor design, workmanship, and undetected flaws in poor quality materials. The alarming frequency of boiler failures in the U.S. due to defects in materials and design were attracting the attention of international engineering standards organizations, such as [https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history the ASME], which established their first Boiler Testing Code in 1884.  The boiler explosion that caused the [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]] in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 10, 1905 resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries, and inspired the state of Massachusetts to publish its first boiler laws in 1908.\n\nSeveral written sources provide a concise description of the causes of boiler explosions:\n\n<blockquote>\"The principal causes of explosions, in fact the only causes, are deficiency of strength in the shell or other parts of the boilers, over-pressure and over-heating. Deficiency of strength in steam boilers may be due to original defects, bad workmanship, deterioration from use or mismanagement.\"''<ref>Roper, Stephen (1899). ''Roper's Engineer's Handy Book'' (15th edition) Philadelphia: David McKay (p.207\u2013208)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd:\n\n<blockquote>\"Cause.-Boiler explosions are always due to the fact that some part of the boiler is, for some reason, too weak to withstand the pressure to which it is subjected. This may be due to one of two causes: Either the boiler is not strong enough to safely carry its proper working pressure, or else the pressure has been allowed to rise above the usual point by the sticking of the safety valves, or some similar cause\"''<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) ''Locomotive Boilers'' (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Statione's Hall, London: International Textbook Company</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Early investigations into the causes of boiler explosions ==\nWhile deterioration and mishandling are probably the most common ''causes'' of boiler explosions, the actual ''mechanism'' of a catastrophic boiler failure was not well documented until extensive experimentation was undertaken by U.S. boiler inspectors in the early 20th century. Several different attempts were made to cause a boiler to explode by various means, but one of the most interesting experiments demonstrated that in certain circumstances, if a sudden opening in the boiler allowed steam to escape too rapidly, [[water hammer]] could cause destruction of the entire pressure vessel:\n\n<blockquote>\"A cylindrical boiler was tested and withstood a steam pressure of 300 pounds without injury.\" \" When the [discharge] valve was suddenly opened at a pressure of 235 pounds [{{cvt|235|psi|disp=or||}}] the boiler gave way, the iron being twisted and torn into fragments and thrown in all directions. The reason for this was that the sudden rush of steam from the boiler into the discharge pipe reduced the pressure in the boiler very rapidly. This reduction of pressure caused the sudden formation of a great quantity of steam within the water, and the heavy mass of water being thrown with great violence toward the opening whence the steam was being withdrawn, struck the portions of the boiler near that opening and caused the fracture.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Colliery Engineers Company \u2013 Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59)|last=|first=|publisher=Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=(Sec.12-p.76)}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut the highly destructive mechanism of [[water hammer]] in boiler explosions was understood long before then, as D. K. Clark wrote on 10th February, 1860, in a letter to the editors of \"Mechanics Magazine\":<blockquote>\"The sudden dispersion and projection of the water in the boiler against the bounding surfaces of the boiler is the great cause of the violence of the results: the dispersion, being caused by the momentary generation of steam throughout the mass of the water, and in its efforts to escape, it carries the water before it, and the combined momentum of the steam and the water carries them like shot through and amongst the bounding surfaces, and deforms or shatters them in a manner not to be accounted for by simple overpressure or by simple momentum of steam.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steam boiler explosions|last=Colburn, Zerah, 1832-1870.|date=1873|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|oclc=4741077}}</ref></blockquote>Boiler explosions are common in sinking ships once the superheated boiler touches cold sea water, as the sudden cooling of the superheated metal causes it to crack; for instance, when the {{SS|Benlomond|1922|6}} was torpedoed by a U-boat, the torpedoes and resulting boiler explosion caused the ship to go down in two minutes, leaving [[Poon Lim]] as the only survivor in a complement of 54 crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/2462.html|title=Benlomond (British Steam merchant) \u2013 Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII \u2013 uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~judkins/survival.htm|title=Miracle Survival \u2013 Poon Lim|first=George|last=Judkins|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref>\n\n== Locomotive-type boiler explosions ==\nBoiler explosions are of a particular danger in (locomotive-type) [[fire-tube boiler|fire tube boilers]] because the top of the firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown [[Boiler stay|stays]] to the point of failure, ''even at normal working pressure''.\n\nThis was the cause of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox explosion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SIR9605.pdf|title=STEAM LOCOMOTIVE FIREBOX EXPLOSION ON THE GETTYSBURG RAILROAD NEAR GARDNERS, PENNSYLVANIA JUNE 16, 1995|last=NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD}}</ref> near Gardners, Pennsylvania, in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox. The crown sheet design included several alternating rows of button-head safety stays, which limited the failure of the crown sheet to the first five or six rows of conventional stays, preventing a collapse of the entire crown sheet.\n\nThis type of failure is not limited to railway engines, as locomotive-type boilers have been used for traction engines, portable engines, skid engines used for mining or logging, stationary engines for sawmills and factories, for heating, and as [[package boiler]]s providing steam for other processes. In all applications, maintaining the proper water level is essential for safe operation.\n\n== Principle ==\nMany shell-type boilers carry a large bath of liquid water which is heated to a higher temperature and pressure ([[enthalpy]]) than boiling water would be at atmospheric pressure. During normal operation, the liquid water remains in the bottom of the boiler due to gravity, steam bubbles rise through the liquid water and collect at the top for use until saturation pressure is reached, then the boiling stops. If some pressure is released, boiling begins again, and so on.\n\nIf steam is released normally, say by opening a throttle valve, the bubbling action of the water remains moderate and relatively dry steam can be drawn from the highest point in the vessel.\n\nIf steam is released more quickly, the more vigorous boiling action that results can throw a fine spray of droplets up as \"wet steam\" which can cause damage to piping, engines, turbines and other equipment downstream.\n\nIf a large crack or other opening in the boiler vessel allows the internal pressure to drop very suddenly, the heat energy remaining in the water will cause even more of the liquid to flash into steam bubbles, which then rapidly displace the remaining liquid. The potential energy of the escaping steam and water are now transformed into work, just as they would have done in an engine; with enough force to peel back the material around the break, severely distorting the shape of the plate which was formerly held in place by stays, or self-supported by its original cylindrical shape. The rapid release of steam and water can provide a very potent blast, and cause great damage to surrounding property or personnel.\n\nThe rapidly expanding steam bubbles can also perform work by throwing large \"slugs\" of water inside the boiler in the direction of the opening, and at astonishing velocities. A fast-moving mass of water carries a great deal of kinetic energy (from the expanding steam), and in collision with the shell of the boiler results in a violent destructive effect. This can greatly enlarge the original rupture, or tear the shell in two.<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company (sec.12,p.76)</ref>\n\nMany plumbers, firefighters, and  [[steamfitter]]s are aware of this phenomenon, which is called  \"[[water hammer]]\". A several-ounce \"slug\" of water passing through a steam line at high velocity and striking a 90-degree elbow can instantly fracture a fitting that is otherwise capable of handling several times the normal static pressure. It can then be understood that a few hundred, or even a few thousand pounds of water ''moving at the same velocity'' inside a boiler shell can easily blow out a tube sheet, collapse a firebox, even toss the entire boiler a surprising distance through reaction as the water exits the boiler, like the [[recoil]] of a heavy cannon firing a ball.\n\nSeveral accounts of the [[SL-1]] [[SL-1|experimental reactor accident]] vividly describe the incredibly powerful effect of water hammer on a pressure vessel: <blockquote>\"The expansion caused by this heating process caused water hammer as water was accelerated upwards toward the reactor vessel head, producing approximately 10,000 pounds per square inch (69,000 kPa) of pressure on the head of the reactor vessel when water struck the head at 160 feet per second (50&nbsp;m/s) ...This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000-pound (12,000&nbsp;kg) vessel had jumped 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.id.energy.gov/Foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf|title=IDO-19313 \"ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SL-1 EXCURSION\" November 12, 1962. Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho.}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA steam locomotive operating at {{cvt|350|psi|||}} would have a temperature of about {{convert|225|C|||}}, and a specific enthalpy of {{cvt|963.7|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}}.<ref>Milo D. Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 508</ref> Since standard pressure saturated water has a specific enthalpy of just {{cvt|418.91|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}},<ref>Milo D. Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 509</ref> the difference between the two specific enthalpies, {{cvt|544.8|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}}, is the total energy expended in the explosion. So in the case of a large locomotive which can hold as much as {{cvt|10000|kg|||}} of water at a high pressure and temperature state, this explosion would have an theoretical energy release equal to about {{convert|1160|kg|||}} of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]].\n\n== Firebox explosions ==\nIn the case of a [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] explosion, these typically occur after a burner [[flameout]]. Oil fumes, natural gas, propane, coal, or any other fuel can build up inside the combustion chamber. This is especially of concern when the vessel is hot; the fuels will rapidly volatize due to the temperature. Once the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) is reached, any source of ignition will cause an explosion of the vapors.\n\nA fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox may damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering structural failure, steam or water leakage, and/or a secondary boiler shell failure and [[steam explosion]].\n\nA common form of minor firebox \"explosion\" is known as \"drumming\" and can occur with any type of fuel. Instead of the normal \"roar\" of the fire, a rhythmic series of \"thumps\" and flashes of fire below the grate and through the [[firedoor]] indicate that the combustion of the fuel is proceeding through a rapid series of detonations, caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture with regard to the level of draft available. This usually causes no damage in locomotive type boilers, but can cause cracks in masonry boiler settings if allowed to continue.\n\n=== Grooving ===\nThe plates of early locomotive boilers were joined by simple [[lap joint|overlapping joints]]. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, along the length of the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), along the length of the joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure.<ref>Hewison (1983: 59 et sec)</ref> It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level.<ref name= CHH15>Hewison (1983: 15)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Thomas|date=1 October 1867|title=On single and double riveted joints|journal=Transactions for 1866|publisher=[[Society of Engineers UK|Society of Engineers]]|location=London|page=150}}</ref> Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or double butt-strap seams, which do not suffer from this defect.\n\nDue to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a similar form of \"stress corrosion\" can take place at the ends of staybolts where they enter the firebox plates, and is accelerated by poor water quality.  Often referred to as [https://www.dli.mn.gov/sites/default/files/image016.jpg \"necking\"], this type of corrosion can reduce the strength of the staybolts until they are incapable of supporting the firebox at normal pressure.\n\nGrooving (deep, localized pitting) also occurs near the waterline, particularly in boilers that are fed with water that has not been de-aerated or treated with oxygen scavenging agents. All \"natural\" sources of water contain dissolved air, which is released as a gas when the water is heated. The air (which contains oxygen) collects in a layer near the surface of the water and greatly accelerates corrosion of the boiler plates in that area.<ref>Graham, Frank D. (1945) \"Audel's Power Plant Engineers guide\" New York, Ny: Theo Audel and Co. (p.332-333, figure 55: \"corrosion along the water line due to air\")</ref>\n\n=== Firebox ===\nThe intricate shape of a locomotive firebox, whether made of soft copper or of steel, can only resist the  steam pressure on its internal walls  if these are supported by [[Firebox (steam engine)#Sheets and stays|stays]] attached to internal girders and the outer walls. They are liable to fail through [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] (because the inner and outer walls expand at different rates under the heat of the fire), from corrosion, or from wasting as  the heads of the  stays exposed to the fire are burned away. If the stays fail the firebox will explode inwards.

Of the 450 passengers on board more than 250 died, including Henry Clemens, the younger brother of the author [[Mark Twain]].\n\n[[SS Ada Hancock]], a small [[steamboat]] used to transfer passengers and cargo to and from the large coastal [[steamship]]s that stopped in [[San Pedro Harbor]] in the early 1860s, suffered disaster when its boiler exploded violently in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], the port of [[Los Angeles]], near [[Wilmington, California]] on April 27, 1863 killing twenty-six people and injuring many others of the fifty-three or more passengers on board.\n\nThe [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] was destroyed in an explosion on 27 April 1865, resulting in the greatest maritime disaster in [[United States]] history.  An estimated 1,549 passengers were killed when three of the ship's four boilers exploded and the ''Sultana'' burned and sank not far from [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The cause was traced to a poorly executed repair to the shell of one boiler; the patch failed, and debris from that boiler ruptured two more.\n\nAnother US Civil War Steamboat explosion was the Steamer ''Eclipse'' on January 27, 1865, which was carrying members of the [[9th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery|9th Indiana Artillery]].

One of the first investigators of the problem was [[William Fairbairn]], who helped establish the first insurance company dealing with the losses such explosions could cause. He also established experimentally that the [[hoop stress]] in a cylindrical pressure vessel like a boiler was twice the [[longitudinal stress]].<ref group=\"notes\">[[William Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s theoretical calculation assumes that the cylindrical vessel is much longer than its diameter. In practice, this is a viable approximation for any boiler that is a [[right cylinder]] or longer. Even for a short, squat boiler such as the [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch]], the reduced end area due to the tubes and their staying effect on the end-plates means that the principal stress is still this hoop stress.</ref> Such investigations helped him and others explain the importance of [[stress concentration]]s in weakening boilers.\n\n== Modern boilers ==\nModern boilers are designed with redundant pumps, valves, water level monitors, fuel cutoffs, automated controls, and pressure [[relief valves]]. In addition, the construction must adhere to strict engineering guidelines set by the relevant authorities. The [[National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors#National Board Inspection Code|NBIC]], [[ASME]], and others attempt to ensure safe boiler designs by publishing detailed standards. The result is a boiler unit which is less prone to catastrophic accidents.\n\nAlso improving safety is the increasing use of \"package boilers.\" These are boilers which are built at a factory then shipped out as a complete unit to the job site.  These typically have better quality and fewer issues than boilers which are site assembled tube-by-tube. A package boiler only needs the final connections to be made (electrical, breaching, condensate lines, etc.) to complete the installation.\n\n== Steam explosions ==\nIn [[steam locomotive]] boilers, as knowledge was gained by [[trial and error]] in early days, the explosive situations and consequent damage due to explosions were inevitable. However, improved design and [[Fire-tube boiler#Maintenance|maintenance]] markedly reduced the number of boiler explosions by the end of the 19th century.  Further improvements continued in the 20th century.\n\nOn land-based boilers, explosions of the pressure systems happened regularly in stationary steam boilers in the [[Victorian era]], but are now very rare because of the various [[Safety|protections]] provided, and because of regular inspections compelled by [[governmental]] and industry requirements.\n\n{{See also|List of boiler explosions}}\n\n[[Water heating|Water heaters]] can [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Exploding Water Heater|explode with surprising violence]] when their safety devices fail.\n\n=== Reactor explosions ===\nA steam explosion can occur in any kind of a water heater, where a sufficient amount of energy is delivered and the steam created exceeds the strength of the vessel. When the heat delivery is sufficiently rapid, a localized superheating can occur, resulting in a water hammer destroying the vessel. The [[SL-1]] nuclear reactor accident is an example of a superheated burst of steam.  However, in the SL1 example the pressure was released by the forced ejection of control rods which allowed the steam to be vented.  The reactor did not explode, nor did the vessel rupture.\n\n== Locomotive boiler explosions in the UK ==\n[[File:Boiler explosion 1850.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of a boiler explosion on a railway locomotive circa 1850.]]\nHewison (1983)<ref>[[#Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions|Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions]]</ref> gives a comprehensive account of British boiler explosions, listing 137 between 1815 and 1962.  It is noteworthy that 122 of these were in the 19th century and only 15 in the 20th century.\n\nBoiler explosions generally fell into two categories.  The first is the breakage of the boiler barrel itself, through weakness/damage or excessive internal pressure, resulting in sudden discharge of steam over a wide area. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] at the [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions, probably caused by [[caustic embrittlement]]. The water used in boilers was not often closely controlled, and if acidic, could corrode the [[wrought iron]] boiler plates. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was an additional problem where [[copper]] and iron were in contact.\nBoiler plates have been thrown up to a quarter of a mile (Hewison, Rolt). The second type is the collapse of the firebox under steam pressure from the adjoining boiler, releasing flames and hot gases into the cab. Improved design and maintenance almost totally eliminated the first type, but the second type is always possible if the engineer and fireman do not maintain the water level in the boiler.\n\nBoiler barrels could explode if the internal pressure became too high.  To prevent this, safety valves were installed to release the pressure at a set level. Early examples were spring-loaded, but [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof valve which was universally adopted. The other common cause of explosions was internal [[corrosion]] which weakened the boiler barrel so that it could not withstand normal operating pressure. In particular, grooves could occur along horizontal seams (lap joints) below water level. Dozens of explosions resulted, but were eliminated by 1900 by the adoption of butt joints, plus improved maintenance schedules and regular hydraulic testing.\n\nFireboxes were generally made of [[copper]], though later locomotives had [[steel]] fireboxes.  They were held to the outer part of the boiler by stays (numerous small supports).  Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening.  The usual cause of firebox collapses is that the boiler water level falls too low and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) becomes uncovered and overheats.  This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the level indicator (gauge glass) is faulty.  A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, two boiler barrel failures and thirteen firebox collapses occurred in the UK. The boiler barrel failures occurred at Cardiff in 1909 and Buxton in 1921; both were caused by misassembly of the [[safety valve]]s causing the boilers to exceed their design pressures. Of the 13 firebox collapses, four were due to broken stays, one to scale buildup on the firebox, and the rest were due to low water level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Steam explosion]]\n* [[Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion|Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE)]]\n* [[Fire-tube boiler#Safety considerations|Boiler safety]]\n* [[Fusible plug]]\n* [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]]\n* [[List of boiler explosions]]\n* [[Lists of rail accidents]]\n* [[William Fairbairn]]\n* [[John Hick (MP)|John Hick]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Christian H. | last=Hewison\n  | year=1983\n  | title=Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=David and Charles\n  | isbn=0-7153-8305-1\n  |ref=Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=L.T.C. | last=Rolt\n  | authorlink=\n  | date=1956 (and later editions)\n  | title=Red for Danger\n  | edition=\n  | publisher= Bodley Head / David and Charles / Pan Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Alan | last=McEwen\n  | year=2009\n  | title=Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=Sledgehammer Engineering Press\n  | isbn=978-0-9532725-2-5\n  |ref=McEwen, Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bartrip, P.W.J.

As seen today,{{when|date=September 2019}} boiler explosions are of two kinds. One kind is a failure of the pressure parts of the [[steam]] and [[water]] sides. There can be many different causes, such as failure of the [[safety valve]], [[corrosion]] of critical parts of the boiler, or low water level. Corrosion along the edges of [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions.\n\nThe second kind is a fuel/air explosion in the [[furnace]], which would more properly be termed a firebox explosion. Firebox explosions in solid-fuel-fired boilers are rare, but firebox explosions in gas or oil-fired boilers are still a potential hazard.\n\n== Causes of boiler explosions ==\n[[File:CrashCrushTx.jpg|thumb|right|The Crash at [[Crush, Texas]], 1896, in which the boilers of two locomotives crashed into one another for a publicity stunt exploded; two people died in the incident, and many more were injured.]]\nThere are many causes for boiler explosions such as poor water treatment causing scaling and over heating of the plates, low water level, a stuck safety valve, or even a furnace explosion that in turn, if severe enough, can cause a boiler explosion. Poor operator training resulting in neglect or other mishandling of the boiler has been a frequent cause of explosions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the inspection records of various sources in the U.S., UK, and Europe showed that the most frequent cause of boiler explosions was weakening of boilers through simple rusting, by anywhere from two to five times more than all other causes.\n\nBefore materials science, inspection standards, and quality control caught up with the rapidly growing boiler manufacturing industry, a significant number of boiler explosions were directly traceable to poor design, workmanship, and undetected flaws in poor quality materials. The alarming frequency of boiler failures in the U.S. due to defects in materials and design were attracting the attention of international engineering standards organizations, such as [https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history the ASME], which established their first Boiler Testing Code in 1884.  The boiler explosion that caused the [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]] in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 10, 1905 resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries, and inspired the state of Massachusetts to publish its first boiler laws in 1908.\n\nSeveral written sources provide a concise description of the causes of boiler explosions:\n\n<blockquote>\"The principal causes of explosions, in fact the only causes, are deficiency of strength in the shell or other parts of the boilers, over-pressure and over-heating. Deficiency of strength in steam boilers may be due to original defects, bad workmanship, deterioration from use or mismanagement.\"''<ref>Roper, Stephen (1899). ''Roper's Engineer's Handy Book'' (15th edition) Philadelphia: David McKay (p.207\u2013208)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd:\n\n<blockquote>\"Cause.-Boiler explosions are always due to the fact that some part of the boiler is, for some reason, too weak to withstand the pressure to which it is subjected. This may be due to one of two causes: Either the boiler is not strong enough to safely carry its proper working pressure, or else the pressure has been allowed to rise above the usual point by the sticking of the safety valves, or some similar cause\"''<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) ''Locomotive Boilers'' (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Statione's Hall, London: International Textbook Company</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Early investigations into the causes of boiler explosions ==\nWhile deterioration and mishandling are probably the most common ''causes'' of boiler explosions, the actual ''mechanism'' of a catastrophic boiler failure was not well documented until extensive experimentation was undertaken by U.S. boiler inspectors in the early 20th century. Several different attempts were made to cause a boiler to explode by various means, but one of the most interesting experiments demonstrated that in certain circumstances, if a sudden opening in the boiler allowed steam to escape too rapidly, [[water hammer]] could cause destruction of the entire pressure vessel:\n\n<blockquote>\"A cylindrical boiler was tested and withstood a steam pressure of 300 pounds without injury.\" \" When the [discharge] valve was suddenly opened at a pressure of 235 pounds [{{cvt|235|psi|disp=or||}}] the boiler gave way, the iron being twisted and torn into fragments and thrown in all directions. The reason for this was that the sudden rush of steam from the boiler into the discharge pipe reduced the pressure in the boiler very rapidly. This reduction of pressure caused the sudden formation of a great quantity of steam within the water, and the heavy mass of water being thrown with great violence toward the opening whence the steam was being withdrawn, struck the portions of the boiler near that opening and caused the fracture.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Colliery Engineers Company \u2013 Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59)|last=|first=|publisher=Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=(Sec.12-p.76)}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut the highly destructive mechanism of [[water hammer]] in boiler explosions was understood long before then, as D. K. Clark wrote on 10th February, 1860, in a letter to the editors of \"Mechanics Magazine\":<blockquote>\"The sudden dispersion and projection of the water in the boiler against the bounding surfaces of the boiler is the great cause of the violence of the results: the dispersion, being caused by the momentary generation of steam throughout the mass of the water, and in its efforts to escape, it carries the water before it, and the combined momentum of the steam and the water carries them like shot through and amongst the bounding surfaces, and deforms or shatters them in a manner not to be accounted for by simple overpressure or by simple momentum of steam.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steam boiler explosions|last=Colburn, Zerah, 1832-1870.|date=1873|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|oclc=4741077}}</ref></blockquote>Boiler explosions are common in sinking ships once the superheated boiler touches cold sea water, as the sudden cooling of the superheated metal causes it to crack; for instance, when the {{SS|Benlomond|1922|6}} was torpedoed by a U-boat, the torpedoes and resulting boiler explosion caused the ship to go down in two minutes, leaving [[Poon Lim]] as the only survivor in a complement of 54 crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/2462.html|title=Benlomond (British Steam merchant) \u2013 Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII \u2013 uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~judkins/survival.htm|title=Miracle Survival \u2013 Poon Lim|first=George|last=Judkins|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref>\n\n== Locomotive-type boiler explosions ==\nBoiler explosions are of a particular danger in (locomotive-type) [[fire-tube boiler|fire tube boilers]] because the top of the firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown [[Boiler stay|stays]] to the point of failure, ''even at normal working pressure''.\n\nThis was the cause of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox explosion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SIR9605.pdf|title=STEAM LOCOMOTIVE FIREBOX EXPLOSION ON THE GETTYSBURG RAILROAD NEAR GARDNERS, PENNSYLVANIA JUNE 16, 1995|last=NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD}}</ref> near Gardners, Pennsylvania, in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox. The crown sheet design included several alternating rows of button-head safety stays, which limited the failure of the crown sheet to the first five or six rows of conventional stays, preventing a collapse of the entire crown sheet.\n\nThis type of failure is not limited to railway engines, as locomotive-type boilers have been used for traction engines, portable engines, skid engines used for mining or logging, stationary engines for sawmills and factories, for heating, and as [[package boiler]]s providing steam for other processes. In all applications, maintaining the proper water level is essential for safe operation.\n\n== Principle ==\nMany shell-type boilers carry a large bath of liquid water which is heated to a higher temperature and pressure ([[enthalpy]]) than boiling water would be at atmospheric pressure. During normal operation, the liquid water remains in the bottom of the boiler due to gravity, steam bubbles rise through the liquid water and collect at the top for use until saturation pressure is reached, then the boiling stops. If some pressure is released, boiling begins again, and so on.\n\nIf steam is released normally, say by opening a throttle valve, the bubbling action of the water remains moderate and relatively dry steam can be drawn from the highest point in the vessel.\n\nIf steam is released more quickly, the more vigorous boiling action that results can throw a fine spray of droplets up as \"wet steam\" which can cause damage to piping, engines, turbines and other equipment downstream.\n\nIf a large crack or other opening in the boiler vessel allows the internal pressure to drop very suddenly, the heat energy remaining in the water will cause even more of the liquid to flash into steam bubbles, which then rapidly displace the remaining liquid. The potential energy of the escaping steam and water are now transformed into work, just as they would have done in an engine; with enough force to peel back the material around the break, severely distorting the shape of the plate which was formerly held in place by stays, or self-supported by its original cylindrical shape. The rapid release of steam and water can provide a very potent blast, and cause great damage to surrounding property or personnel.\n\nThe rapidly expanding steam bubbles can also perform work by throwing large \"slugs\" of water inside the boiler in the direction of the opening, and at astonishing velocities. A fast-moving mass of water carries a great deal of kinetic energy (from the expanding steam), and in collision with the shell of the boiler results in a violent destructive effect. This can greatly enlarge the original rupture, or tear the shell in two.<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company (sec.12,p.76)</ref>\n\nMany plumbers, firefighters, and  [[steamfitter]]s are aware of this phenomenon, which is called  \"[[water hammer]]\". A several-ounce \"slug\" of water passing through a steam line at high velocity and striking a 90-degree elbow can instantly fracture a fitting that is otherwise capable of handling several times the normal static pressure. It can then be understood that a few hundred, or even a few thousand pounds of water ''moving at the same velocity'' inside a boiler shell can easily blow out a tube sheet, collapse a firebox, even toss the entire boiler a surprising distance through reaction as the water exits the boiler, like the [[recoil]] of a heavy cannon firing a ball.\n\nSeveral accounts of the [[SL-1]] [[SL-1|experimental reactor accident]] vividly describe the incredibly powerful effect of water hammer on a pressure vessel: <blockquote>\"The expansion caused by this heating process caused water hammer as water was accelerated upwards toward the reactor vessel head, producing approximately 10,000 pounds per square inch (69,000 kPa) of pressure on the head of the reactor vessel when water struck the head at 160 feet per second (50&nbsp;m/s) ...This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000-pound (12,000&nbsp;kg) vessel had jumped 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.id.energy.gov/Foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf|title=IDO-19313 \"ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SL-1 EXCURSION\" November 12, 1962.

Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 508</ref> Since standard pressure saturated water has a specific enthalpy of just {{cvt|418.91|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}},<ref>Milo D. Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 509</ref> the difference between the two specific enthalpies, {{cvt|544.8|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}}, is the total energy expended in the explosion. So in the case of a large locomotive which can hold as much as {{cvt|10000|kg|||}} of water at a high pressure and temperature state, this explosion would have an theoretical energy release equal to about {{convert|1160|kg|||}} of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]].\n\n== Firebox explosions ==\nIn the case of a [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] explosion, these typically occur after a burner [[flameout]]. Oil fumes, natural gas, propane, coal, or any other fuel can build up inside the combustion chamber. This is especially of concern when the vessel is hot; the fuels will rapidly volatize due to the temperature. Once the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) is reached, any source of ignition will cause an explosion of the vapors.\n\nA fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox may damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering structural failure, steam or water leakage, and/or a secondary boiler shell failure and [[steam explosion]].\n\nA common form of minor firebox \"explosion\" is known as \"drumming\" and can occur with any type of fuel. Instead of the normal \"roar\" of the fire, a rhythmic series of \"thumps\" and flashes of fire below the grate and through the [[firedoor]] indicate that the combustion of the fuel is proceeding through a rapid series of detonations, caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture with regard to the level of draft available. This usually causes no damage in locomotive type boilers, but can cause cracks in masonry boiler settings if allowed to continue.\n\n=== Grooving ===\nThe plates of early locomotive boilers were joined by simple [[lap joint|overlapping joints]]. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, along the length of the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), along the length of the joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure.<ref>Hewison (1983: 59 et sec)</ref> It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level.<ref name= CHH15>Hewison (1983: 15)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Thomas|date=1 October 1867|title=On single and double riveted joints|journal=Transactions for 1866|publisher=[[Society of Engineers UK|Society of Engineers]]|location=London|page=150}}</ref> Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or double butt-strap seams, which do not suffer from this defect.\n\nDue to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a similar form of \"stress corrosion\" can take place at the ends of staybolts where they enter the firebox plates, and is accelerated by poor water quality.  Often referred to as [https://www.dli.mn.gov/sites/default/files/image016.jpg \"necking\"], this type of corrosion can reduce the strength of the staybolts until they are incapable of supporting the firebox at normal pressure.\n\nGrooving (deep, localized pitting) also occurs near the waterline, particularly in boilers that are fed with water that has not been de-aerated or treated with oxygen scavenging agents. All \"natural\" sources of water contain dissolved air, which is released as a gas when the water is heated. The air (which contains oxygen) collects in a layer near the surface of the water and greatly accelerates corrosion of the boiler plates in that area.<ref>Graham, Frank D. (1945) \"Audel's Power Plant Engineers guide\" New York, Ny: Theo Audel and Co. (p.332-333, figure 55: \"corrosion along the water line due to air\")</ref>\n\n=== Firebox ===\nThe intricate shape of a locomotive firebox, whether made of soft copper or of steel, can only resist the  steam pressure on its internal walls  if these are supported by [[Firebox (steam engine)#Sheets and stays|stays]] attached to internal girders and the outer walls. They are liable to fail through [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] (because the inner and outer walls expand at different rates under the heat of the fire), from corrosion, or from wasting as  the heads of the  stays exposed to the fire are burned away.

Of the 450 passengers on board more than 250 died, including Henry Clemens, the younger brother of the author [[Mark Twain]].\n\n[[SS Ada Hancock]], a small [[steamboat]] used to transfer passengers and cargo to and from the large coastal [[steamship]]s that stopped in [[San Pedro Harbor]] in the early 1860s, suffered disaster when its boiler exploded violently in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], the port of [[Los Angeles]], near [[Wilmington, California]] on April 27, 1863 killing twenty-six people and injuring many others of the fifty-three or more passengers on board.\n\nThe [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] was destroyed in an explosion on 27 April 1865, resulting in the greatest maritime disaster in [[United States]] history.  An estimated 1,549 passengers were killed when three of the ship's four boilers exploded and the ''Sultana'' burned and sank not far from [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The cause was traced to a poorly executed repair to the shell of one boiler; the patch failed, and debris from that boiler ruptured two more.\n\nAnother US Civil War Steamboat explosion was the Steamer ''Eclipse'' on January 27, 1865, which was carrying members of the [[9th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery|9th Indiana Artillery]]. One official Records report mentions the disaster reports 10 killed and 68 injured;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=/moa/waro/waro0103/&tif=00622.TIF&cite=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ANU4519-0103|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. ; Series 1 \u2013 Volume 49 (Part I)|website=cdl.library.cornell.edu}}</ref> a later report mentions that 27 were killed and 78 wounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=/moa/waro/waro0109/&tif=00722.TIF&cite=http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ANU4519-0109|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. ; Series 1 \u2013 Volume 52 (Part I)|website=cdl.library.cornell.edu}}</ref> Fox's Regimental Losses reports 29 killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/chapt12.htm|title=Fox's Regimental Losses, Chapter 12|website=www.civilwarhome.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n  |url=http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/uninarty.htm#9th\n  |title=9th Indiana Artillery History\n}}</ref>\n\n== Use of boilers ==\nThe [[stationary steam engine]]s used to power machinery first came to prominence during the [[industrial revolution]], and in the early days there were many boiler explosions from a variety of causes. One of the first investigators of the problem was [[William Fairbairn]], who helped establish the first insurance company dealing with the losses such explosions could cause. He also established experimentally that the [[hoop stress]] in a cylindrical pressure vessel like a boiler was twice the [[longitudinal stress]].<ref group=\"notes\">[[William Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s theoretical calculation assumes that the cylindrical vessel is much longer than its diameter. In practice, this is a viable approximation for any boiler that is a [[right cylinder]] or longer. Even for a short, squat boiler such as the [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch]], the reduced end area due to the tubes and their staying effect on the end-plates means that the principal stress is still this hoop stress.</ref> Such investigations helped him and others explain the importance of [[stress concentration]]s in weakening boilers.\n\n== Modern boilers ==\nModern boilers are designed with redundant pumps, valves, water level monitors, fuel cutoffs, automated controls, and pressure [[relief valves]]. In addition, the construction must adhere to strict engineering guidelines set by the relevant authorities. The [[National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors#National Board Inspection Code|NBIC]], [[ASME]], and others attempt to ensure safe boiler designs by publishing detailed standards. The result is a boiler unit which is less prone to catastrophic accidents.\n\nAlso improving safety is the increasing use of \"package boilers.\" These are boilers which are built at a factory then shipped out as a complete unit to the job site.  These typically have better quality and fewer issues than boilers which are site assembled tube-by-tube. A package boiler only needs the final connections to be made (electrical, breaching, condensate lines, etc.) to complete the installation.\n\n== Steam explosions ==\nIn [[steam locomotive]] boilers, as knowledge was gained by [[trial and error]] in early days, the explosive situations and consequent damage due to explosions were inevitable. However, improved design and [[Fire-tube boiler#Maintenance|maintenance]] markedly reduced the number of boiler explosions by the end of the 19th century.  Further improvements continued in the 20th century.\n\nOn land-based boilers, explosions of the pressure systems happened regularly in stationary steam boilers in the [[Victorian era]], but are now very rare because of the various [[Safety|protections]] provided, and because of regular inspections compelled by [[governmental]] and industry requirements.\n\n{{See also|List of boiler explosions}}\n\n[[Water heating|Water heaters]] can [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Exploding Water Heater|explode with surprising violence]] when their safety devices fail.\n\n=== Reactor explosions ===\nA steam explosion can occur in any kind of a water heater, where a sufficient amount of energy is delivered and the steam created exceeds the strength of the vessel. When the heat delivery is sufficiently rapid, a localized superheating can occur, resulting in a water hammer destroying the vessel. The [[SL-1]] nuclear reactor accident is an example of a superheated burst of steam.  However, in the SL1 example the pressure was released by the forced ejection of control rods which allowed the steam to be vented.  The reactor did not explode, nor did the vessel rupture.\n\n== Locomotive boiler explosions in the UK ==\n[[File:Boiler explosion 1850.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of a boiler explosion on a railway locomotive circa 1850.]]\nHewison (1983)<ref>[[#Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions|Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions]]</ref> gives a comprehensive account of British boiler explosions, listing 137 between 1815 and 1962.  It is noteworthy that 122 of these were in the 19th century and only 15 in the 20th century.\n\nBoiler explosions generally fell into two categories.  The first is the breakage of the boiler barrel itself, through weakness/damage or excessive internal pressure, resulting in sudden discharge of steam over a wide area. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] at the [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions, probably caused by [[caustic embrittlement]]. The water used in boilers was not often closely controlled, and if acidic, could corrode the [[wrought iron]] boiler plates. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was an additional problem where [[copper]] and iron were in contact.\nBoiler plates have been thrown up to a quarter of a mile (Hewison, Rolt). The second type is the collapse of the firebox under steam pressure from the adjoining boiler, releasing flames and hot gases into the cab. Improved design and maintenance almost totally eliminated the first type, but the second type is always possible if the engineer and fireman do not maintain the water level in the boiler.\n\nBoiler barrels could explode if the internal pressure became too high.  To prevent this, safety valves were installed to release the pressure at a set level. Early examples were spring-loaded, but [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof valve which was universally adopted. The other common cause of explosions was internal [[corrosion]] which weakened the boiler barrel so that it could not withstand normal operating pressure. In particular, grooves could occur along horizontal seams (lap joints) below water level. Dozens of explosions resulted, but were eliminated by 1900 by the adoption of butt joints, plus improved maintenance schedules and regular hydraulic testing.\n\nFireboxes were generally made of [[copper]], though later locomotives had [[steel]] fireboxes.  They were held to the outer part of the boiler by stays (numerous small supports).  Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening.  The usual cause of firebox collapses is that the boiler water level falls too low and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) becomes uncovered and overheats.  This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the level indicator (gauge glass) is faulty.  A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, two boiler barrel failures and thirteen firebox collapses occurred in the UK. The boiler barrel failures occurred at Cardiff in 1909 and Buxton in 1921; both were caused by misassembly of the [[safety valve]]s causing the boilers to exceed their design pressures. Of the 13 firebox collapses, four were due to broken stays, one to scale buildup on the firebox, and the rest were due to low water level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Steam explosion]]\n* [[Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion|Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE)]]\n* [[Fire-tube boiler#Safety considerations|Boiler safety]]\n* [[Fusible plug]]\n* [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]]\n* [[List of boiler explosions]]\n* [[Lists of rail accidents]]\n* [[William Fairbairn]]\n* [[John Hick (MP)|John Hick]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Christian H. | last=Hewison\n  | year=1983\n  | title=Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=David and Charles\n  | isbn=0-7153-8305-1\n  |ref=Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=L.T.C. | last=Rolt\n  | authorlink=\n  | date=1956 (and later editions)\n  | title=Red for Danger\n  | edition=\n  | publisher= Bodley Head / David and Charles / Pan Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Alan | last=McEwen\n  | year=2009\n  | title=Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=Sledgehammer Engineering Press\n  | isbn=978-0-9532725-2-5\n  |ref=McEwen, Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bartrip, P.W.J.

Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"columns\". While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. After a column lands, if three or more of the same symbols are connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity.

This version was slightly different from the [[Sega Genesis]] version and its soundtrack was transposed and rearranged due to the limitations of the handheld's sound chip. While the columns themselves were updated for the Genesis version, the overall decoration was less like a cartoon in the Game Gear version and instead more artistically designed. Lastly, the Game Gear version had a feature that let the player change the jewels to fruit, squares, dice, or card shapes (clubs, diamonds, spades).\n\nMany [[sequel]]s and spin-offs were produced: ''[[Columns II|Columns II: The Voyage Through Time]]'', ''[[Columns III|Columns III: Revenge of Columns]]'', ''[[Columns '97]]'', ''[[Sakura Taisen: Hanagumi Taisen Columns]] 1 & 2'', and many compilations and re-releases (''Columns Arcade Collection'', ''[[Sega Ages#Sega Ages (Sega Saturn)|Sega Ages Vol. 07: Columns]]'') as well. Because ''Columns'' was made by [[Sega]], versions were made available on the [[Master System]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]]. Additional versions of the game have also been made available on [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[PlayStation 2]].

This version was slightly different from the [[Sega Genesis]] version and its soundtrack was transposed and rearranged due to the limitations of the handheld's sound chip. While the columns themselves were updated for the Genesis version, the overall decoration was less like a cartoon in the Game Gear version and instead more artistically designed. Lastly, the Game Gear version had a feature that let the player change the jewels to fruit, squares, dice, or card shapes (clubs, diamonds, spades).\n\nMany [[sequel]]s and spin-offs were produced: ''[[Columns II|Columns II: The Voyage Through Time]]'', ''[[Columns III|Columns III: Revenge of Columns]]'', ''[[Columns '97]]'', ''[[Sakura Taisen: Hanagumi Taisen Columns]] 1 & 2'', and many compilations and re-releases (''Columns Arcade Collection'', ''[[Sega Ages#Sega Ages (Sega Saturn)|Sega Ages Vol. 07: Columns]]'') as well. Because ''Columns'' was made by [[Sega]], versions were made available on the [[Master System]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]]. Additional versions of the game have also been made available on [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[PlayStation 2]]. A [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] version was released in Japan via the [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power]] service.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n03/sf/npnew/pdf/bclj.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406031312/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n03/sf/npnew/pdf/bclj.pdf |archive-date=2004-04-06 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Game Boy Color]] version was specifically called ''Columns GB: [[Osamu Tezuka]] Characters'', where it featured many of his characters such as [[Kimba the White Lion|Kimba]] and [[Astroboy]], but also featured slightly less known characters such as [[Unico]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nOn November 7, 2006, ''Columns'' was released as part of the game ''[[Sega Genesis Collection]]'' for the PlayStation 2, and later on another release of the above compilation for [[PlayStation Portable]].

{"title_page": "Vesting", "text_new": "{{about||the garment|Vest}}\n\nIn [[law]], '''vesting''' is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment.  One has a '''vested right''' to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset.  When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a '''vested interest'''.\n\nThe concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are [[inheritance]] law and [[retirement plan]] law. In real estate, '''to vest''' is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else's property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one's right to an [[easement]] becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.\n\n==Inheritance==\nSome [[bequest]]s do not vest immediately upon death of the [[testator]]. For example, many [[Will (law)|will]]s specify that an [[heir]] who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nIt is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the [[Remainder (law)|remainder]] to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be [[Remainder (law)#Contingent remainder|contingent]]. This may happen with [[Fee tail|entail]]ed [[Estate (law)|estate]]s, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See [[trust law]] for details).\n\n==Employment==\n\n===Retirement plans===\nVesting is an issue in conjunction with [[employer]] contributions to an [[employee stock option]] plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a [[401(k)]], [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] or [[pension]] plan.\n\nA '''vested right''' is \"an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account\".<ref>[http://lectlaw.com/def2/u032.htm Lectric Law Dictionary]</ref> It is a \"basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away\"; for example. one has a right to a vested [[pension]].<ref>Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 577 (1991).</ref>\n\nGenerally, the portion ''vested'' cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined [[pro-rata]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nGenerally, for retirement plans in the [[United States]], employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception.  For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as ''cliff vesting''. Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as ''graduated vesting''.\n\nChoosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.\n\n===Ownership in startup companies===\nSmall entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of [[common stock]] or positions in an [[employee stock option]] plan to employees and other key participants such as [[independent contractor|contractors]], [[board of directors|board members]], [[Advisory board|advisors]] and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.\n\nVesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.\n\nCommon stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different.  An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a [[Repurchase agreement|repurchase]] right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3\u20135 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a [[pro-rata]] monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://slicingpie.com/bootstrapper-equity-why-time-based-vesting-is-a-waste-of-time/|title=Perfect Equity Splits for Bootstrapped Startups|work=Slicing Pie|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.\n\n=== Profit sharing plans ===\n\n[[Profit-sharing]] plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.\n\n== Vested rights doctrine in zoning law ==\nThe '''vested rights doctrine''' is the rule of [[zoning]] law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a [[building permit]] or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.\n\n== Vesting arrangements and terminology==\n\nA \"vesting period\" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.\n\nIn many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting.  When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered \"partly vested\".\n\nIn cases of partial vesting, a \"vesting schedule\" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period.  Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.\n\nSome arrangements provide for \"accelerated vesting\", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. \"Graded vesting\" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be \"uniform\" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or \"non-uniform\" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graded-vesting.asp#ixzz20GyLrEjY Graded Vesting]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Doctrine of worthier title]]\n* [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA)\n* [[Future interest]]\n* [[Pro-rata]]\n* [[Remainder (law)]]\n* [[Vested Property Act (Bangladesh)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tiaa-cref.org/advisors/403b/403b_vesting.html TIAA CREF discussion of vesting]\n\n[[Category:Labour law]]\n[[Category:Property law]]\n[[Category:Inheritance]]\n[[Category:Wills and trusts]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the garment|Vest}}\n\nIn [[law]], '''vesting''' is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment.

This has led to the burgeoning field of [[transformation optics]] (and now [[transformation acoustics]]), where the propagation of waves is precisely manipulated by controlling the behaviour of the material through which the light (sound) is travelling.\n\n==Ordinary spatial cloaking==\n[[Wave]]s and the host material in which they [[wave propagation|propagate]] have a symbiotic relationship: both act on each other. A simple spatial cloak relies on fine tuning the properties of the propagation medium in order to direct the flow smoothly around an object, like water flowing past a rock in a stream, but without reflection, or without creating turbulence.  Another analogy is that of a flow of cars passing a symmetrical [[traffic island]] \u2013 the cars are temporarily diverted, but can later reassemble themselves into a smooth flow that holds no information about whether the traffic island was small or large, or whether flowers or a large advertising [[billboard]] might have been planted on it.\n\nAlthough both analogies given above have an implied direction (that of the water flow, or of the road orientation), cloaks are often designed so as to be [[isotropic]], i.e. to work equally well for all orientations. However, they do not need to be so general, and might only work in two dimensions, as in the original electromagnetic demonstration, or only from one side, as for the so-called [[Metamaterial cloaking#Broadband ground-plane cloak|carpet cloak]].\n\nSpatial cloaks have other characteristics: whatever they contain can (in principle) be kept invisible forever, since an object inside the cloak may simply remain there. Signals emitted by the objects inside the cloak that are not absorbed can likewise be trapped forever by its internal structure. If a spatial cloak could be turned off and on again at will, the objects inside would then appear and disappear accordingly.\n\n==Space-time cloaking==\nThe event cloak is a means of manipulating electromagnetic radiation in space and time in such a way that a certain collection of happenings, or events, is concealed from distant observers. Conceptually, a safecracker can enter a scene, steal the cash and exit, whilst a surveillance camera records the safe door locked and undisturbed all the time. The concept utilizes the science of metamaterials in which light can be made to behave in ways that are not found in naturally occurring materials.<ref name=EventCloak/>\n\nThe event cloak works by designing a medium in which different parts of the light illuminating a certain region can be either slowed or accelerated. A leading portion of the light is accelerated so that it arrives before the events occur, whilst a trailing part is slowed and arrives too late. After their occurrence, the light is reformed by slowing the leading part and accelerating the trailing part. The distant observer only sees a continuous illumination, whilst the events that occurred during the dark period of the cloak's operation remain undetected. The concept can be related to traffic flowing along a highway: at a certain point some cars are accelerated up, whilst the ones behind are slowed. The result is a temporary gap in the traffic allowing a pedestrian to cross. After this, the process can be reversed so that the traffic resumes its continuous flow without a gap. Regarding the cars as light particles (photons), the act of the pedestrian crossing the road is never suspected by the observer down the highway, who sees an uninterrupted and unperturbed flow of cars.<ref name=EventCloak/><ref>[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/46376 Cloaking space\u2013time]. ''Physics World'' (Jul 7, 2011)</ref>\n\nFor absolute concealment, the events must be non-radiating. If they do emit light during their occurrence (e.g. by fluorescence), then this light is received by the distant observer as a single flash.<ref name=EventCloak/>\n\nApplications of the Event Cloak include the possibility to achieve `interrupt-without-interrupt' in data channels that converge at a node. A primary calculation can be temporarily suspended to process priority information from another channel. Afterwards the suspended channel can be resumed in such a way as to appear as though it was never interrupted.<ref name=EventCloak/>\n\nThe idea of the event cloak was first proposed by a team of researchers at Imperial College London (UK) in 2010, and published in the Journal of Optics.<ref name=EventCloak>\n{{Cite journal |last=McCall |first=M.W. |last2=Favaro |first2=A. |last3=Kinsler |first3=P. |last4=Boardman |first4=A. |year=2011 |title=A spacetime cloak, or a history editor |url=http://www.gurumed.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/A-spacetime-cloak.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Optics (IOP Publishing)|Journal of Optics]] |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=024003 |bibcode=2011JOpt...13b4003M |doi=10.1088/2040-8978/13/2/024003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726134809/http://www.gurumed.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/A-spacetime-cloak.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref> An experimental demonstration of the basic concept using nonlinear optical technology has been presented in a preprint on the Cornell physics [[arXiv]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fridman |first1=M. |last2=Farsi |first2=A. |last3=Okawachi |first3=Y. |last4=Gaeta |first4=A.

This type of cloaking exploits [[resonance]] of [[light]] waves while matching the [[resonance]] of another object. In particular a particle placed near a [[superlens]] would appear to disappear as the light surrounding the particle resonates as the same frequency as the superlens. The resonance would effectively cancel out the light reflecting from the particle, rendering the particle electromagnetically invisible.<ref name=name>{{Cite journal |last=Nicorovici |first=N. |last2=Milton |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=On the cloaking effects associated with anomalous localized resonance |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=462 |issue=2074 |pages=3027\u20133059 |url=http://www.lci.kent.edu/muri/nim_papers/cloaking/2006MiltonTheCloak.pdf |bibcode=2006RSPSA.462.3027M |doi=10.1098/rspa.2006.1715 |accessdate=2010-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040535/http://www.lci.kent.edu/muri/nim_papers/cloaking/2006MiltonTheCloak.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Cloaking objects at a distance== \nIn 2009, a passive cloaking device was designed to be an 'external invisibility device' that leaves the concealed object out in the open so that it can \u2018see\u2019 its surroundings. This is based on the premise that cloaking research has not adequately provided a solution to an inherent problem; because no electromagnetic radiation can enter or leave the cloaked space, this leaves the concealed object of the cloak without ability to detect visually, or otherwise, anything outside the cloaked space.<ref name=ext-clk-2009>{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |title=External invisibility device cloaks objects at a distance |journal=SPIE Newsroom |date=July 2009|doi=10.1117/2.1200907.1720 }}</ref><ref name=ext-clk-2009-journal>{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |last2=Chen |first2=H.

Imagine that a car has broken down in the vicinity of the roundabout, and is disrupting the traffic flow, causing cars to take different routes or creating a [[traffic jam]].  This exterior cloak corresponds to a carefully misshapen roundabout which manages to cancel or counteract the effect of the broken down car \u2013 so that as the traffic flow departs, there is again no evidence in it of either the roundabout or of the broken down car.\n\n==Plasmonic cover==\nThe ''plasmonic cover'', mentioned alongside ''metamaterial covers'' (see [[plasmonic metamaterials]]), theoretically utilizes plasmonic resonance effects to reduce the total scattering cross section of spherical and cylindrical objects. These are lossless metamaterial covers near their plasma resonance which could possibly induce a dramatic drop in the scattering cross section, making these objects nearly \u201cinvisible\u201d or \u201ctransparent\u201d to an outside observer. Low loss, even no-loss, passive covers might be utilized that do not require high dissipation, but rely on a completely different mechanism.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover/>\n\nMaterials with either negative or low value constitutive parameters, are required for this effect. Certain metals near their plasma frequency, or metamaterials with negative parameters could fill this need. For example, several noble metals achieve this requirement because of their electrical permittivity at the infra-red or visible wavelengths with relatively low loss.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover/>\n\nCurrently only microscopically small objects could possibly appear transparent.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover>{{Cite journal |last1=Al\u00f9 |first1=A. |last2=Engheta |first2=N. |year=2005 |title=Achieving transparency with plasmonic and metamaterial coatings |journal=[[Physical Review E]] |volume=72 |issue=|page=016623 |arxiv=cond-mat/0502336 |bibcode=2005PhRvE..72a6623A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.72.016623 |url=https://works.bepress.com/nader_engheta/66/download/ |pmid=16090123}}</ref>\n\nThese materials are further described as a homogeneous, isotropic, metamaterial covers near plasma frequency dramatically reducing the fields scattered by a given object. Furthermore, These do not require any absorptive process, any anisotropy or inhomogeneity, and nor any interference cancellation.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover/>\n\nThe \"classical theory\" of ''metamaterial covers'' works with light of only one specific frequency.\nA new research, of Kort-Kamp ''et al'',<ref>\"[https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5022 Tuning plasmonic cloaks with an external magnetic field]\", W.

Farina.</ref> who won the prize  \u201cSchool on Nonlinear Optics and Nanophotonics\u201d of 2013, shows that is possible to tune the metamaterial to different light frequencies.\n\n==Tunneling light transmission cloak==\nAs implied in the nomenclature, this is a type of light transmission. Transmission of light ([[EM radiation]]) through an object such as metallic film occurs with an assist of tunnelling between resonating inclusions. This effect can be created by embedding a periodic configuration of dielectrics in a metal, for example. By creating and observing transmission peaks interactions between the dielectrics and interference effects cause mixing and splitting of resonances. With an effective permittivity close to unity, the results can be used to propose a method for turning the resulting materials invisible.<ref name=TLTC-1>{{Cite journal |last1=Garcia de Abajo |first=F.

Afterwards the suspended channel can be resumed in such a way as to appear as though it was never interrupted.<ref name=EventCloak/>\n\nThe idea of the event cloak was first proposed by a team of researchers at Imperial College London (UK) in 2010, and published in the Journal of Optics.<ref name=EventCloak>\n{{Cite journal |last=McCall |first=M.W. |last2=Favaro |first2=A. |last3=Kinsler |first3=P. |last4=Boardman |first4=A. |year=2011 |title=A spacetime cloak, or a history editor |url=http://www.gurumed.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/A-spacetime-cloak.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Optics (IOP Publishing)|Journal of Optics]] |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=024003 |bibcode=2011JOpt...13b4003M |doi=10.1088/2040-8978/13/2/024003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726134809/http://www.gurumed.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/A-spacetime-cloak.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref> An experimental demonstration of the basic concept using nonlinear optical technology has been presented in a preprint on the Cornell physics [[arXiv]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fridman |first1=M. |last2=Farsi |first2=A. |last3=Okawachi |first3=Y. |last4=Gaeta |first4=A.

This type of cloaking exploits [[resonance]] of [[light]] waves while matching the [[resonance]] of another object. In particular a particle placed near a [[superlens]] would appear to disappear as the light surrounding the particle resonates as the same frequency as the superlens. The resonance would effectively cancel out the light reflecting from the particle, rendering the particle electromagnetically invisible.<ref name=name>{{Cite journal |last=Nicorovici |first=N. |last2=Milton |first2=G. |year=2006 |title=On the cloaking effects associated with anomalous localized resonance |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=462 |issue=2074 |pages=3027\u20133059 |url=http://www.lci.kent.edu/muri/nim_papers/cloaking/2006MiltonTheCloak.pdf |bibcode=2006RSPSA.462.3027M |doi=10.1098/rspa.2006.1715 |accessdate=2010-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040535/http://www.lci.kent.edu/muri/nim_papers/cloaking/2006MiltonTheCloak.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Cloaking objects at a distance== \nIn 2009, a passive cloaking device was designed to be an 'external invisibility device' that leaves the concealed object out in the open so that it can \u2018see\u2019 its surroundings. This is based on the premise that cloaking research has not adequately provided a solution to an inherent problem; because no electromagnetic radiation can enter or leave the cloaked space, this leaves the concealed object of the cloak without ability to detect visually, or otherwise, anything outside the cloaked space.<ref name=ext-clk-2009>{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |title=External invisibility device cloaks objects at a distance |journal=SPIE Newsroom |date=July 2009|doi=10.1117/2.1200907.1720 }}</ref><ref name=ext-clk-2009-journal>{{cite journal |last1=Lai |first1=Y. |last2=Chen |first2=H.

Imagine that a car has broken down in the vicinity of the roundabout, and is disrupting the traffic flow, causing cars to take different routes or creating a [[traffic jam]].  This exterior cloak corresponds to a carefully misshapen roundabout which manages to cancel or counteract the effect of the broken down car \u2013 so that as the traffic flow departs, there is again no evidence in it of either the roundabout or of the broken down car.\n\n==Plasmonic cover==\nThe ''plasmonic cover'', mentioned alongside ''metamaterial covers'' (see [[plasmonic metamaterials]]), theoretically utilizes plasmonic resonance effects to reduce the total scattering cross section of spherical and cylindrical objects. These are lossless metamaterial covers near their plasma resonance which could possibly induce a dramatic drop in the scattering cross section, making these objects nearly \u201cinvisible\u201d or \u201ctransparent\u201d to an outside observer. Low loss, even no-loss, passive covers might be utilized that do not require high dissipation, but rely on a completely different mechanism.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover/>\n\nMaterials with either negative or low value constitutive parameters, are required for this effect. Certain metals near their plasma frequency, or metamaterials with negative parameters could fill this need. For example, several noble metals achieve this requirement because of their electrical permittivity at the infra-red or visible wavelengths with relatively low loss.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover/>\n\nCurrently only microscopically small objects could possibly appear transparent.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover>{{Cite journal |last1=Al\u00f9 |first1=A. |last2=Engheta |first2=N. |year=2005 |title=Achieving transparency with plasmonic and metamaterial coatings |journal=[[Physical Review E]] |volume=72 |issue=|page=016623 |arxiv=cond-mat/0502336 |bibcode=2005PhRvE..72a6623A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.72.016623 |url=https://works.bepress.com/nader_engheta/66/download/ |pmid=16090123}}</ref>\n\nThese materials are further described as a homogeneous, isotropic, metamaterial covers near plasma frequency dramatically reducing the fields scattered by a given object. Furthermore, These do not require any absorptive process, any anisotropy or inhomogeneity, and nor any interference cancellation.<ref name=Plasmonic-cover/>\n\nThe \"classical theory\" of ''metamaterial covers'' works with light of only one specific frequency.\nA new research, of Kort-Kamp ''et al'',<ref>\"[https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5022 Tuning plasmonic cloaks with an external magnetic field]\", W.

Transmission of light ([[EM radiation]]) through an object such as metallic film occurs with an assist of tunnelling between resonating inclusions. This effect can be created by embedding a periodic configuration of dielectrics in a metal, for example. By creating and observing transmission peaks interactions between the dielectrics and interference effects cause mixing and splitting of resonances. With an effective permittivity close to unity, the results can be used to propose a method for turning the resulting materials invisible.<ref name=TLTC-1>{{Cite journal |last1=Garcia de Abajo |first=F.

The settlement was initially known as Sidney or Sydney Bay, and by 1796 was being called the Town of Sydney,<ref>'View of the Town of Sydney, Norfolk Island', 1796, watercolour by WN Chapman, in Hoare, op.cit., plate 2</ref> in honour of [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], British [[Home Secretary]] and patron of the [[First Fleet]]. King established a house on the hill over the town, but the mass of roots in the ground caused him to call it \"rooty hill\",<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Rooty+Hill+Rd,+Kingston,+Norfolk+Island&hl=en&ll=-29.052099,167.96628&spn=0.014293,0.019033&geocode=FT62RP4dlvgCCg&hnear=Rooty+Hill+Rd,+Kingston,+Norfolk+Island&t=h&z=16 Rooty Hill Road, Kingston, Norfolk Island], [[Google Maps]], accessed 7 March 2013</ref> which name was also later transferred to [[Rooty Hill, New South Wales]] when King later established a house there.\n\n== Urban form ==\nThe [[old town]] dating from 1788 occupies several winding irregular lanes at the head of Kingston Pier.  The modern town, as laid out by the [[Royal Engineers]] during the 1830s, consists of a Roman-style [[grid plan]].  There are two long east west roads: Bay Street along the foreshore and Quality Row, the town's principal thoroughfare, along the foothills.  These two [[boulevard]]s are connected by short cross streets of Pier Street,  Bounty Street and the former Bligh Street (now part of the drive to [[Government House, Norfolk Island|Government House]]).<ref>Baskerville, Bruce, 'Kingston: one of the South Pacific's oldest colonial towns', ''2899 Norfolk Island Lifestyle Magazine'', Vol 2, Issue 2, 2010: 47\u201352</ref>  Small stone bridges carry these streets across Watermill Creek.  Four roads wind up country from the edges of the grid: Country Road, Middlegate Road, Rooty Hill Road and Driver Christian Road.  All the buildings are located either in the [[old town]] or along Quality Row, with the exception of Government House which is located on a small [[hillock|knoll]] called Dove's Plot Hill.  The middle and west of the plain forms the Kingston [[common land|Common]] and Kingston Recreation Ground, with the [[links (golf)|golf links]] occupying the eastern end, and Kingston [[Cemetery]] in the north-east.  This broad [[grassland|greensward]] with the Kingston [[swamp]] in its centre separates the two long boulevards.\n\n== Municipal governance ==\nThere is no level of [[municipality|municipal]] governance in Norfolk Island, and the [[town]] has no formal boundaries.  Municipal functions such as rubbish collection and maintaining public toilets and beachside change rooms are undertaken by the [[Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area]] Conservation & Maintenance Team.  The town has no distinctive emblems or civic [[heraldry]].\n\n== Nearby towns and hamlets==\nThe town of [[Burnt Pine]] is about {{convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} to the north-west, and the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Middlegate is about {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} to the north.  The uninhabited [[Nepean Island (Norfolk Island)|Nepean Island]] and [[Phillip Island (Norfolk Island)|Phillip Island]] dominate the sea view from Kingston.\n\n== World Heritage Area ==\nKingston is in the centre of the [[Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area]], which was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] on 31 July 2010 as one of the group of eleven [[Australian Convict Sites]].\n\n== Notable sites in Kingston and nearby ==\n* [[Causeway]] to [[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]] wrecksite, 1790 (exposed at low tide)\n* Marine Barracks 1792, now Civil Hospital ruins 1831\n* Swamp Canal 1795\n* Stone building 1796, now the Guardhouse 1826\n* Government House 1804\n* Piper's Boatshed 1808, now the Double Boatshed 1826\n* Kingston Cemetery 1825\n* Commissariat Granary 1827, now the Crankmill ruin\n* Prisoner's Barracks 1829, now the Compound 1960s\n* The Officer's Bath 1832\n* Old Military Barracks 1832, now the Legislative Assembly 1979\n* Bounty Street Bridge 1832\n* Pier Street Bridge 1834\n* Commissariat Store 1835, now All Saints Church 1874\n* New Military Barracks 1836, now the Administration Offices 1926\n* Kingston Pier 1839\n* New Gaol ruins 1847\n* Salt House ruins 1848\n* Royal Engineer's Office 1851, now REO Cafe 1984\n* Queen Elizabeth Lookout 1974\n* Kingston Common\n* Emily Bay\n* Slaughter Bay\n* Cemetery Bay\n* Lone Pine and Point Hunter\n* Flagstaff Hill\n* Arthur's Vale<ref>Smith, Nan, ''Convict Kingston: a guide'', Nan Smith, Norfolk Island 1997</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Norfolk Island jetty2.jpg|Kingston Pier, with launch towing a lighter with cargo from ship moored off-shore\nFile:Norfolk Island Kingston.jpg|Old lighters at the Kingston boatsheds\nFile:Norfolk Island jetty.jpg|Crane on Kingston Pier unloading cargo from a lighter\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143228/http://www.kavha.gov.nf/ Kingston and Arthurs Vale Historic Area]\n*[http://www.pitcairners.org/vt_kingston.html Kingston]\n\n{{List of Oceanian capitals by region}}\n\n[[Category:Kingston, Norfolk Island| ]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Norfolk Island]]\n[[Category:Capitals in Oceania]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1788]]\n[[Category:1788 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox Australian place\n| type                     = town\n| name                     = Kingston\n| state                    = ni\n| image                    = Norfolk Island jail1.jpg\n| caption                  = Old Military Barracks, now Legislative Assembly Chambers, with Kingston Common in background\n| image_alt                = Old Military Barracks, now Legislative Assembly Chambers, with Kingston Common in background\n| coordinates              = {{coord|29|3|S|167|58|E|display=inline,title}}\n| pop                      = \n| pop_year                 = \n| pop_footnotes            = \n| density                  = \n| density_footnotes        = \n| est                      = 6 March 1788\n| postcode                 = 2899\n| elevation                = \n| elevation_footnotes      = \n| area                     = \n| area_footnotes           = \n| timezone                 = NFT\n| utc                      = +11\n| timezone-dst             = \n| utc-dst                  = \n| dist1                    = 3\n| dir1                     = SE\n| location1                = Burnt Pine\n| dist2                    = 2\n| dir2                     = S\n| location2                = Middlegate\n| stategov                 = \n| fedgov                   = \n| maxtemp                  = \n| maxtemp_footnotes        = \n| mintemp                  = \n| mintemp_footnotes        = \n| rainfall                 = \n| rainfall_footnotes       = \n| near-n                   = \n| near-ne                  = \n| near-e                   = \n| near-se                  = \n| near-s                   = \n| near-sw                  = \n| near-w                   = \n| near-nw                  = \n| near                     = \n}}\n'''Kingston''' ([[Norfuk language|Norf'k laengwij]] ''Daun a'Taun''<ref name=\"Buffett\">Buffett, Alice Inez, ''Speak Norfolk Today: An Encyclopedia of the Norfolk Island language'', Himii Publishing, Norfolk Island 1999: 24</ref>) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Australia]]n [[Oceania|South Pacific]] Territory of [[Norfolk Island]].  The vice-regal, legislative, administrative and judicial offices are all located in Kingston. The town is the second-oldest in Australia, founded a little over a month after [[Sydney]].\n\n==Geography==\nKingston is located on the east-west aligned Kingston Plain which rises from the coast to about {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level in the [[foothill]]s of the Kingston [[escarpment]].  The [[plain]] is {{convert|1.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long by about {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, with calcareous lime sands to the south along the coast and basaltic clays to the north along the foothills.   The western end of the plain is marked by the {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high Flagstaff Hill.  Watermill Creek traverses the plain after leaving Arthur's Vale to the north-west, and is joined by Town Creek and several minor tributaries to form the Kingston swamps before draining into Emily Bay.  Most of the accessible beaches on the island are located along the Kingston foreshores.  Southwards, Emily Bay and Slaughter Bay open into the Kingston [[lagoon]] and [[reef]]s and the broad expanse of Sydney Bay.  Eastwards, Cemetery Bay opens directly into the [[South Pacific Ocean]].\n\n== History ==\nThe town was founded on 6 March 1788 by Lieutenant [[Philip Gidley King]] and 22 settlers (including 9 male and 6 female convicts) who landed that day from HMT ''Supply''.<ref>Hoare, Merval, ''Norfolk Island: a revised and enlarged history 1774\u20131998'', CQUP, Rockhampton 2003 (5th ed): 9\u201310</ref>  They had sailed from [[Port Jackson]]  just a few weeks after the establishment of the [[United Kingdom|British]] colony of [[New South Wales]].

It features an advanced physics, suspension, and tire model.\n\nIn September 2016, the developers announced a partnership with Dutch software company [[Luminis (software company)|Luminis]] with the goal of bringing new features to the software.<ref name=VirtualRStudio397>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualr.net/studio-397-take-rfactor-2-development|title=Studio 397 To Take Over rFactor 2 Development|date=3 October 2016|accessdate=7 October 2016|website=VirtualR}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the initial success of ''[[Sports Car GT]]'' (1999), [[Image Space Incorporated]] used its self-developed software engine isiMotor1 for a number of racing titles, including the highly praised Formula One simulators ''[[EA Sports F1 2002|F1 2002]]'' and ''[[F1 Challenge '99-'02]]''. isiMotor is an umbrella term that covers every component of the software engine, for example the graphics engine gMotor, the physics engine pMotor and so on.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAfter the release of ''F1 Challenge '99-'02'', [[ISImotor|isiMotor]] was licensed to another company for the first time, [[SimBin]], who went on to produce popular retail sim racing titles based on Image Space Incorporated's engine, including ''[[GTR \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR]]'' and ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR 2]]''.\n\nImage Space Incorporated then decided to make a racing simulator with an open architecture and provided tools for the modding community to create third party content. This title became ''rFactor'' which was the first ISI release using the software engine referred to as isiMotor2. ''rFactor'' went on to become the preferred racing simulation platform for nearly a decade, with a plethora of community created content. ''rFactor 2'' is also being used to train the drivers who win the [[GT Academy (competition)|Gran Turismo Academy]] competition.<ref name=TechRadar/><ref name=GtAcademy/>\n\nisiMotor2 was further licensed to companies such as [[Slightly Mad Studios]], [[Reiza Studios]] and [[2Pez Games]]. isiMotor2 also laid the foundation for ''rFactor Pro'', a software simulation engine used by real life racing teams and car manufacturers including most of the current Formula One grid and NASCAR manufacturers. Image Space Incorporated took the experience from isiMotor2 and ''rFactor Pro'' and began the development of ''rFactor 2''. From this point on, the software engine would be referred to as isiMotor2.5.\n\nThe editor from the sim racing site VirtualR stated: \"It took me some time to see it but I do recognise rF2 as the best racing sim out there for the serious players\".<ref name=SeriousSim>{{cite web|title=Endurance Series for rFactor 2 \u2013 First Previews|url=http://www.virtualr.net/endurance-series-rfactor-2-first-previews#comment-2090111946|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Physics ==\n''rFactor 2'' and its precursor have received much praise for its highly advanced and accurate simulation of vehicle dynamics and is the preferred simulator for most real life professional racing teams, car engineers and simulation centers.\n\nRace Engineer Andrea Quintarelli stated: \"It is also no surprise for me that most of these professional simulators (or centers) are using ''rFactor''. As I had the chance to prove myself (and probably to somebody reading here), when you know how to properly build your models, ''rFactor'' is producing very accurate results, at a very low cost\".<ref name=DrrCareer/>\n\nPetros Mak, founder of the professional modding company Mak Corp, stated: \"All our race team clients and even our series clients, they don't only use ''rFactor'' for track familiarization. They also use it to test setup data before they go to an event, they use it to test potential new part data, by developing new brakes or new engine performances and testing it in the game before they actually commit to building it in real life.

This partnership brings the development of ''rFactor 2'' in a new company called Studio 397. Studio 397 managing director Marcel Offermans stated that a lot of new features will be implemented in the game, including a more web-based UI, a [[DirectX#DirectX 11|DirectX 11]] compatible graphics engine and the [[Virtual reality|VR]] support for [[Oculus Rift]] and [[HTC Vive]].

The developers announced they have acquired the license of [[U.S. F2000 National Championship]], [[Radical Sportscars]] and [[NOLA Motorsports Park]]. The new ''rFactor 2'' version will be available only on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualr.net/studio-397-reveals-first-rfactor-2-development-roadmap|title=Studio 397 Reveals First rFactor 2 Development Roadmap|date=23 October 2016|accessdate=25 October 2016|website=VirtualR}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\n=== Cars ===\nAs with its predecessor, many default vehicles are available to download. The long list of cars includes [[Formula One car]]s, [[Grand tourer|GT cars]], touring cars, [[Stock car racing|stock cars]] and [[van]]s. There are also [[All-terrain vehicle|quads]] and [[Radio-controlled car|Formula RC cars]] available as experimental content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rfactor.net/web/rf2/cars/|title=FREE ADD-ON CARS|accessdate=7 October 2016|website=rFactor Official Website}}</ref>\n\n=== Tracks ===\nA list of default tracks is available but not all of them are licensed. The range of racing venues includes permanent, oval, rally, and street circuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rfactor.net/web/rf2/tracks/|title=FREE ADD-ON TRACKS|accessdate=7 October 2016|website=rFactor Official Website}}</ref>\n\n=== Real Road ===\nReal Road is one of the most prominent features of ''rFactor 2''. Rubber is dynamically laid on the track surface in real time during a race session by the player and the AI. The rubber can carry over to the next sessions and this calls for the player to constantly having to adapt to the advancing track conditions during a race weekend which in a dry race weekend means more and more available grip throughout. The player can choose from various rubber presets to start with or just choose to start the weekend on a completely green track. Real Road can be accelerated, left at a normal rate, or be completely static. The feature also creates grip-affecting marbles outside of the normal racing line.\n\nReal Road also works together with wet weather. When rain hits the track, the previously built-up rubber and marbles is washed away and the track will then need to be rubbered in again. The wet track surface dries dynamically similar to the aforementioned rubber build-up due to both cars on track as well as temperature, sun and wind. The Real Road system of ''rFactor 2'' is unique because it is not scripted, but completely dynamic.<ref name=RealRoad/>\n\n=== Tires ===\n''rFactor 2'' also features realistic tire wear and damage. This punishes the player for locking up the brakes because a flatspot will occur with force feedback vibrations (tire suddenly has edges instead of being perfectly round) and a car imbalance (due to the lost weight of the burnt off tire). Until the tires are changed during a pit stop, the car will feel imbalanced and uncomfortable to drive. Using bad driving techniques will also punish the player with tires overheating and wearing unevenly. Tire punctures are also featured though not visually represented in-game.\n\n=== AI ===\nThe AI of ''rFactor 2'' is highly advanced and much improved over the first ''rFactor''. It has spatial awareness, adjustable strength and aggression sliders and has the ability to \"learn\" better racing lines around a track resulting in better lap times. The AI can also be allowed to take control over the player's car. ''rFactor 2'' is unique in that it is capable of races with over 100 AI opponents<ref name=HundredAI>{{cite web|title=rFactor 2 \u2013 102 cars at the Nordschleife\u2026 At once!|url=http://www.bsimracing.com/rfactor-2-102-cars-at-the-nordschleife-at-once/|website=BSimRacing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> and you can also mix AI opponents with real drivers during online multiplayer races.\n\n=== Other features ===\nAlso featured in ''rFactor 2'' is a full day-to-night cycle with lighting transitions which can be set to real-time or accelerated. Fuel usage and visual as well as mechanical damage are also featured in the simulator, along with a \"resume from replay\" feature where any saved replay can be loaded and the player can then choose to resume driving at any point during that replay.\n\n=== Modding ===\n''rFactor 2'' is designed specifically to be modded. It is the first race sim with a dedicated mod packaging system and with the Steam release it will be the first with Steam Workshop integration.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://store.steampowered.com/app/365960/rFactor_2/ Official Steam website]\n* [https://www.studio-397.com/ Studio 397 official website]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/simracingforlife SrFL rFactor 2 community]\n\n{{Image Space Incorporated games}}\n\n[[Category:2013 video games]]\n[[Category:Image Space Incorporated games]]\n[[Category:Racing simulators]]\n[[Category:Racing video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2016}}\n{{advert|date=September 2017}}\n{{update|date=November 2017}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''rFactor 2''}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = ''rFactor 2''\n| italic title = no\n| image        =\n| caption      =\n| developer    = [[Image Space Incorporated]]<br>Studio 397 (from 2016)\n| publisher    = [[Image Space Incorporated]]\n| director     =\n| producer     =\n| designer     = [[Image Space Incorporated]]\n| programmer   =\n| artist       =\n| writer       =\n| composer     =\n| series       =\n| engine       = [[ISImotor|isiMotor 2.5]]\n| platforms    = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| released     = {{Video game release|NA|2013}}\n| genre        = [[Sim racing|Racing simulation]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n}}\n'''''rFactor 2''''' is a [[personal computer|computer]] [[racing simulator]] developed by the American independent software firm [[Image Space Incorporated]] and released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] in 2013.

It features an advanced physics, suspension, and tire model.\n\nIn September 2016, the developers announced a partnership with Dutch software company [[Luminis (software company)|Luminis]] with the goal of bringing new features to the software.<ref name=VirtualRStudio397>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualr.net/studio-397-take-rfactor-2-development|title=Studio 397 To Take Over rFactor 2 Development|date=3 October 2016|accessdate=7 October 2016|website=VirtualR}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the initial success of ''[[Sports Car GT]]'' (1999), [[Image Space Incorporated]] used its self-developed software engine isiMotor1 for a number of racing titles, including the highly praised Formula One simulators ''[[EA Sports F1 2002|F1 2002]]'' and ''[[F1 Challenge '99-'02]]''. isiMotor is an umbrella term that covers every component of the software engine, for example the graphics engine gMotor, the physics engine pMotor and so on.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAfter the release of ''F1 Challenge '99-'02'', [[ISImotor|isiMotor]] was licensed to another company for the first time, [[SimBin]], who went on to produce popular retail sim racing titles based on Image Space Incorporated\u2019s engine, including ''[[GTR \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR]]'' and ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR 2]]''.\n\nImage Space Incorporated then decided to make a racing simulator with an open architecture and provided tools for the modding community to create third party content. This title became ''rFactor'' which was the first ISI release using the software engine referred to as isiMotor2. ''rFactor'' went on to become the preferred racing simulation platform for nearly a decade, with a plethora of community created content. ''rFactor 2'' is also being used to train the drivers who win the [[GT Academy (competition)|Gran Turismo Academy]] competition.<ref name=TechRadar/><ref name=GtAcademy/>\n\nisiMotor2 was further licensed to companies such as [[Slightly Mad Studios]], [[Reiza Studios]] and [[2Pez Games]]. isiMotor2 also laid the foundation for ''rFactor Pro'', a software simulation engine used by real life racing teams and car manufacturers including most of the current Formula One grid and NASCAR manufacturers. Image Space Incorporated took the experience from isiMotor2 and ''rFactor Pro'' and began the development of ''rFactor 2''. From this point on, the software engine would be referred to as isiMotor2.5.\n\nThe editor from the sim racing site VirtualR stated: \"It took me some time to see it but I do recognise rF2 as the best racing sim out there for the serious players\".<ref name=SeriousSim>{{cite web|title=Endurance Series for rFactor 2 \u2013 First Previews|url=http://www.virtualr.net/endurance-series-rfactor-2-first-previews#comment-2090111946|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Physics ==\n''rFactor 2'' and its precursor have received much praise for its highly advanced and accurate simulation of vehicle dynamics and is the preferred simulator for most real life professional racing teams, car engineers and simulation centers.\n\nRace Engineer Andrea Quintarelli stated: \"It is also no surprise for me that most of these professional simulators (or centers) are using ''rFactor''. As I had the chance to prove myself (and probably to somebody reading here), when you know how to properly build your models, ''rFactor'' is producing very accurate results, at a very low cost\".<ref name=DrrCareer/>\n\nPetros Mak, founder of the professional modding company Mak Corp, stated: \"All our race team clients and even our series clients, they don't only use ''rFactor'' for track familiarization. They also use it to test setup data before they go to an event, they use it to test potential new part data, by developing new brakes or new engine performances and testing it in the game before they actually commit to building it in real life. ''rF1'' and ''rF2'' provide far higher accuracy for those things than any other simulation on the market.

This task is carried out by the [[European Committee for Standardization|Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation]] (CEN) (European Committee for Standardization).\n\n==European standard steel grades==\n\n[[File:EN10027-steelgrade-diagram.svg|thumb|EN 10027-1 steel grade designation system.]]\n\nEuropean standard steel grade names fall into two categories:<ref>{{Citation | title = EN 10027  | publisher = European committee for standardisation }}</ref>\n# Steel specified by purpose of use and mechanical properties.\n# Steel specified by chemical composition.\n\nThe inclusion of a letter 'G' before the code indicates the steel is specified in the form of a casting.\n\n===Category 1===\nBasic grade designations for category 1 steels consist of a single letter (designating application) then a number signifying the mechanical property (often yield strength) dictated in the standard for that application designation. For some application designations another letter is included before the property value, this number is used to indicate any special requirements or conditions. These additional letters and values depend entirely on the application of the steel and are specified in the standard and far too numerous to mention here.\n\nThe next set of 3 digits gives the steel's minimum yield strength. So S355 has a minimum yield strength of 355 MPa for the smallest thickness range covered by the relevant standard \u2013 i.e. EN10025.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakleysteel.co.uk/thick-steel-plates/steel-information/guide-en-10027-steel-names|title=EN 10027 Steel Names and their Meaning|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a table indicating the most common application codes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These values depend solely on the type/application code given in the first part of the code and are so numerous as to be impossible to indicate here. Additional symbols are separated from the main code by the plus sign (+).\n\nThe most common additional symbols are the impact and temperature codes for structural steels, category 1 - Sxxx.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Impact Resistance\n! colspan=\"2\" | Temperature\n|-\n!

For some application designations another letter is included before the property value, this number is used to indicate any special requirements or conditions. These additional letters and values depend entirely on the application of the steel and are specified in the standard and far too numerous to mention here.\n\nThe next set of 3 digits gives the steel's minimum yield strength. So S355 has a minimum yield strength of 355 MPa for the smallest thickness range covered by the relevant standard \u2013 i.e. EN10025.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakleysteel.co.uk/thick-steel-plates/steel-information/guide-en-10027-steel-names|title=EN 10027 Steel Names and their Meaning|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a table indicating the most common application codes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These values depend solely on the type/application code given in the first part of the code and are so numerous as to be impossible to indicate here. Additional symbols are separated from the main code by the plus sign (+).\n\nThe most common additional symbols are the impact and temperature codes for structural steels, category 1 - Sxxx.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Impact Resistance\n! colspan=\"2\" | Temperature\n|-\n!
