It is the state's [[List of cities in Bihar by population|second-largest]] city, with a population of 470,839, and is the headquarters of [[Gaya district]] and [[Magadh division]]. The city is surrounded on three sides by small, rocky hills ([[Mangla Gauri|Mangla-Gauri]], Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila, and Brahmayoni), with the [[Phalgu|Phalgu River]] on its fourth (eastern) side.\n\nGaya is sanctified in the [[Jain]], [[Hindu]], and [[Buddhist]] religions. Gaya district is mentioned in the great epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. It is the place where [[Rama]], with [[Sita]] and [[Lakshmana]], came to offer [[Pinda (riceball)|pind-daan]] for their father, Dasharath, and continues to be a major Hindu pilgrimage site for the pind-daan ritual. [[Bodh Gaya]], where [[Buddha]] is said to have attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and is one of the four holy sites of [[Buddhism]]. The [[Mahabodhi Temple]] complex at Bodh Gaya is a [[World Heritage site]].\n\n==Etymology==\nGaya is one of the best historical sites in India. Gaya is named after the demon ''Gayasur'' (meaning \"the demon Gaya\"). According to [[Vayu Purana]], Gaya was the name of a demon ([[Asura]]) whose body became pious after he performed strict penance and secured blessings from Lord [[Vishnu]].<ref name=MSME /> It was said that the body of Gayasura was transformed into the series of rocky hills that make up the landscape of Gaya.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harekrsna.com/philosophy/associates/demons/vishnu/gayasur.htm |title=The Hare Krsnas - Battles of Vishnu Avatars - Gayasur |publisher=Harekrsna.com |accessdate=2016-01-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115138/http://www.harekrsna.com/philosophy/associates/demons/vishnu/gayasur.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gayasisa1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Brahmayoni Hill, where Buddha preached the ''[[Fire Sermon|Adittapariyaya Sutta]]'' (the ''Fire Sermon'').]]\n\n===Ancient history===\nAccording to modern scholars, the [[Kikata Kingdom|Kikata kingdom]] from rigvedic period was located at Gaya, Bihar.\n\nGaya is an ancient city, with a Buddhist documented history dating back to the 6th century BCE when the sage [[Gautama Buddha]] attained enlightenment at [[Bodh Gaya]], {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from the modern city, and became the [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]].<ref name=\"Nomination\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/1056rev.pdf |title=World Heritage Scanned Nomination - Site Name: Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya |last=World Heritage Committee |website=www.whc.unesco.org |date=29 June 2002 |access-date=27 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\nEven before this time, Gaya was a place of pilgrimage for people from around the world.

During this period, Gaya witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties in the [[Magadha]] region, where it occupied an important place in cultural history over some 2,400 years between the 6th century BCE and the 18th century CE.\n\nThe city's cultural significance began with the dynasty founded by Sisunaga, who exercised power over Patna and Gaya around 600 BCE. [[Bimbisara]], fifth king of the dynasty, who lived and ruled around 519 BCE, had projected Gaya to the outer world. Having attained an important place in the history of civilization, the area experienced the influence of Gautama Buddha and Bhagwan Mahavir during the reign of Bimbisara. After a brief period under the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda dynasty]] (345\u2013321 BCE), Gaya and the entire Magadha region came under Mauryan rule. Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]] (272\u2013232 BCE) embraced and promoted Buddhism. He visited Gaya, and built the first temple at Bodh Gaya to commemorate the [[Buddha]]'s attainment of supreme enlightenment.<ref name='UNESCO WHC'>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1056 |title= Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, Description |website=www.whc.unesco.org |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=27 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe period of Hindu revivalism began with the [[Gupta Empire]] during the 4th and 5th centuries CE. [[Samudragupta]] of Magadha brought Gaya into the limelight, making it the capital of Bihar district during the Gupta empire.\n\nIn 750 CE, Gaya became a part of the [[Pala Empire]], under the rule of its founder, [[Gopala]]. It is believed that the present temple of Bodh Gaya was built during the reign of Gopala's son, Dharmapala.\n\nIn the 12th century CE, Gaya was invaded by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji]] of the [[Ghaznavid Empire]]. By 1557, it had become part of the [[Mughal Empire]], and remained under its power until the [[Battle of Buxar]] and the beginning of [[British Raj|British rule]] in 1764. Gaya, along with other parts of the country, gained its independence in 1947.\n\n===Modern history===\nAs attested by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] in the early nineteenth century, the city was divided into two areas: a sacred area in the southern part of the city, called Gaya; and the larger secular area, which may have been known by the Muslim community as Allahabad. During the [[British Raj|British rule]], the commercial and administrative area of the secular zone was formally named Saheb Ganj by British policy reformer [[Thomas Law (1756\u20131834)|Thomas Law]], who was a district officer in Gaya in the late nineteenth century.<ref name='Vidyarthi'>{{cite book |last=Vidyarthi |first=Lalita Prasad |title=The Sacred Complex in Hindu Gaya |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |edition=2nd |date=1978 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S4FidiusPr0C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=gaya+priests+district&source=bl&ots=C-SjM5JD0j&sig=dQ7Ocyj2wyAm07DU2yG-d02-WEI&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtwvqyrN3dAhXSxIUKHRE9CMgQ6AEwCHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=gaya%20priests%20district&f=false\n|pages=1\u201329 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Sacred Centres of Gaya |isbn=978-1-234-56789-7 |access-date=28 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n[[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]], founder of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] peasant movement in 1936, established an ashram at [[Neyamatpur]], Gaya, which later became the centre of the freedom struggle in [[Bihar]].

But, if \u2018Shraddh rituals\u2019 of that person are performed at \u2018Gaya\u2019 then the soul of such a man will get rid of the tortures of the hell and will go to heaven.

During this period, Gaya witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties in the [[Magadha]] region, where it occupied an important place in cultural history over some 2,400 years between the 6th century BCE and the 18th century CE.\n\nThe city's cultural significance began with the dynasty founded by Sisunaga, who exercised power over Patna and Gaya around 600 BCE. [[Bimbisara]], fifth king of the dynasty, who lived and ruled around 519 BCE, had projected Gaya to the outer world. Having attained an important place in the history of civilization, the area experienced the influence of Gautama Buddha and Bhagwan Mahavir during the reign of Bimbisara. After a brief period under the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda dynasty]] (345\u2013321 BCE), Gaya and the entire Magadha region came under Mauryan rule. Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]] (272\u2013232 BCE) embraced and promoted Buddhism. He visited Gaya, and built the first temple at Bodh Gaya to commemorate the [[Buddha]]'s attainment of supreme enlightenment.<ref name='UNESCO WHC'>{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1056 |title= Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, Description |website=www.whc.unesco.org |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=27 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe period of Hindu revivalism began with the [[Gupta Empire]] during the 4th and 5th centuries CE. [[Samudragupta]] of Magadha brought Gaya into the limelight, making it the capital of Bihar district during the Gupta empire.\n\nIn 750 CE, Gaya became a part of the [[Pala Empire]], under the rule of its founder, [[Gopala]]. It is believed that the present temple of Bodh Gaya was built during the reign of Gopala's son, Dharmapala.\n\nIn the 12th century CE, Gaya was invaded by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji]] of the [[Ghaznavid Empire]]. By 1557, it had become part of the [[Mughal Empire]], and remained under its power until the [[Battle of Buxar]] and the beginning of [[British Raj|British rule]] in 1764. Gaya, along with other parts of the country, gained its independence in 1947.\n\n===Modern history===\nAs attested by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] in the early nineteenth century, the city was divided into two areas: a sacred area in the southern part of the city, called Gaya; and the larger secular area, which may have been known by the Muslim community as Allahabad. During the [[British Raj|British rule]], the commercial and administrative area of the secular zone was formally named Saheb Ganj by British policy reformer [[Thomas Law (1756\u20131834)|Thomas Law]], who was a district officer in Gaya in the late nineteenth century.<ref name='Vidyarthi'>{{cite book |last=Vidyarthi |first=Lalita Prasad |title=The Sacred Complex in Hindu Gaya |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |edition=2nd |date=1978 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S4FidiusPr0C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=gaya+priests+district&source=bl&ots=C-SjM5JD0j&sig=dQ7Ocyj2wyAm07DU2yG-d02-WEI&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtwvqyrN3dAhXSxIUKHRE9CMgQ6AEwCHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=gaya%20priests%20district&f=false\n|pages=1\u201329 |chapter=Chapter 1: The Sacred Centres of Gaya |isbn=978-1-234-56789-7 |access-date=28 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n[[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]], founder of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] peasant movement in 1936, established an ashram at [[Neyamatpur]], Gaya, which later became the centre of the freedom struggle in [[Bihar]].

As per Hindu belief system, it is believed that a person goes to hell if he dies in the following circumstances - if he meets an accidental death, if he dies without his consecrations being performed, or if he is killed by a wild animal. But, if \u2018Shraddh rituals\u2019 of that person are performed at \u2018Gaya\u2019 then the soul of such a man will get rid of the tortures of the hell and will go to heaven.

According to one of the stories, Anarkali had an illicit relationship with the [[Mughal Empire|Crown Prince]] [[Jahangir]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] had her enclosed in a wall where she died. There is no historic proof of Anarakali's existence although her character often appears in movies, books and fictionalized versions of history.\n\nAnarkali was first mentioned in the journal of an English tourist and trader, [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]], after he visited the [[Mughal Empire]] on 24 August, 1608.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/694833/legend-anarkali-myth-mystery-and-history |title=Legend: Anarkali: myth, mystery and history |accessdate=2013-09-05}}</ref> The story was also written by Indian writer [[Abdul Halim Sharar]] and on the first page of his book, he clearly mentions it to be a work of fiction. Nevertheless, Anarkali's story has been adapted into literature, art and cinema.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nShe is depicted in the Bollywood movie, [[Mughal-e-Azam]], which is set during the [[Mughal era|Mughal]] period. According to legend, Anarkali was ordered to be buried alive between two walls by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] for having an illicit relationship with the Crown-Prince Salim, later to become Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]]. \n\nThere is disagreement among scholars concerning the authenticity of Anarkali's story. There are many supporting and opposing views such as the ones mentioned below.\n\nThe earliest Western stories about the love affair between Salim and Anarkali were written by two British travellers, William Finch and Edward Terry. William Finch reached Lahore in February 1611 (only 11 years after the supposed death of Anarkali), to sell [[Indigo dye|indigo]] he had purchased at [[Bayana]] on behalf of the [[East India Company]]. His account, written in early 17th-century English, gives the following information.\n\nAnarkali had an affair with Prince Salim (Jahangir). Upon notice of the affair, King Akbar ordered her to be enclosed within a wall of his palace, where she died. The King Jahangir, as a token of his love, ordered a magnificent tomb of stone to be built in the midst of a walled four-square garden surrounded by a gate. The body of the tomb, the emperor willed to be wrought in gold.\n\nEdward Terry, who visited a few years after William Finch, wrote that Akbar had threatened to disinherit Jahangir for his liaison with Anarkali, the emperor\u2019s most beloved wife. But on his death-bed, Akbar repealed it.\n\nBasing his analysis on the above two accounts, [[Abraham Eraly]], the author of ''The Last Spring: The Lives and Times of the Great Mughals'', suspects that there \"seems to have been an [[Oedipal complex|oedipal]] conflict between Akbar and Salim.\" He also considers it probable that the legendary Anarkali was none other than the mother of Prince Daniyal. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nEraly supports his hypothesis by quoting an incident recorded by Abul Fazl, Akbar's court-historian. According to the historian, Salim was beaten up one evening by guards of Akbar's royal harem. The story goes that a mad man wandered into Akbar\u2019s harem because of the carelessness of the guards. Abul Fazl writes that Salim caught the man but was himself mistaken for the intruder. The emperor arrived upon the scene and was about to strike with his sword when he recognised Salim. It is likely that the intruder was none other than Prince Salim and that the story of the mad man was concocted to put a veil on the prince's indecency.\n\nBut the accounts of the British travellers, and consequently the presumption of Eraly, is unlikely in light of the fact that Prince Daniyal's mother died in 1596, which does not match the dates inscribed on the sarcophagus.\n\nAnother scholar, Muhammed Baqir, the author of ''Lahore Past and Present'' opines that Anarkali was originally the name of the garden in which the tomb was situated. However, with the passage of time, the tomb itself came to be named as that of Anarkali\u2019s. This garden is mentioned by Dara Shikoh, the grandson of Jahangir, in his work, ''Sakinat al-Auliya'', as one of the places where the saint, Mian Mir, used to sit. Dara also mentions the existence of a tomb in the garden but he does not give it any name.\n\nMuhammed Baqir believes that the so-called tomb of Anarkali actually belonged to a lady named or entitled Sahib-i Jamal, another wife of Salim, the mother of the prince\u2019s second son, Sultan Parvez, and a daughter of the noble Zain Khan Koka. This conclusion is also partially faulty. The mother of Sultan Parviz was not a daughter of Zain Khan Koka but the daughter of Khawaja Hasan, the paternal uncle of Zain Khan. Of course, subsequently, the daughter of Zain Khan was also married to Salim on 18 June 1596.\n\nIt is recorded in Akbar Nama that Jahangir \"became violently enamoured of the daughter of Zain Khan Koka. H.M. (Akbar) was displeased at the impropriety, but he saw that his heart was immoderately affected, he, of necessity, gave his consent.\" The translator of Akbar Nama, H. Beveridge, opines that Akbar objected to the marriage, because the Prince was already married \"to Zain Khan\u2019s niece\" (actually the daughter of paternal uncle of Zain Khan, and hence his sister). Akbar objected to marrying near relations. But we do not know the date of death of either of the two wives of Jahangir.\n\nNoted art historian [[Ram Nath|R. Nath]] argues that Jahangir had no wife on record bearing the name or title Anarkali to whom the emperor could have built a tomb and dedicated a couplet with a suffix ''[[Majnun]]''. He writes: \"[it is] absolutely improbable that the grand Mughal emperor would address his married wife as ''yar'', designate himself as ''majnun'' and aspire to see her face once again. Had he not seen her enough? Obviously she was not his married wife but only his beloved, to whom he would take the liberty to be romantic and a little poetic too, and it appears to be a case of an unsuccessful romance of a disappointed lover... The prince could not save her, though it is on record that he was so unhappy with his father in this year 1599 that he defied his orders and revolted. It may be recalled that Mehrunissa (later Nurjahan Begum) was also married to Sher Afgan the same year and the young Prince was so dejected and disturbed on the failure of his two romances and annihilation of his tender feelings of love that he went as far as to defy Akbar.\" {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAlthough there are many views over the death of Anarkali, the most prominent are:\n\n1. Anarkali or \"Sharrafunnisa\", although cemented behind the wall by the order of Akbar, was released by the emperor on the request of Anarkali's mother, \"Jillo Bai\". Emperor Akbar had promised Anarkali's mother one wish in her life. Thereby, Anarkali escaped through a secret route to the outskirts of Delhi and then went to Lahore and lived there until her death.\n\nThere exists a tomb of Anarkali in Lahore. It was in Lahore that Prince Salim set eyes upon Anarkali (\"Pomegranate Blossom\"). She was Emperor Akbar's favorite dancing girl and, legend has it, that he was furious when he learned of her affair with the prince. As punishment, he had Anarkali entombed outside the fort. Whether this story is fact or fiction, a modest tomb does stand in Lahore which is believed to have been built by the lovesick prince in 1615. The gravestone in the tomb for Anarkali bears a tragic inscription:\n<poem>\nCould I behold the face of my beloved once more,\nI would thank God until the day of resurrection.</poem>\n\nThe tomb was converted into a church during British occupation and now serves as an archive (with a collection of old prints) within the compound of the Government Record Office.\nOn the lower Mall Road, inside the grounds of the Punjab Secretariat, lies the tomb of Anarkali. The tomb is accessible to the public. \n\n2. The second view is that Anarkali, after the death of Akbar, was recalled by Salim (Jahangir) after which they married. She was given a new identity, Nur Jahan.\n\nHer father came to the sub-continent during the time of the Mughal emperor, Akbar, and entered into his service. He rose rapidly through the ranks on merit. In 1607, Nur Jahan was brought to the court as a royal ward. She was beautiful and highly intelligent and attracted Jahangir's attention.\n\nA good deal of fiction has gathered around this remarkable woman, obscuring her personality and role in the social and political life of the period. It is wrongly and widely believed that Jahangir murdered Sher Afghan, Nur Jahan's first husband, because he wanted to marry Nur Jahan. In reality, Sher Afghan died in a skirmish with Jahangir's foster brother, Qutbuddin Koka, in 1607. The conqueror of the world, Jahangir, fell in love with Nur Jahan and married her in 1611. He gave her the title of Nur Mehal, \"Light of the Palace\", and later, Nur Jahan, \"Light of the World\".\n\nAfter marriage, Nur Jahan won Jahangir's complete confidence. She carefully attended to the affairs of the state. Her father and brother became ministers and together they dominated the courts. A number of historians believe that Nur Jahan became the real power behind the throne and practically the sovereign of the Mughal Empire. For many years she wielded the imperial powers. She even gave audiences at her palace and her name was placed on the coinage.\n\nThe decision to marry her daughter, Ladli Begum (from her first husband), to Shah Jahan's younger brother, Shahryar, caused Shah Jahan's rebellion. There are rumors that she had previously formed a junta supporting Shah Jahan's right to the throne along with her father Ghias Beg and her brother Abul Hasan (later Asaf Khan), who was also Shah Jahan's father-in-law. However, when Shah Jahan refused to marry Ladli Begum in spite of Nur Jahan's command, she married her daughter off to Shahryar, who was more compliant than his brother. Emperor Jahangir was captured by rebels in 1626 while he was on his way to Kashmir. Nur Jahan intervened to get her husband released. Jahangir was rescued but died on 28 October 1627.\n\nNur Jehan had a magnificent tomb erected over the grave of her husband. She retired from the world and lived a quiet and lonely life for 16 years after the death of Jahangir. She died in 1645 and is buried beside Jahangir at Shahdra, Lahore.\n\n== Film Portrayals ==\n\nAnarkali has been the subject of a number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani books, plays and films.

According to one of the stories, Anarkali had an illicit relationship with the [[Mughal Empire|Crown Prince]] [[Jahangir]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] had her enclosed in a wall where she died. There is no historic proof of Anarakali's existence although her character often appears in movies, books and fictionalized versions of history.\n\nAnarkali was first mentioned in the journal of an English tourist and trader, [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]], after he visited the [[Mughal Empire]] on 24 August, 1608.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://beta.dawn.com/news/694833/legend-anarkali-myth-mystery-and-history |title=Legend: Anarkali: myth, mystery and history |accessdate=2013-09-05}}</ref> The story was also written by Indian writer [[Abdul Halim Sharar]] and on the first page of his book, he clearly mentions it to be a work of fiction. Nevertheless, Anarkali's story has been adapted into literature, art and cinema.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nShe is depicted in the Bollywood movie, [[Mughal-e-Azam]], which is set during the [[Mughal era|Mughal]] period. According to legend, Anarkali was ordered to be buried alive between two walls by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] for having an illicit relationship with the Crown-Prince Salim, later to become Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]]. \n\nThere is disagreement among scholars concerning the authenticity of Anarkali's story. There are many supporting and opposing views such as the ones mentioned below.\n\nThe earliest Western stories about the love affair between Salim and Anarkali were written by two British travellers, William Finch and Edward Terry. William Finch reached Lahore in February 1611 (only 11 years after the supposed death of Anarkali), to sell [[Indigo dye|indigo]] he had purchased at [[Bayana]] on behalf of the [[East India Company]]. His account, written in early 17th-century English, gives the following information.\n\nAnarkali had an affair with Prince Salim (Jahangir). Upon notice of the affair, King Akbar ordered her to be enclosed within a wall of his palace, where she died. The King Jahangir, as a token of his love, ordered a magnificent tomb of stone to be built in the midst of a walled four-square garden surrounded by a gate. The body of the tomb, the emperor willed to be wrought in gold.\n\nEdward Terry, who visited a few years after William Finch, wrote that Akbar had threatened to disinherit Jahangir for his liaison with Anarkali, the emperor\u2019s most beloved wife. But on his death-bed, Akbar repealed it.\n\nBasing his analysis on the above two accounts, [[Abraham Eraly]], the author of ''The Last Spring: The Lives and Times of the Great Mughals'', suspects that there \"seems to have been an [[Oedipal complex|oedipal]] conflict between Akbar and Salim.\" He also considers it probable that the legendary Anarkali was none other than the mother of Prince Daniyal. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nEraly supports his hypothesis by quoting an incident recorded by Abul Fazl, Akbar's court-historian.

In 1951 he died in Prague of a heart attack, said to be a result of a ferocious Soviet press campaign against him as a '[[Trotskyite|Trotskyism]] degenerate,' his papers were destroyed by the secret police, and his published work was suppressed for decades.\n\n== Writings ==\n\n===Original versions===\n\n==== Studies ====\n* ''Stavba a b\u00e1se\u0148'' (1927)\n* ''Sv\u011bt, kter\u00fd se sm\u011bje'' (1928)\n* ''Sv\u011bt, kter\u00fd von\u00ed'' (1930)\n* ''Surrealismus proti proudu'' (1938)\n* ''Jarmark um\u011bn\u00ed'' (1964)\n\n====Scientific writings====\n* ''Archipenko'' (1923)\n* ''Jan Zrzav\u00fd'' (1923)\n* ''Soudob\u00e1 mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed architektura'' (1928)\n* ''Sov\u011btsk\u00e1 kultura'' (1928)\n* ''Modern\u00ed architektura v \u010ceskoslovensku'' (1930.

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lpc95\" /> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The foundation columns were placed as close to the subway tunnel as possible, in order to reduce the length of the trusses, which would have had to carry heavy loads. All of the foundation columns were sunk to the depth of the rock underneath.<ref name=\"AR pp. 21\" />\n\nA [[cofferdam]] was then built on the eastern border of the site, and on part of the northern border. The rock surface underneath the building site was closer to the ground on the western side of the lot, requiring extensive excavation. On the eastern side of the lot, the rock surface sloped below the elevation of the subway tunnel. A {{Convert|6|ft|m|-thick|abbr=|adj=mid}} wall was built on the southern boundary of the Cunard lot, of which a {{Convert|2|ft||adj=on}} width was located under the Bowling Green Offices Building.

The outer pavilions are set back beyond the 18th story to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The central pavilion contains a loggia between the 19th and 21st stories, also supported by Tuscan-style column pairs, and includes a [[mansard roof]] above the 22nd story.

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s.
