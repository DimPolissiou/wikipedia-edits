There were 36,563 housing units at an average density of 26 per square&nbsp;mile (10/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the county was 53.7% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 8.3% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 1.7% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 3.1% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.2% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 28.3% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.8% from two or more races.  43.6% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race. 7.1% were of [[Portuguese Americans|Portuguese]], 6.2% [[German Americans|German]], 5.3% [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and 5.1% [[American ancestry|American]] ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 63.6% spoke [[English language|English]], 30.9% [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 1.4% [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], 1.4% [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and 1.3% [[Samoan language|Samoan]] as their first language.\n\nThere were 34,418 households out of which 46.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.0% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 14.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.6% were non-families. 17.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

There were 36,563 housing units at an average density of 26 per square&nbsp;mile (10/km\u00b2).

It was released through [[Interscope Records]] on September 27, 2018 as the lead single from the [[A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the 2018 musical romantic drama film, ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. \"Shallow\" was written by Gaga with [[Andrew Wyatt]], [[Anthony Rossomando]] and [[Mark Ronson]], and produced by Gaga with Benjamin Rice. The song is heard three times throughout the film, most prominently during a sequence when Cooper's character Jackson Maine invites Gaga's character Ally to perform it onstage with him. The scene was filmed in front of a live audience at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]], California.\n\n\"Shallow\" is a pivotal moment in ''A Star Is Born'', since it speaks about Ally and Jackson's conversations. Gaga wrote it from Ally's point of view with the self-aware lyrics asking each other if they are content being who they are. A [[rock music|rock]] [[sentimental ballad|power ballad]],<ref name=\"rock\"/> the song finds Gaga and Cooper trading verses and gradually moves toward the climactic final chorus with a vocal run by Gaga. The recording is interspersed with the sound of audience noise and applause. Gaga premiered it on DJ [[Zane Lowe]]'s [[Beats 1]] radio show while giving an interview about the film. An accompanying [[music video]] was also released, showing both Gaga and Cooper's characters singing \"Shallow\" together onstage, interspersed with scenes from ''A Star Is Born''.\n\nThe track received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who commended Gaga's vocals, the dramatic nature of the composition and the songwriting.

Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].\n\nAs computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing video games<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools & Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}</ref> which can often take between one and three years to develop.

Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: trade-in myths\">{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Practices ==\nVideo game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.\n\nHowever, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.\n\n=== Breakaways ===\nIn the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the \"original\" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the meantime, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] n\u00e9e [[Infogrames]]).\n\nActivision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.\n\n=== Piracy ===\nThe industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |work=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}</ref>\nThe most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] transactions.\n\n=== Creative control ===\nOn various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}</ref> the video game industry continues to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:\n# A license to develop games for the console\n# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console\n# A separate license for each game\n\nIn addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nAn alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].\n\n=== Gaming conventions ===\n[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual video game conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite magazine|title=E3

Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAlso, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a \"director\") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\nSecondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} -->\n\n====South Korea====\n{{main|Video gaming in South Korea}}\nThe video game industry in South Korea generally followed the same early trends as the Japanese market, but players started focusing on massively-multiplayer online games (MMO) and other games that could be played at [[PC bang]]s (Internet cafes). South Korea was one of the first major regions involved in [[esport]]s in the 1990s and 2000s, and today a large number of professional esports players originate from South Korea.\n\n===Others===\n==== Africa ====\nThe video game industry is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,<ref name=\"Africa top 10\">{{cite news|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|work=[[IT News Africa]]|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}</ref> but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.<ref name=\"Mail & Guardian\">{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=[[Mail & Guardian]] Africa|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Australia and New Zealand====\n{{main|Video gaming in Australia}}\nAustralia and New Zealand have an active video game industry, with several standalone developers as well as additional studios from other major developers across the globe.\n\n== Conventions, trade shows, and conferences ==\n{{See also|:Category:Video game conventions|:Category:Video game trade shows|:Category:Video game conferences|}}\n[[Image:Gamescom 2009 - Koelnmesse S\u00fcdeingang (5473).jpg|thumb|The [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], the major video game fair by attendance.]]\n[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. These typically provide the means for developers and publishers to demonstrate their games directly to video game players and consumers and obtain feedback. New games are frequently introduced during these events. Some examples of each conventions include the annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], and numerous [[PAX (event)|PAX]] events. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.\n\nNational trade groups that support their local video game industry often will hold [[trade show]]s aimed for developers and publishers to interact more directly with the video game media, and with retailers and distributors for planning future sales of products. The largest such trade show is the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in Los Angeles, California is held by the [[Entertainment Software Association]]. Other similar trade shows include  [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. \n\nThe development of video games is also a topic of academic and professional interest, leading to a number of [[Academic conference|conferences]] for developers to share their knowledge with others. Two of the major professional conferences include the [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC), which holds multiple events through the year but with its main annual conference held in March in San Francisco, and the [[D.I.C.E. Summit]] run by the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] in February of each year at Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n==Media coverage and archiving==\n{{See also|Video game journalism|Video game preservation}}\nThe coverage of the video game industry started off with several magazines covering the topic, but as the Internet became widely available to support [[new media]], much of the dedicated coverage of the video game industry has transitioned to detected websites, including ''[[Gamasutra]]'', ''[[IGN]]'', ''[[Eurogamer]]'', ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' and ''[[GameSpot]]''. More recently, the effect of [[Internet celebrity|social media influencers]], video game players that create online videos or stream themselves playing games through services like [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], have also become a significant source for coverage of video game news from the consumer point of view.\n\nAnother facet of tracking the history of the video game industry is [[video game preservation]], a process that is complicated due to game hardware technology that can become obsolete, dependencies on decommissioned online servers, and issues over [[intellectual property]] that legally restricts preservation efforts. Much of the industry's history prior to the 1983 crash has been lost, as companies affected by the crash simply threw material away, leaving little to recover today. There is better awareness of video game preservation into the 21st century, and several groups and museums have been established to collect and preserve hardware and software for the industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://globalnews.ca/news/4383441/retro-game-preservation-in-limbo-after-nintendo-files-lawsuit/ | title = Retro game preservation in limbo after Nintendo files lawsuit | first=  Christopher | last = Whan | date = August 12, 2018 | accessdate = August 14, 2018 | work = [[Global News]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recognition within the industry==\n{{See also|List of video game awards}}\nThe video game industry has a number of annual award ceremonies, commonly associated with the above conventions, trade shows, and conferences, as well as standalone award shows. Many of the dedicated video game journalism websites also have their own set of awards. Most commonly, these ceremonies are capped by the top prize, the \"[[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]]\".\n\n== Trends ==\nPlayers become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.\n\nWhile this \"community of modifiers\" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[Video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.<ref name=\"newmedia\" />\n\nThe industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.\n\nIn addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.<ref>{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220\u2013221|edition=Eighth}}</ref>\n\nAs this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, \"Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014.

Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].\n\nAs computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing video games<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools & Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}</ref> which can often take between one and three years to develop.

Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: trade-in myths\">{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Practices ==\nVideo game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.\n\nHowever, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.\n\n=== Breakaways ===\nIn the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the \"original\" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the meantime, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] n\u00e9e [[Infogrames]]).\n\nActivision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.\n\n=== Piracy ===\nThe industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |work=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}</ref>\nThe most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] transactions.\n\n=== Creative control ===\nOn various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}</ref> the video game industry continues to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:\n# A license to develop games for the console\n# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console\n# A separate license for each game\n\nIn addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nAn alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].\n\n=== Gaming conventions ===\n[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual video game conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite magazine|title=E3

Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAlso, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a \"director\") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\nSecondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} -->\n\n====South Korea====\n{{main|Video gaming in South Korea}}\nThe video game industry in South Korea generally followed the same early trends as the Japanese market, but players started focusing on massively-multiplayer online games (MMO) and other games that could be played at [[PC bang]]s (Internet cafes). South Korea was one of the first major regions involved in [[esport]]s in the 1990s and 2000s, and today a large number of professional esports players originate from South Korea.\n\n===Others===\n==== Africa ====\nThe video game industry is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,<ref name=\"Africa top 10\">{{cite news|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|work=[[IT News Africa]]|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}</ref> but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.<ref name=\"Mail & Guardian\">{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=[[Mail & Guardian]] Africa|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Australia and New Zealand====\n{{main|Video gaming in Australia}}\nAustralia and New Zealand have an active video game industry, with several standalone developers as well as additional studios from other major developers across the globe.\n\n== Conventions, trade shows, and conferences ==\n{{See also|:Category:Video game conventions|:Category:Video game trade shows|:Category:Video game conferences|}}\n[[Image:Gamescom 2009 - Koelnmesse S\u00fcdeingang (5473).jpg|thumb|The [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], the major video game fair by attendance.]]\n[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. These typically provide the means for developers and publishers to demonstrate their games directly to video game players and consumers and obtain feedback. New games are frequently introduced during these events. Some examples of each conventions include the annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], and numerous [[PAX (event)|PAX]] events. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.\n\nNational trade groups that support their local video game industry often will hold [[trade show]]s aimed for developers and publishers to interact more directly with the video game media, and with retailers and distributors for planning future sales of products. The largest such trade show is the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in Los Angeles, California is held by the [[Entertainment Software Association]]. Other similar trade shows include  [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. \n\nThe development of video games is also a topic of academic and professional interest, leading to a number of [[Academic conference|conferences]] for developers to share their knowledge with others. Two of the major professional conferences include the [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC), which holds multiple events through the year but with its main annual conference held in March in San Francisco, and the [[D.I.C.E. Summit]] run by the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] in February of each year at Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n==Media coverage and archiving==\n{{See also|Video game journalism|Video game preservation}}\nThe coverage of the video game industry started off with several magazines covering the topic, but as the Internet became widely available to support [[new media]], much of the dedicated coverage of the video game industry has transitioned to detected websites, including ''[[Gamasutra]]'', ''[[IGN]]'', ''[[Eurogamer]]'', ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' and ''[[GameSpot]]''. More recently, the effect of [[Internet celebrity|social media influencers]], video game players that create online videos or stream themselves playing games through services like [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], have also become a significant source for coverage of video game news from the consumer point of view.\n\nAnother facet of tracking the history of the video game industry is [[video game preservation]], a process that is complicated due to game hardware technology that can become obsolete, dependencies on decommissioned online servers, and issues over [[intellectual property]] that legally restricts preservation efforts. Much of the industry's history prior to the 1983 crash has been lost, as companies affected by the crash simply threw material away, leaving little to recover today. There is better awareness of video game preservation into the 21st century, and several groups and museums have been established to collect and preserve hardware and software for the industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://globalnews.ca/news/4383441/retro-game-preservation-in-limbo-after-nintendo-files-lawsuit/ | title = Retro game preservation in limbo after Nintendo files lawsuit | first=  Christopher | last = Whan | date = August 12, 2018 | accessdate = August 14, 2018 | work = [[Global News]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recognition within the industry==\n{{See also|List of video game awards}}\nThe video game industry has a number of annual award ceremonies, commonly associated with the above conventions, trade shows, and conferences, as well as standalone award shows. Many of the dedicated video game journalism websites also have their own set of awards. Most commonly, these ceremonies are capped by the top prize, the \"[[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]]\".\n\n== Trends ==\nPlayers become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.\n\nWhile this \"community of modifiers\" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[Video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.<ref name=\"newmedia\" />\n\nThe industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.\n\nIn addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.<ref>{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J.

The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, \"Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J.

Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld video game systems combined.<ref>{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J.

The producers then decided to abandon the live-action sequel ideas and instead developed this cartoon series to continue the story.\n\nThe show aired on [[Fox Kids]] television from 1996\u20131998 for 3 seasons. 52 episodes were produced, but only the first 46 appeared on FOX, with the remaining debuting on [[Freeform (TV channel)|FOX Family Channel]]. Many of the same people who worked on this show also worked on ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' (the latter of which was a spin-off from the former; coincidentally, the former had also debuted on FOX).\n\nThe new ''Casper'' broke from earlier versions, following a sitcom-style pattern of one-liners and pop culture gags in a manner similar to the ''Casper'' feature. The show would also frequently break the fourth wall. The show used old ''Casper'' supporting characters such as Casper's cousin [[Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost|Spooky]], Spooky's \"ghoulfriend\" [[Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost|Pearl]] (or \"Poil\" as rendered by Spooky's [[Brooklyn]] accent), and [[Harvey Comics|Nightmare the Ghost Horse]] who, unlike in the original cartoons and comics, does not actually talk (though voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). The show also introduced new characters, including Casper's super-loud teacher Ms. Banshee.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Casper ===\n{{main|Casper the Friendly Ghost}}\n\n'''Casper McFadden''' has been haunting his family home of Whipstaff Manor for some time, having died from [[pneumonia]] (according to a newspaper seen during the scene in the attic from the feature film) after he played out in the cold for too long when he was twelve years old. Now in the care of his three troublemaking uncles, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, Casper's afterlife is not exactly pleasant. He has to put up with his uncles' outrageous antics, and his wish to gain a friend in a human is usually ruined. The only exception to this was when Kat and Dr. Harvey moved into Whipstaff. Kat became a close friend to him. Casper has been a ghost for just over a hundred years, as Stinkie and Fatso once stated that Casper's age is a 115 and a half years old. Casper himself is very friendly and outgoing, but he sometimes appears rather shy. Most ghosts view his behaviour as unusual, as they believe ghosts should not be friendly or polite in any way. Other ghosts are sometimes even afraid of his good manners, to which Casper sometimes uses to his advantage. One example was when the Ghostly Trio appealed to Casper for help after being convicted in a supernatural court, which denied them to be ghosts any longer as they had no unfinished business on Earth, therefore they would have to crossover. Casper intervened, and revealed quite honestly that his uncles had not taught him how to be scary yet, enabling them to remain as ghosts on Earth. As in the film, Casper is [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Malachi Pearson]].\n\n=== The Ghostly Trio ===\n{{main|Ghostly Trio}}\n'''The Ghostly Trio''' are Casper's uncles, who love scaring humans, or as they call them, \"fleshies\", \"skinbags\", \"bone-bags\" and \"skinsacks\". They include '''Stretch''', the tallest, and hot-headed leader, '''Stinkie''', who almost always smells, and in turn loves anything smelly. He uses his bad smell as a weapon or annoyance on others, and '''Fatso''', who is seen as the least intelligent of the brothers, and loves to eat almost anything. The three are chaotic in every sense, and can't resist scaring or causing trouble no matter what the cost. They order Casper around constantly, who they refer to as \"Bulbhead\" or \"Short-sheet\". However, despite being considered mean spirits, they do on a number of occasions display compassionate sides. One example was when Casper was accidently turned into a baby. The Ghostly Trio at first reluctantly, took care of him, but soon bonded with him, particularly Stretch. They also appeared to be worried about Casper when they thought he was going to face \"the most evil spirit to haunt the Earth\", Whitebeard, on his own. There was a rare occasion when Casper became furious and shouted at the Trio for not restraining their own anger during a \"frightening storm\", which fed off the fury of others. Casper even planned on leaving his uncles, which surprised them further. However, using the best thing to compliments only the Trio could give, such as \"fun to knock around\", \"easily insultable\", and even admitting that they liked him, they persuaded him to stay. In the film, the primary turning point for the Ghostly Trio was when they kept their promise to Dr. Harvey, and brought his wife Amelia, to speak to him one last time. As in the feature film, they are voiced by Joe Nipote, [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Brad Garrett]], although in the third and fourth seasons Fatso would be voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], who also voiced Fatso in the unrelated direct-to-video films: ''[[Casper: A Spirited Beginning]]'' and ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]''. (Notably, Harnell also voiced [[Wakko Warner]], who like Fatso also has a voracious appetite, and was one of three manic siblings who perpetually annoyed a [[Dr. Otto Scratchansniff|psychiatrist]].)\n\n=== Dr. Harvey ===\n'''Dr. James Harvey''' (or '''\"Doc\"''' as he is called by the Ghostly Trio) is a [[psychiatrist]] and is shown to be an alumnus of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In the film, after his wife Amelia's death, he has gone on to become a \"ghost therapist\u201d to find and make contact with his wife, because he believes she is a ghost. However, after learning that she instead became an angel, he and his teenage daughter Kat stay at their new home of Whipstaff, where he continues to work as a ghost therapist, trying (unsuccessfully) to rehabilitate the mischief-making Ghostly Trio. Dr. Harvey is an easy-going guy with a big heart. He obviously loves Kat, although he sometimes appears rather neglectful of his motherless daughter's emotional needs. This was demonstrated in the scene from the film where he speaks with his departed wife when he says he is worried that he's not taking good care of her, but Amelia assured him that he was doing a good job, although she gave him some \"motherly\" advice (\"Don't pick up the extension every time she gets a phone call, french fries are not a breakfast food...\" etc.) Dr. Harvey tolerates the Ghostly Trio antics, and it is because of this that they grow to like him, and kept their promise to him so he could speak to Amelia. The animated version of Dr. Harvey deviates slightly from the film version, in that the animated Dr. Harvey was totally focused on being a therapist and used psychological epithets when talking to everyone, including his own daughter. Kat, Casper and the Ghostly trio simply regarded this as an eccentricity. The role was originated by [[Bill Pullman]] in the ''Casper'' film, but he is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] on the show.\n\n=== Kat Harvey ===\n'''Kathleen \"Kat\" Harvey''' is the daughter of Dr. Harvey and is portrayed as the [[stereotypical]] [[teenager]] who has a sense of [[humour]].\n\nShe is about thirteen years old (about the age [[Christina Ricci]], who originated the role in the ''Casper'' film, was when the film was filmed) and is a good companion to Casper. Kat hates having to put up with the Ghostly Trio because none of them get along with her. Any time they spend together usually involves insulting each other. On one occasion, after the Trio made fun of her for not being able to get a job, Kat made a bet with them saying she could get a job, and bring home a paycheque before they could. The end result was all of them getting a job in the same theatre, which became partly destroyed, after which they declared a draw. But there are rare occasions when Kat and the Ghostly Trio would work together. One example was when to Kat and Casper's surprise, the Trio were trying to return the goldfish Kat won at a fair back to its mother. At first she thought they were going to turn it into a \"ghost fish\", but when they told her what they were planning, she became slightly emotional and decided to help. Another example was when Dr. Harvey was given his own television show in order to help all ghosts. Both he and Casper became famous and power hungry, resulting in Kat and the Ghostly Trio being neglected, and treated badly. This resulted in them working together to remind Dr. Harvey what was more important. Kat is voiced by [[Kath Soucie]] on the show.\n\n===Spooky===\n{{main|Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost}}\n\n'''Spooky''' is Casper's mischief-minded cousin. He looks up to the Ghostly Trio as his heroes and, while having no true dislike for Casper, despises his cousin's lack of interest in scaring humans. As such, Spooky is always trying to out-scare Casper and become the best in class, but usually fails. However, underneath the gruff, ghostly exterior, Spooky may also have a slight soft spot for his cousin. Spooky is visually very similar to Casper, but he has a black nose and freckles, wears a brown \"doiby\" hat, and speaks in a [[Brooklyn accent]]. He is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n\n===Poil===\n'''Poil''' is Spooky's [[Girlfriend|\"ghoulfriend\"]]. Often absent-minded, Poil is almost always oblivious to current situations and takes things way too literally. She adores Spooky and everything about him, right down to the [[freckles]] on his face and his black nose, is good friends with Casper and doesn't care as much for the Ghostly Trio as Spooky does. She is voiced by [[Miriam Flynn]].\n\n===Ms. Banshee===\n'''Ms. Maddie Banshee''' is the teacher at Casper, Spooky and Poil's ghost school. [[Banshee|Befitting her name]], Ms. Banshee can yell loud enough to be heard several towns away, even to wake the dead. Ms. Banshee enjoys being a teacher, but dreams of being a professional opera singer. All three of the Ghostly Trio have a crush on Ms. Banshee, and constantly compete for her affections. Ms. Banshee is ok with the Trio, but remains unimpressed with their efforts. She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n===Amber Whitmire and the Jennifers===\n'''Amber Whitmire''' and the '''Jennifers''' are classmates and rivals of Kat's at Friendship Junior High School. Amber and the Jennifers are portrayed as rich, mean, spoiled [[queen bees]]. Jennifer #1 has brown hair and wears glasses and is the closest to Amber, Jennifer #2 has red hair, and Jennifer #3 has blonde hair and a snorting laugh and is the least intelligent of the three. Amber is voiced by [[Sherry Lynn]] and the Jennifers are voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired \n|-\n!

The producers then decided to abandon the live-action sequel ideas and instead developed this cartoon series to continue the story.\n\nThe show aired on [[Fox Kids]] television from 1996\u20131998 for 3 seasons. 52 episodes were produced, but only the first 46 appeared on FOX, with the remaining debuting on [[Freeform (TV channel)|FOX Family Channel]]. Many of the same people who worked on this show also worked on ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' (the latter of which was a spin-off from the former; coincidentally, the former had also debuted on FOX).\n\nThe new ''Casper'' broke from earlier versions, following a sitcom-style pattern of one-liners and pop culture gags in a manner similar to the ''Casper'' feature. The show would also frequently break the fourth wall. The show used old ''Casper'' supporting characters such as Casper's cousin [[Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost|Spooky]], Spooky's \"ghoulfriend\" [[Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost|Pearl]] (or \"Poil\" as rendered by Spooky's [[Brooklyn]] accent), and [[Harvey Comics|Nightmare the Ghost Horse]] who, unlike in the original cartoons and comics, does not actually talk (though voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). The show also introduced new characters, including Casper's super-loud teacher Ms. Banshee.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Casper ===\n{{main|Casper the Friendly Ghost}}\n\n'''Casper McFadden''' has been haunting his family home of Whipstaff Manor for some time, having died from [[pneumonia]] (according to a newspaper seen during the scene in the attic from the feature film) after he played out in the cold for too long when he was twelve years old. Now in the care of his three troublemaking uncles, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, Casper's afterlife is not exactly pleasant. He has to put up with his uncles' outrageous antics, and his wish to gain a friend in a human is usually ruined. The only exception to this was when Kat and Dr. Harvey moved into Whipstaff. Kat became a close friend to him. Casper has been a ghost for just over a hundred years, as Stinkie and Fatso once stated that Casper's age is a 115 and a half years old. Casper himself is very friendly and outgoing, but he sometimes appears rather shy. Most ghosts view his behaviour as unusual, as they believe ghosts should not be friendly or polite in any way. Other ghosts are sometimes even afraid of his good manners, to which Casper sometimes uses to his advantage. One example was when the Ghostly Trio appealed to Casper for help after being convicted in a supernatural court, which denied them to be ghosts any longer as they had no unfinished business on Earth, therefore they would have to crossover. Casper intervened, and revealed quite honestly that his uncles had not taught him how to be scary yet, enabling them to remain as ghosts on Earth. As in the film, Casper is [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Malachi Pearson]].\n\n=== The Ghostly Trio ===\n{{main|Ghostly Trio}}\n'''The Ghostly Trio''' are Casper's uncles, who love scaring humans, or as they call them, \"fleshies\", \"skinbags\", \"bone-bags\" and \"skinsacks\". They include '''Stretch''', the tallest, and hot-headed leader, '''Stinkie''', who almost always smells, and in turn loves anything smelly. He uses his bad smell as a weapon or annoyance on others, and '''Fatso''', who is seen as the least intelligent of the brothers, and loves to eat almost anything. The three are chaotic in every sense, and can't resist scaring or causing trouble no matter what the cost. They order Casper around constantly, who they refer to as \"Bulbhead\" or \"Short-sheet\". However, despite being considered mean spirits, they do on a number of occasions display compassionate sides. One example was when Casper was accidently turned into a baby. The Ghostly Trio at first reluctantly, took care of him, but soon bonded with him, particularly Stretch. They also appeared to be worried about Casper when they thought he was going to face \"the most evil spirit to haunt the Earth\", Whitebeard, on his own. There was a rare occasion when Casper became furious and shouted at the Trio for not restraining their own anger during a \"frightening storm\", which fed off the fury of others. Casper even planned on leaving his uncles, which surprised them further. However, using the best thing to compliments only the Trio could give, such as \"fun to knock around\", \"easily insultable\", and even admitting that they liked him, they persuaded him to stay. In the film, the primary turning point for the Ghostly Trio was when they kept their promise to Dr. Harvey, and brought his wife Amelia, to speak to him one last time. As in the feature film, they are voiced by Joe Nipote, [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Brad Garrett]], although in the third and fourth seasons Fatso would be voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], who also voiced Fatso in the unrelated direct-to-video films: ''[[Casper: A Spirited Beginning]]'' and ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]''. (Notably, Harnell also voiced [[Wakko Warner]], who like Fatso also has a voracious appetite, and was one of three manic siblings who perpetually annoyed a [[Dr. Otto Scratchansniff|psychiatrist]].)\n\n=== Dr. Harvey ===\n'''Dr. James Harvey''' (or '''\"Doc\"''' as he is called by the Ghostly Trio) is a [[psychiatrist]] and is shown to be an alumnus of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In the film, after his wife Amelia's death, he has gone on to become a \"ghost therapist\u201d to find and make contact with his wife, because he believes she is a ghost. However, after learning that she instead became an angel, he and his teenage daughter Kat stay at their new home of Whipstaff, where he continues to work as a ghost therapist, trying (unsuccessfully) to rehabilitate the mischief-making Ghostly Trio. Dr. Harvey is an easy-going guy with a big heart. He obviously loves Kat, although he sometimes appears rather neglectful of his motherless daughter's emotional needs. This was demonstrated in the scene from the film where he speaks with his departed wife when he says he is worried that he's not taking good care of her, but Amelia assured him that he was doing a good job, although she gave him some \"motherly\" advice (\"Don't pick up the extension every time she gets a phone call, french fries are not a breakfast food...\" etc.) Dr. Harvey tolerates the Ghostly Trio antics, and it is because of this that they grow to like him, and kept their promise to him so he could speak to Amelia. The animated version of Dr. Harvey deviates slightly from the film version, in that the animated Dr. Harvey was totally focused on being a therapist and used psychological epithets when talking to everyone, including his own daughter. Kat, Casper and the Ghostly trio simply regarded this as an eccentricity. The role was originated by [[Bill Pullman]] in the ''Casper'' film, but he is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] on the show.\n\n=== Kat Harvey ===\n'''Kathleen \"Kat\" Harvey''' is the daughter of Dr. Harvey and is portrayed as the [[stereotypical]] [[teenager]] who has a sense of [[humour]].\n\nShe is about thirteen years old (about the age [[Christina Ricci]], who originated the role in the ''Casper'' film, was when the film was filmed) and is a good companion to Casper. Kat hates having to put up with the Ghostly Trio because none of them get along with her. Any time they spend together usually involves insulting each other. On one occasion, after the Trio made fun of her for not being able to get a job, Kat made a bet with them saying she could get a job, and bring home a paycheque before they could. The end result was all of them getting a job in the same theatre, which became partly destroyed, after which they declared a draw. But there are rare occasions when Kat and the Ghostly Trio would work together. One example was when to Kat and Casper's surprise, the Trio were trying to return the goldfish Kat won at a fair back to its mother. At first she thought they were going to turn it into a \"ghost fish\", but when they told her what they were planning, she became slightly emotional and decided to help. Another example was when Dr. Harvey was given his own television show in order to help all ghosts. Both he and Casper became famous and power hungry, resulting in Kat and the Ghostly Trio being neglected, and treated badly. This resulted in them working together to remind Dr. Harvey what was more important. Kat is voiced by [[Kath Soucie]] on the show.\n\n===Spooky===\n{{main|Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost}}\n\n'''Spooky''' is Casper's mischief-minded cousin. He looks up to the Ghostly Trio as his heroes and, while having no true dislike for Casper, despises his cousin's lack of interest in scaring humans. As such, Spooky is always trying to out-scare Casper and become the best in class, but usually fails. However, underneath the gruff, ghostly exterior, Spooky may also have a slight soft spot for his cousin. Spooky is visually very similar to Casper, but he has a black nose and freckles, wears a brown \"doiby\" hat, and speaks in a [[Brooklyn accent]]. He is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].\n\n===Poil===\n'''Poil''' is Spooky's [[Girlfriend|\"ghoulfriend\"]]. Often absent-minded, Poil is almost always oblivious to current situations and takes things way too literally. She adores Spooky and everything about him, right down to the [[freckles]] on his face and his black nose, is good friends with Casper and doesn't care as much for the Ghostly Trio as Spooky does. She is voiced by [[Miriam Flynn]].\n\n===Ms. Banshee===\n'''Ms. Maddie Banshee''' is the teacher at Casper, Spooky and Poil's ghost school. [[Banshee|Befitting her name]], Ms. Banshee can yell loud enough to be heard several towns away, even to wake the dead. Ms. Banshee enjoys being a teacher, but dreams of being a professional opera singer. All three of the Ghostly Trio have a crush on Ms. Banshee, and constantly compete for her affections. Ms. Banshee is ok with the Trio, but remains unimpressed with their efforts. She is voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]].\n\n===Amber Whitmire and the Jennifers===\n'''Amber Whitmire''' and the '''Jennifers''' are classmates and rivals of Kat's at Friendship Junior High School. Amber and the Jennifers are portrayed as rich, mean, spoiled [[queen bees]]. Jennifer #1 has brown hair and wears glasses and is the closest to Amber, Jennifer #2 has red hair, and Jennifer #3 has blonde hair and a snorting laugh and is the least intelligent of the three.

The studio was founded by [[Markus Persson]] in 2009 as '''Mojang Specifications''', inheriting the name from a [[Code Club AB|venture of the same name]] he left two years prior. Mojang began development on the [[sandbox video game]] ''[[Minecraft]]'' in 2009, which would become the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video game of all time]] and establish a successful multimedia franchise. Mojang Specifications became Mojang in 2010. With a desire to move on from ''Minecraft'', Persson sold Mojang to Xbox Game Studios (then called Microsoft Studios) in 2014, after which the studio developed the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'' and ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]''. In addition to the ''Minecraft'' franchise, Mojang developed the 2014 [[Digital collectible card game|digital card game]] ''[[Caller's Bane]]'' and the 2016 [[turn-based strategy|turn-based strategy

of Jonas M\u00e5rtensson ([[chief executive officer]]), Vu Bui ([[chief operating officer]]), Karin Severinson ([[chief financial officer]]), and Rikard Herlitz ([[chief technology

She found that graduates from [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] were two to three times more likely to be included for their professional accomplishments than women from [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational college's]]. Criticisms of the study included the lack of controls for [[socioeconomic status]] and [[self-selection bias]] of student populations. The report was publicized in 1973 and continued to be referenced in discussions about [[women's education]] and [[women in the workforce]]. It followed the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] which increased the public debate about the role of women's colleges in [[Society of the United States|American society]]. In the 1970s and 80s, Tidball researched variations of her first study, such as surveys of women in doctoral or medical programs. She coauthored the volume, ''Taking Women Seriously: Lessons and Legacies for Educating the Majority'' with [[Lisa Wolf-Wendel]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nTidball received the president's medal from GW in 1999 and the order of merit from the [[Cathedral Choral Society]].

In 1976, she assisted the chorus as it reestablished itself as a legal entity that was financially separate from the [[Washington National Cathedral]]. She helped manage the transition from the founder, [[Paul Callaway]] to the new director, [[J. Reilly Lewis]].

She was an advocate for women in academia and [[Women in STEM fields|STEM]] and a supporter of [[Women's college|women's colleges]]. Tidball was a longtime faculty member at [[George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences]] (GW) where she became the institution's first woman appointed professor of physiology. Her research in the 1960s on the career outcomes of graduates from women's colleges versus those from coeducational schools sparked discussions that continued for decades. Tidball was the first female president of the [[Cathedral Choral Society]] where she sang for almost fifty years. \n\n== Early life and education ==\nMary Elizabeth Peters was born on October 15, 1929 in [[Anderson, Indiana]]. She completed a bachelor's degree in physiology and chemistry at [[Mount Holyoke College]] in 1951. Peters married physician and researcher Charles S. Tidball  {{Circa|1953}}. In 1955, she earned a master's degree in physiology from [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. Her master's thesis was titled ''Changes in rate of intestinal absorption of sodium chloride solutions''.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Changes in rate of intestinal absorption of sodium chloride solutions|date=1955|language=English|first=Mary Elizabeth|last=Tidball|oclc=58472340}}</ref> Tidball earned a PhD in physiology and pharmacology from the same institution in 1959.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her dissertation was titled ''The relation of acetylcholine and epinephrine to tonus of intestinal smooth muscle''.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The relation of acetylcholine and epinephrine to tonus of intestinal smooth muscle.|date=1959|language=English|first=Mary Elizabeth|last=Tidball|oclc=51305616}}</ref> In 1990, received a master's in theological studies from [[Wesley Theological Seminary]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Langer|first=Emily|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/m-elizabeth-tidball-gwu-professor-and-cathedral-choral-society-president-dies/2014/02/15/6eedf8d6-94eb-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html|title=M.

She was a champion for [[Women's college|women's colleges]] which, she believed offered advantages such as a larger proportion of female faculty members and administrators. Tidball argued that women need [[Women-only space|Women-only spaces]] for their voices to be heard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTidball founded the women's task force of the [[American Physiological Society]]. She had served as a trustee at several colleges including [[Hood College]], Mount Holyoke, [[Salem College]], [[Skidmore College]], and [[Sweet Briar College]]. She was codirector of the Tidball Center at Hood College.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/175/gallery/m-elizabeth-p-tidball|title=M. Elizabeth P.

She found that graduates from [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] were two to three times more likely to be included for their professional accomplishments than women from [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational college's]]. Criticisms of the study included the lack of controls for [[socioeconomic status]] and [[self-selection bias]] of student populations. The report was publicized in 1973 and continued to be referenced in discussions about [[women's education]] and [[women in the workforce]]. It followed the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] which increased the public debate about the role of women's colleges in [[Society of the United States|American society]]. In the 1970s and 80s, Tidball researched variations of her first study, such as surveys of women in doctoral or medical programs. She coauthored the volume, ''Taking Women Seriously: Lessons and Legacies for Educating the Majority'' with [[Lisa Wolf-Wendel]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nTidball received the president's medal from GW in 1999 and the order of merit from the [[Cathedral Choral Society]]. She was awarded 17 honorary degrees from colleges and universities across the nation.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nTidball sang in the [[alto]] section of the Cathedral Choral Society for almost fifty years. She served as the chorus' first female president from 1982 to 1984 and was a member of the board of trustees. In 1976, she assisted the chorus as it reestablished itself as a legal entity that was financially separate from the [[Washington National Cathedral]]. She helped manage the transition from the founder, [[Paul Callaway]] to the new director, [[J. Reilly Lewis]]. Tidball and her husband, a GWU professor, donated and designed an [[organ stop]] and [[gargoyle]] to the Cathedral.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Tidball's resided in [[Cathedral Heights]] for years. She died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 3, 2014 at the [[Acts Retirement-Life Communities|Buckingham Choice]] in [[Adamstown, Maryland]].

It remained so until the construction of the [[Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]].\n\nUnlike later [[Christianity|Christian]] basilicas, it had no known religious function; it was dedicated to the administration of [[justice]],<ref>https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-architecture/Roman-and-early-Christian#ref488547</ref> [[commerce]] and the presence of the [[emperor]].  It was the largest in [[Rome]] measuring 117 by 55 meters (385&nbsp;x&nbsp;182&nbsp;ft).<ref name=roth/>\n\n==Design & construction==\nThe Basilica Ulpia was composed of a great central [[nave]] with four side aisles, two on each side of the nave.

The center porch framed the main entrance and was the grandest, with 10 columns of yellow marble supporting it. Atop the center porch over an elaborate attic and entablature was a gilt bronze [[quadriga]] (four-horse chariot) escorted by [[Victoria (mythology)|Victories]], with the two flanking porches topped by ''[[Biga (chariot)|bigae]]'' (two-horse chariots).<ref name=\"Virginia\"/> Between the quadrigae were colossal statues of Trajan. The many rows of columns separating the side aisles are a traditional means of structure for basilicas. This method of structure can be traced back to Egyptian [[hypostyle]] Halls.<ref>The Forum of Trajan in Rome: A Study of the Monuments in Brief (2001) by James E. Packer; Roman Imperial Architecture (1981) by J. B. Ward-Perkins; Aulus Gellius: Attic Nights (1927) translated by John C. Rolfe (Loeb Classical Library).</ref> The Basilica Ulpia is very similar to one of the most famous hypostyle halls, [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] at Karnak. \n\nThe apse at the northeast end of the Basilica is labelled ''Libertatis'' on a fragment of the [[Forma Urbis|Marble Plan of Rome]], which suggests that it assumed the functions of the ''Atrium Libertatis'', previously located in the [[Forum Romanum]], the place where slaves were legally [[manumission|manumitted]]. As such there was likely a shrine to [[Libertas]] placed in the apse.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Forum_Trajani.html#basilica_Ulpia| title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome| authors=Samuel B. Platner & Thomas Ashby| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1929| p=237-245}}</ref>\n\nMany of the columns still exist on site, although a large number have fallen. The whole of the construction was decorated with war spoils and trophies from the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]] conducted under the command of [[Trajan]]. The frieze above the entrance was inscribed with the names of the victorious legions involved in the Dacian campaign.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome| author=Rodolfo Lanciani| publisher=Houghton Mifflin| year=1897| p=316}}</ref>\n\nLater, it was used as the architectural prototype by [[Constantine I|Constantine]] as the basis for the layout of the new Christian churches.

It remained so until the construction of the [[Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]].\n\nUnlike later [[Christianity|Christian]] basilicas, it had no known religious function; it was dedicated to the administration of [[justice]],<ref>https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-architecture/Roman-and-early-Christian#ref488547</ref> [[commerce]] and the presence of the [[emperor]].  It was the largest in [[Rome]] measuring 117 by 55 meters (385&nbsp;x&nbsp;182&nbsp;ft).<ref name=roth/>\n\n==Design & construction==\nThe Basilica Ulpia was composed of a great central [[nave]] with four side aisles, two on each side of the nave. The short sides of the structure formed [[apse]]s, while the main entrance was via three doorways on the long east front overlooking the Forum of Trajan, which was one meter below the level of the Basilica.<ref name=\"Virginia\">{{cite article| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/CB-007.html| title=Basilica Ulpia| publisher=archive1.village.virginia.edu| access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> The columns and the walls were of precious marbles; the 50 meter (164&nbsp;ft) high roof was covered by gilded [[bronze]] tiles.\n\nThe east fa\u00e7ade featured a portico with three projecting porches. The center porch framed the main entrance and was the grandest, with 10 columns of yellow marble supporting it. Atop the center porch over an elaborate attic and entablature was a gilt bronze [[quadriga]] (four-horse chariot) escorted by [[Victoria (mythology)|Victories]], with the two flanking porches topped by ''[[Biga (chariot)|Bigae]]'' (two-horse chariots).<ref name=\"Virginia\"/> Between the quadrigae were colossal statues of Trajan. The many rows of columns separating the side aisles are a traditional means of structure for basilicas. This method of structure can be traced back to Egyptian [[hypostyle]] Halls.<ref>The Forum of Trajan in Rome: A Study of the Monuments in Brief (2001) by James E. Packer; Roman Imperial Architecture (1981) by J. B. Ward-Perkins; Aulus Gellius: Attic Nights (1927) translated by John C. Rolfe (Loeb Classical Library).</ref> The Basilica Ulpia is very similar to one of the most famous hypostyle halls, [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] at Karnak. \n\nThe apse at the northeast end of the Basilica is labelled ''Libertatis'' on a fragment of the [[Forma Urbis|Marble Plan of Rome]], which suggests that it assumed the functions of the ''Atrium Libertatis'', previously located in the [[Forum Romanum]], the place where slaves were legally [[manumission|manumitted]]. As such there was likely a shrine to [[Libertas]] placed in the apse.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Forum_Trajani.html#basilica_Ulpia| title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome| authors=Samuel B. Platner & Thomas Ashby| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1929| p=237-245}}</ref>\n\nMany of the columns still exist on site, although a large number have fallen. The whole of the construction was decorated with war spoils and trophies from the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]] conducted under the command of [[Trajan]]. The frieze above the entrance was inscribed with the names of the victorious legions involved in the Dacian campaign.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome| author=Rodolfo Lanciani| publisher=Houghton Mifflin| year=1897| p=316}}</ref>\n\nLater, it was used as the architectural prototype by [[Constantine I|Constantine]] as the basis for the layout of the new Christian churches.
