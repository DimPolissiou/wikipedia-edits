The poem survives only in the [[Exeter Book]], a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century containing approximately one-sixth of all surviving Old English poetry.  Widsith is located between the poems ''[[Vainglory (Old English poem)|Vainglory]]'' and ''[[The Fortunes of Men]]''. Since the donation of the Exeter Book in 1076, it has been housed in [[Exeter Cathedral]] in southwestern England. The poem is for the most part a survey of the people, kings, and heroes of Europe in the [[Germanic Iron Age|Heroic Age]] of Northern Europe.\n\n==Date of original composition==\nThere is some controversy as to when ''Widsith'' was first composed. Some historians, such as [[John D. Niles|John Niles]], argue that the work was invented after [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'s rule to present \"a common glorious past\", while others such as [[Kemp Malone]] have argued that the piece is an authentic transcription of old heroic songs.<ref name=hedeager>{{Cite book|title=Iron Age myth and materiality : an archaeology of Scandinavia, AD 400-1000|last=Lotte|first=Hedeager|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415606042|location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire; New York, NY|oclc=666403125|chapter=Knowledge production reconsidered|pages=177\u2013190}}</ref>{{rp|181}} Among the works appearing in the Exeter Book, there are none quite like ''Widsith'',<ref name=hedeager />{{rp|182}} which may be by far the oldest extant work that gives a historical account of the [[Hl\u00f6\u00f0skvi\u00f0a|Battle of the Goths and the Huns]], recounted as legends in later Scandinavian works such as the [[Hervarar saga]].<ref name=hedeager />{{rp|179}} Archaeologist [[Lotte Hedeager]] argues that ''Widsith'' goes back to [[Migration Age]] history--at least part of it was composed in the 6th century, and that the author demonstrates familiarity with regions outside of Britain, including [[Denmark]] and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast.<ref name=hedeager />{{rp|184\u2013186}} Hedeager is here in agreement with R.H. Hodgkin (see R.H. Hodgkin, ''A History of the Anglo-Saxons'', vol. I, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Pr., 1952), page 29).\n\n==Contents==\nExcluding the introduction of the ''[[scop]]'' Widsith, the closing, and brief comments regarded by some scholars as interpolations, the poem is divided into three 'catalogues', so-called ''[[Thula (poetic genre)|thulas]]''. The first ''thula'' runs through a list of the various kings of renown, both contemporary and ancient (\"Caesar ruled the Greeks\"), the model being '(name of a king) ruled (name of a tribe)'. The second ''thula'' contains the names of the peoples the narrator visited, the model being 'With the (name of a tribe) I was, and with the (name of another tribe).' In the third and final ''thula'', the narrator lists the heroes of myth and legend that he has visited, with the model '(Hero's name) I sought and (hero's name) and (hero's name).'\n\nThe poem refers to a group of people called the ''Wicinga cynn'', which may be the earliest mention of the word \"[[Viking]]\" (lines 47, 59, 80). It closes with a brief comment on the importance and fame offered by poets like Widsith, with many pointed reminders of the munificent generosity offered to tale-singers by patrons \"discerning of songs.\"\n{{Verse translation|attr1=lines 45&ndash;59|\n{{lang|ang|Hro\u00fewulf ond Hro\u00f0gar heoldon lengest\nsibbe \u00e6tsomne suhtorf\u00e6dran,\nsi\u00fe\u00fean hy forwr\u00e6con Wicinga cynn\nond Ingeldes ord forbigdan,\nforheowan aet Heorote Hea\u00f0obeardna \u00ferym.}}\n|\n[[Hro\u00f0ulf]] and [[Hro\u00f0gar]] held the longest\npeace together, uncle and nephew,\nsince they repulsed the Viking-kin\nand [[Ingeld]] to the spear-point made bow,\nhewn at [[Heorot]] [[Hea\u00f0obard]]s' army.}}\n\nThe widely travelled poet Widsith (his name simply means \"far journey\") claims himself to be of the house of the [[Myrging]]s, who had first set out in the retinue of \"Ealhild, the beloved [[Weaving (mythology)|weaver of peace]], from the east out of [[Angeln]] to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, [[Ermanaric|Eormanric]], the cruel troth-breaker.\" The [[Ostrogoth]]{{dubious|date=September 2016}} Eormanric was defeated by the [[Huns]] in the 5th century. It is moot whether Widsith literally intends himself, or poetically means his lineage, either as a Myrging or as a poet, as when \"the fictive speaker [[Deor]] uses the rhetoric of first-person address to insert himself into the same legendary world that he evokes in the earlier parts of the poem through his allusions to [[Wayland the Smith|Weland the smith]], [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] the Goth, Eormanric the Goth, and other legendary figures of the Germanic past.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last= Niles |first= John D. | year= 2003 | jstor=1500445 | title=The Myth of the Anglo-Saxon Oral Poet | journal = Western Folklore | volume = 62|issue= 1/2 |pages= 7\u201361 }}</ref>  Historically, we know that one speaker could not travel to see all of these nations in one lifetime.

The poem survives only in the [[Exeter Book]], a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century containing approximately one-sixth of all surviving Old English poetry.  Widsith is located between the poems ''[[Vainglory (Old English poem)|Vainglory]]'' and ''[[The Fortunes of Men]]''. Since the donation of the Exeter Book in 1076, it has been housed in [[Exeter Cathedral]] in southwestern England. The poem is for the most part a survey of the people, kings, and heroes of Europe in the [[Germanic Iron Age|Heroic Age]] of Northern Europe.\n\n==Date of original composition==\nThere is some controversy as to when ''Widsith'' was first composed. Some historians, such as [[John D. Niles|John Niles]], argue that the work was invented after [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'s rule to present \"a common glorious past\", while others such as [[Kemp Malone]] have argued that the piece is an authentic transcription of old heroic songs.<ref name=hedeager>{{Cite book|title=Iron Age myth and materiality : an archaeology of Scandinavia, AD 400-1000|last=Lotte|first=Hedeager|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415606042|location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire; New York, NY|oclc=666403125|chapter=Knowledge production reconsidered|pages=177\u2013190}}</ref>{{rp|181}} Among the works appearing in the Exeter Book, there are none quite like ''Widsith'',<ref name=hedeager />{{rp|182}} which may be by far the oldest extant work that gives a historical account of the [[Hl\u00f6\u00f0skvi\u00f0a|Battle of the Goths and the Huns]], recounted as legends in later Scandinavian works such as the [[Hervarar saga]].<ref name=hedeager />{{rp|179}} Archaeologist [[Lotte Hedeager]] argues that ''Widsith'' goes back to [[Migration Age]] history--at least part of it was composed in the 6th century, and that the author demonstrates familiarity with regions outside of Britain, including [[Denmark]] and the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast.<ref name=hedeager />{{rp|184\u2013186}} Hedeager is here in agreement with R.H. Hodgkin (see R.H. Hodgkin, ''A History of the Anglo-Saxons'', vol. I, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Pr., 1952), page 29).\n\n==Contents==\nExcluding the introduction of the ''[[scop]]'' Widsith, the closing, and brief comments regarded by some scholars as interpolations, the poem is divided into three 'catalogues', so-called ''[[Thula (poetic genre)|thulas]]''. The first ''thula'' runs through a list of the various kings of renown, both contemporary and ancient (\"Caesar ruled the Greeks\"), the model being '(name of a king) ruled (name of a tribe)'. The second ''thula'' contains the names of the peoples the narrator visited, the model being 'With the (name of a tribe) I was, and with the (name of another tribe).' In the third and final ''thula'', the narrator lists the heroes of myth and legend that he has visited, with the model '(Hero's name) I sought and (hero's name) and (hero's name).'\n\nThe poem refers to a group of people called the ''Wicinga cynn'', which may be the earliest mention of the word \"[[Viking]]\" (lines 47, 59, 80).
