After Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, triggering World War II, the regime set up [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] to [[Racial segregation|segregate]] Jews from the rest of the population. Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe.\n\nThe segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \"[[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]\", discussed by senior Nazi officials at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|captured territories in the East]], all anti-Jewish measures were radicalised. Under the coordination of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], with directions from the highest leadership of the [[Nazi Party]], killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout occupied Europe, and within territories controlled by [[Axis powers|Germany's allies]]. Paramilitary [[death squads]] called [[Einsatzgruppen]], in cooperation with the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] and local collaborators, murdered around 1.3&nbsp;million Jews in mass shootings and pogroms between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942, victims were being deported from ghettos across Europe in sealed [[Holocaust trains|freight trains]] to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, they were worked to death or gassed.

He compared the idea of \"the guilt of the Germans\" to the Nazi idea of \"the guilt of the Jews\", and argued that the focus on the Final Solution overlooked the Nazi's euthanasia program and treatment of Soviet POWs, as well as post-war issues such as the wars in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghanistan]]. Comparing [[Auschwitz]] to the [[Gulag]], he suggested that the Holocaust was a response to Hitler's fear of the Soviet Union: \"Did the Gulag Archipelago not precede Auschwitz? Was the [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|Bolshevik murder of an entire class]] not the logical and factual ''prius'' of the 'racial murder' of National Socialism?&nbsp;...

[[Richard J. Evans]] argued in 2015:\n\n{{quote|Thus although the Nazi 'Final Solution' was one genocide among many, it had features that made it stand out from all the rest as well. Unlike all the others it was bounded neither by space nor by time. It was launched not against a local or regional obstacle, but at a world-enemy seen as operating on a global scale. It was bound to an even larger plan of racial reordering and reconstruction involving further genocidal killing on an almost unimaginable scale, aimed, however, at clearing the way in a particular region&nbsp;\u2013 Eastern Europe&nbsp;\u2013 for a further struggle against the Jews and those the Nazis regarded as their puppets. It was set in motion by ideologues who saw world history in racial terms. It was, in part, carried out by industrial methods.

Following [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)|appointment as Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933, the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed \"undesirable\", starting with [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] on 22 March 1933.<ref>For the date, see {{harvnb|Marcuse|2001|p=21}}.</ref> After the passing of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 24 March,{{sfn|Stackelberg|Winkle|2002|pp=141\u2013143}} which gave Hitler [[plenary power]]s, the government began isolating Jews from civil society; this included [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycotting Jewish businesses]] in April 1933 and enacting the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in September 1935. On 9\u201310 November 1938, eight months after Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked, smashed or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (the \"Night of Broken Glass\"). After Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, triggering World War II, the regime set up [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] to [[Racial segregation|segregate]] Jews from the rest of the population. Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe.\n\nThe segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \"[[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]\", discussed by senior Nazi officials at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|captured territories in the East]], all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized. Under the coordination of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], with directions from the highest leadership of the [[Nazi Party]], killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout occupied Europe, and within territories controlled by [[Axis powers|Germany's allies]].

Germany proper, including the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], will have to be handled first due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities.

{"title_page": "Titles of Mary", "text_new": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is related to four different dogmas and numerous Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles, and arts witness her prominent role at the site of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is narrated that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man,\" meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit into her body, the degree of her participation in the life of the Holy Trinity, as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary.

Furthermore, she is related to four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is narrated that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man,\" meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

A new attempt led to the Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian [[Serbian campaign of World War I#1915|conquest of Serbia]] and [[Montenegrin Campaign of World War I|Montenegro]]. That led to the Serbian army to [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|retreat through Albania]] and to be evacuated to [[Salonika]] by the Allies. There, they joined with the Franco-British [[Allied Army of the Orient]] and fought a protracted [[trench war]] against Bulgarian forces on the [[Macedonian front]]. The allied army was stationed in Greece, which resulted in the [[National Schism]] on whether Greece should join the Allies or remain neutral, which would benefit the Central Powers. Greece eventually joined the Allies in 1917. In September 1918, the [[Vardar Offensive]] broke through the lines of Bulgaria, which was [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|forced to surrender]], leading to the [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro]].\n\n==Overview==\nA major cause of the war was the hostility between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, which made some of the earliest fighting take place between them. Serbia held out against Austria-Hungary for more than a year before it was conquered in late 1915.\n\n[[Dalmatia]] was a strategic region during the war that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war upon agreeing to the [[Treaty of London, 1915]], which guaranteed Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia.\n\nIn 1917, Greece entered the war for the Allieds, and in 1918, the multinational [[Allied Army of the Orient]], based in northern [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], finally launched an offensive, which drove Bulgaria to seek peace, recaptured Serbia and halted only at the border of [[Hungary]] in November 1918.\n\n==Serbian\u2013Montenegrin campaign==\n{{Main|Serbian campaign of World War I|Montenegrin Campaign of World War I}}\n\nThe Serbian army managed to to rebuff the larger [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] because Russia assisted by invading from the north. In 1915, Austro-Hungary placed additional soldiers in the south front and succeed in engaging Bulgaria as an ally.\n\nSoon, the Serbian army was attacked from the north and the east, forcing a [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|retreat to Greece]]. Despite the loss, the retreat was successful, and the Serbian army remained operational in Greece with a newly-established base.\n\n==Albania==\n{{Main|Albania during World War I}}\n\n[[File:Vlora zur Zeit der italienischen Besatzung 1916-1920.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Italian soldiers in [[Vlor\u00eb]], [[Albania]] during [[World War I]].

The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.\n\nBulgaria, recuperating from the [[Balkan Wars]], sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking [[Ni\u0161|Nish]], Serbia's war capital in November 5), advancing into [[Greek Macedonia]], and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The [[February Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution of February 1917]] had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.\n\nIn September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the [[Macedonian front]] in the [[Vardar Offensive]]. While Bulgarian forces [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|stopped them]] in [[Dojran]] and they didn't proceed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.\n\nIn order to head off the revolutionaries, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] abdicated in favour of his son [[Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).\n\n==Macedonian front==\nIn 1915, the Austro-Hungarians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat through Montenegro and Albania, with only 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reaching the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and evacuated to Greece by Allied ships.\n\nThe [[Macedonian front]] stabilized roughly around the Greek border after the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force that had landed in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]]. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards [[Salonika]], because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central Powers.\n\nIn 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], who led a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, [[Vardar Offensive|attacked out of Greece]]. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austro-Hungarian forces that tried to halt his offensive.\n\nBy October 1918, his army had [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|recaptured all of Serbia]] and was preparing to invade Hungary proper, but the offensive was halted by the Hungarian leadership offering to surrender in November 1918.\n\n==Results==\nThe French and British each kept six divisions on the Greek frontier from 1916 to the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia's conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence did not produce major effects and so they mobilized the useful forces to the Western Front. For nearly three years, those divisions accomplished essentially nothing and tied down only half of the Bulgarian army, which would not have gone far from Bulgaria anyway.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn mid 1918, led by General Franchet d'Esperey, those forces were added to conduct a major offensive on the south flank of the Quadruplice (8 French division, 6 British division, 1 Italian division, 12 Serbian division<ref>Bernard SCHNETZLER Les erreurs strat\u00e9giques pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre Mondiale, ECONOMICA, 2011 {{ISBN|2717852255}}</ref>). After the successul offensive launched on the 10th September 1918, they freed Belgrade and forced Bulgaria to Armistice on 29th September. That had a significative effect by threatening Austria-Hungary (which agreed to an rmistice on 4 November 1918) and then the German political leadership.\n\nIn fact, Keegan argued that \"the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the [[Megali Idea|\"Great Idea\"]] - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=World War I|last=Keegan|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2000|isbn=0375700455|location=|pages=307}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=D.

The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.\n\nBulgaria, recuperating from the [[Balkan Wars]], sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking [[Ni\u0161|Nish]], Serbia's war capital in November 5), advancing into [[Greek Macedonia]], and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The [[February Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution of February 1917]] had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.\n\nIn September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the [[Macedonian front]] in the [[Vardar Offensive]]. While Bulgarian forces [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|stopped them]] in [[Dojran]] and they didn't proceed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.\n\nIn order to head off the revolutionaries, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] abdicated in favour of his son [[Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).\n\n==Macedonian front==\nIn 1915, the Austro-Hungarians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat through Montenegro and Albania, with only 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reaching the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and evacuated to Greece by Allied ships.\n\nThe [[Macedonian front]] stabilized roughly around the Greek border after the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force that had landed in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]]. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards [[Salonika]], because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central Powers.\n\nIn 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], who led a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, [[Vardar Offensive|attacked out of Greece]]. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austro-Hungarian forces that tried to halt his offensive.\n\nBy October 1918, his army had [[liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|recaptured all of Serbia]] and was preparing to invade Hungary proper, but the offensive was halted by the Hungarian leadership offering to surrender in November 1918.\n\n==Results==\nThe French and British each kept six divisions on the Greek frontier from 1916 to the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia's conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence did not produce major effects and so they mobilized the useful forces to the Western Front. For nearly three years, those divisions accomplished essentially nothing and tied down only half of the Bulgarian army, which would not have gone far from Bulgaria anyway.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn mid 1918, led by General Franchet d'Esperey, those forces were added to conduct a major offensive on the south flank of the Quadruplice (8 French division, 6 British division, 1 Italian division, 12 Serbian division<ref>Bernard SCHNETZLER Les erreurs strat\u00e9giques pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre Mondiale, ECONOMICA, 2011 {{ISBN|2717852255}}</ref>). After the successul offensive launched on the 10th September 1918, they freed Belgrade and forced Bulgaria to Armistice on 29th September. That had a significative effect by threatening Austria-Hungary (which agreed to an rmistice on 4 November 1918) and then the German political leadership.\n\nIn fact, Keegan argued that \"the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the [[Megali Idea|\"Great Idea\"]] - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=World War I|last=Keegan|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2000|isbn=0375700455|location=|pages=307}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=D.
