Etch Wellcome V0035701.jpg|thumb|The arrest of Neo-Adamites in a public square in Amsterdam]]\n\nThe '''Adamites''', or '''Adamians''', were adherents of an [[History of Christianity|Early Christian]] group in [[Early centers of Christianity#North Africa|North Africa]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd]], [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd]] and [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th centuries]]. They wore no clothing during their religious services. There were later reports of similar sects in [[Central Europe]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]].\n\n== Ancient Adamites ==\n\nThe obscure sect, dating probably from the 2nd century, professed to have regained [[Adam]]'s primeval innocence. Various accounts are given of their origin. Some have thought them to have been an offshoot of the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratian]] [[gnosticism|Gnostics]], who professed a sensual [[mysticism]] and a complete emancipation from the moral law. [[Theodoret]] (Haer. Fab., I, 6) held this view of them, and identified them with the licentious sects whose practices are described by [[Clement of Alexandria]]. Others, on the contrary, consider them to have been misguided [[asceticism|ascetic]]s, who strove to extirpate carnal desires by a return to simpler manners, and by the abolition of marriage.\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] mention the Adamites by name, and describe their practices. They called their church \"[[Paradise]]\", claiming that its members were re-established in [[Adam and Eve]]'s state of original innocence. Accordingly, they practiced \"holy [[nudism]]\", rejected the form of [[marriage]] as foreign to Eden, saying it would never have existed but for sin, lived in absolute [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]], holding that, whatever they did, their actions could be neither good nor bad.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adamites|volume=1|page=174}}</ref>\n\n==Neo-Adamites==\nPractices similar to those just described appeared in Europe several times in later ages. During the [[Middle Ages]] the doctrines of this obscure sect, which did not itself exist long, were revived:<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> in the 13th century in the [[Netherlands]] by the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] and the [[Taborite]]s in [[Bohemia]], and, in the 14th century, by some German [[Beguines and Beghards|Beghards]]. Everywhere they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches.\n\nThe Taborite movement was started in 1419 in opposition to the authority of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. One sect of Taborites, the  Bohemian Adamites, dissociated themselves from other Taborites and took up the practice of going naked through towns and villages. They preached that \"God dwelt in the Saints of the Last Days\" and considered exclusive marriage to be a sin. The historian [[Norman Cohn]] observed: \"Whereas the Taborites were strictly monogamous, in this sect free love seems to have been the rule. The Adamites declared that the chaste were unworthy to enter the Messianic kingdom ... The sect was much given to ritual naked dances held around a fire. Indeed, these people seemed to have spent much of their time naked, ignoring the heat and cold and claiming to be in the state of innocence enjoined by Adam and Eve.\" Cohn also commented that the Adamites were criticised by other Taborites for \"never thinking of earning their own living by the work of their hands\".<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=From the Observer archive, 17 March 1974: the naked truth about streaking|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/22/naked-truth-about-seventies-streaking-craze|author=Andrew Wilson|date=22 March 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe Beghards became the [[Picards]] of Bohemia, who took possession of an island in the river [[Ne\u017e\u00e1rka]], and lived communally, practicing social and religious nudity, [[free love]] and rejecting marriage and individual ownership of property. [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]], the Hussite leader, nearly exterminated the sect in 1421.<ref>[[Konstantin von H\u00f6fler]], ''Geschichtsquellen B\u00f6hmens'', I, 414, 431.</ref> In the following year, the sect was widely spread over Bohemia and [[Moravia]], and especially hated by the [[Hussites]] (whom they resembled in hatred toward the hierarchy) because the Adamites rejected [[transubstantiation]], the [[priesthood]] and the [[Eucharist|Supper]].<ref>{{cite Americana|wstitle=Adamites|year=1920|inline=1}}</ref> The strife between the Adamites and the Taborites is dramatized in ''[[Against All]]'', the third part of [[Otakar V\u00e1vra]]'s Hussite film trilogy (1958).{{sfn|Hames|2009|pp=21-}}\n\nThe splintering of Protestantism during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] in the 17th century saw Adamites recorded in the ''Catalogue of the Several Sects and Opinions in England.''<ref name=\"Morrill2000\">{{cite book|last= Goldie|first=Mark|editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrill|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xe0YCV2ad8gC&pg=PA293|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289327-7|chapter=The Search for Religious Liberty 1640-1690}}</ref>  \n\nA revival of these doctrines took place in Bohemia in the region of [[Chrudim]] after 1781, owing to the edict of toleration issued by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

Some have thought them to have been an offshoot of the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratian]] [[gnosticism|Gnostics]], who professed a sensual [[mysticism]] and a complete emancipation from the moral law. [[Theodoret]] (Haer. Fab., I, 6) held this view of them, and identified them with the licentious sects whose practices are described by [[Clement of Alexandria]]. Others, on the contrary, consider them to have been misguided [[asceticism|ascetic]]s, who strove to extirpate carnal desires by a return to simpler manners, and by the abolition of marriage.\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] mention the Adamites by name, and describe their practices. They called their church \"[[Paradise]]\", claiming that its members were re-established in [[Adam and Eve]]'s state of original innocence. Accordingly, they practiced \"holy [[nudism]]\", rejected the form of [[marriage]] as foreign to Eden, saying it would never have existed but for sin, lived in absolute [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]], holding that, whatever they did, and their actions could be neither good nor bad.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Adamites|volume=1|page=174}}</ref>\n\n==Neo-Adamites==\nPractices similar to those just described appeared in Europe several times in later ages. During the [[Middle Ages]] the doctrines of this obscure sect, which did not itself exist long, were revived:<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> in the 13th century in the [[Netherlands]] by the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] and the [[Taborite]]s in [[Bohemia]], and, in the 14th century, by some German [[Beguines and Beghards|Beghards]]. Everywhere they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches.\n\nThe Taborite movement was started in 1419 in opposition to the authority of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. One sect of Taborites, the  Bohemian Adamites, dissociated themselves from other Taborites and took up the practice of going naked through towns and villages. They preached that \"God dwelt in the Saints of the Last Days\" and considered exclusive marriage to be a sin. The historian [[Norman Cohn]] observed: \"Whereas the Taborites were strictly monogamous, in this sect free love seems to have been the rule. The Adamites declared that the chaste were unworthy to enter the Messianic kingdom ... The sect was much given to ritual naked dances held around a fire. Indeed, these people seemed to have spent much of their time naked, ignoring the heat and cold and claiming to be in the state of innocence enjoined by Adam and Eve.\" Cohn also commented that the Adamites were criticised by other Taborites for \"never thinking of earning their own living by the work of their hands\".<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=From the Observer archive, 17 March 1974: the naked truth about streaking|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/mar/22/naked-truth-about-seventies-streaking-craze|author=Andrew Wilson|date=22 March 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe Beghards became the [[Picards]] of Bohemia, who took possession of an island in the river [[Ne\u017e\u00e1rka]], and lived communally, practicing social and religious nudity, [[free love]] and rejecting marriage and individual ownership of property. [[Jan \u017di\u017eka]], the Hussite leader, nearly exterminated the sect in 1421.<ref>[[Konstantin von H\u00f6fler]], ''Geschichtsquellen B\u00f6hmens'', I, 414, 431.</ref> In the following year, the sect was widely spread over Bohemia and [[Moravia]], and especially hated by the [[Hussites]] (whom they resembled in hatred toward the hierarchy) because the Adamites rejected [[transubstantiation]], the [[priesthood]] and the [[Eucharist|Supper]].<ref>{{cite Americana|wstitle=Adamites|year=1920|inline=1}}</ref> The strife between the Adamites and the Taborites is dramatized in ''[[Against All]]'', the third part of [[Otakar V\u00e1vra]]'s Hussite film trilogy (1958).{{sfn|Hames|2009|pp=21-}}\n\nThe splintering of Protestantism during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] in the 17th century saw Adamites recorded in the ''Catalogue of the Several Sects and Opinions in England.''<ref name=\"Morrill2000\">{{cite book|last= Goldie|first=Mark|editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrill|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xe0YCV2ad8gC&pg=PA293|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289327-7|chapter=The Search for Religious Liberty 1640-1690}}</ref>  \n\nA revival of these doctrines took place in Bohemia in the region of [[Chrudim]] after 1781, owing to the edict of toleration issued by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. This secret group of Adamites was first mentioned in 1783, then again in 1849. However, a letter to the \"Neues Wiener Tagblatt\" in 1874, which claimed to be authored by Adamites in Vienna, appears to be a hoax.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Adamskostuum]]\n* [[Anarchist naturism]]\n* [[Christian naturism]]\n* [[Freedomites]]\n* [[Restorationism]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Catholic |wstitle = Adamites}}\n* {{cite book |ref = {{sfnref|Hames|2009}} |last = Hames |first = Peter |title = Czech and Slovak Cinema: Theme and Tradition |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xcFvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT21 |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 978-0-7486-8683-4}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Nudity}}\n\n[[Category:Nudity in religion]]\n[[Category:Christian communities]]\n[[Category:Christian radicalism]]\n", "name_user": "Packer1028", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamites"}
