The station is owned by [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]-based [[Morris Multimedia]]. WMGT-TV's studios are located on Poplar Street in downtown Macon, and its transmitter is located on [[Georgia State Route 87|SR 87]]/[[U.S. Route 23 in Georgia|US 23]]/[[U.S. Route 129 Alternate (Macon, Georgia)|US 129 ALT]] (Golden Isles Highway) along the [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb]]\u2013[[Twiggs County, Georgia|Twiggs]] county line.\n\n==History==\nThe station first signed on the air on September 30, 1968, as '''WCWB-TV'''. It was the first commercial television station to start up in the Macon [[media market|market]] since [[CBS]] affiliate [[WMAZ-TV]] (channel 13) debuted on September 27, 1953, fifteen years and three days earlier. The station was founded by [[Dothan, Alabama]] broadcaster and perennial [[Alabama]] political candidate [[Charles Woods (Alabama)|Charles Woods]], who owned the station for about six years. WCWB's original studio facilities were located at its transmitter site, located {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Macon, on what local residents refer to as the \"[[Cochran, Georgia|Cochran]] Short Route\". Channel 41 has been an NBC affiliate since its debut; however, unlike many stations in (then) two-station markets, WCWB did not assume a secondary affiliation with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. During the 1970s and early 1980s, select ABC programs continued to air on WMAZ instead, during time periods when the station was not carrying CBS programming; Macon would not receive a full-time ABC affiliate of its own until [[WGXA]] (channel 24, now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) signed on in April 1982. Woods sold channel 41 to a local group known as Bibb Television, Inc., led by his then-station manager, F. E. Busby, in 1974. <ref>[http://www.davidgleason.com/Broadcasting%201975%20Yearbook%20Page%20Range%20Guide_files/201-300%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201975-3.pdf ''Broadcasting Yearbook 1975'']</ref> The local group proved no more successful at making WCWB profitable than Woods had been, and current owner [[Morris Multimedia]] bought the station from Bibb four years later, in 1978.\n\nChannel 41's early years of struggle were caused in large part because the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) had implemented the [[All-Channel Receiver Act]] only four years before the station signed on the air. Macon is a fairly large market geographically, and UHF stations are usually not received well across wide areas, even though much of [[central Georgia|Middle Georgia]]'s terrain is fairly level. Many area households probably did not upgrade their sets to newer UHF-compatible models (or purchase expensive converters) until well into the early 1970s, meaning that, in WCWB's first years of operation, some viewers could not watch the station even had they wanted to, a situation greatly handicapping the young station's promotional efforts. Further complicating matters, [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]]\u2014then an NBC affiliate\u2014put out at least a [[Broadcast range|grade B]] signal into much of the northern portion of the market, while [[WALB-TV]] in [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]] and [[WSAV-TV]] in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], both on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band, could be picked up in the respective portions of the southwestern and southeastern portions of the market. As a result, many (if not most) viewers in Middle Georgia did not get a clear picture from the station until [[cable television|cable]] arrived in the area in the late 1970s. Even so, most Middle Georgia viewers instinctively turned to WMAZ out of long-standing habits for years, ignoring WCWB even after UHF compatibility became universal on sets (the only other UHF station available then was WDCO-TV, a satellite of [[Georgia Public Broadcasting|Georgia Public Television]]).\n\nThe station changed its call letters to '''WMGT''' (for \"<u>M</u>iddle <u>G</u>eorgia <u>T</u>elevision\") on December 1, 1983, to reflect the area of Georgia that it serves (the old WCWB call letters would later be used by a [[Pittsburgh]] TV station from 1998 to 2006). In 2000, the station moved its operations into a renovated two-story warehouse in Downtown Macon, which promised to add to the revitalization of the historic area and signify future growth for the station. Morris maintains its corporate headquarters on the second floor of WMGT's studio facility. The station's legal call sign was modified in 2003 to include a \"-TV\" suffix to disambiguate itself from a [[Minnesota]] radio station that also held the WMGT calls. On April 3, 2006, WMGT retired its \"41\" logo (which resembled the 1993 to 2001 logo used by fellow NBC affiliate and former [[sister station]] [[KARK-TV]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]) and \"41 NBC\" branding, introducing a new logo and rebranding as \"Today's MGT\"; the \"41 NBC\" brand was restored on March 23, 2009 with the introduction of a new logo.\n\n==WMGT-DT2==\n'''WMGT-DT2''', branded as '''Bounce TV Macon''', [[Bounce TV]]-affiliated second [[digital subchannel]] of WMGT-TV, broadcasting in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] on UHF digital channel 30.2 (or virtual channel 41.2 via [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]]). The subchannel is also affiliated with the [[MyNetworkTV]] programming service\n\nThe subchannel first signed on the air on July 6, 2009. Prior to its launch, MyNetworkTV programming was previously carried as a secondary affiliation on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WGXA]] (channel 24) beginning with the service's launch on September 5, 2006. In the summer of 2011, WMGT-DT2 was rebranded as \"My41.2\".\n\nBy March 2020, the [[Bounce TV]] programming once seen on Channel 41.3 was merged into a secondary affiliation alongside MyNetworkTV on WMGT-DT2, replacing most of the programming on the subchannel outside of the MyNetworkTV lineup with the [[Bounce TV]] schedule; the MyNetworkTV programming also moved to the [[graveyard slot]] in favor of Bounce TV's primetime offerings, an increasingly common fate for the former.<ref>[http://wmgt.titantv.com/apg/ttv.aspx TitanTV Query]</ref>\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The programming service had previously been carried in the Macon market as a secondary affiliation on Fox affiliate WGXA beginning with MyNetworkTV's launch on September 5, 2006.\n\nOn July 2, 2015, Bounce TV was moved from WPGA-TV to WMGT-DT3, while ThisTV network took its place on WPGA-DT3 which was previously on WPGA-LP channel 50.\n\nIn mid-March 2016, WMGT-TV began carrying Escape (now [[Court TV Mystery]]) on digital subchannel 41.4.\n\nIn mid-October 2016, WMGT-TV began carrying [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]] on digital subchannel 41.5.\n\n==Programming==\n[[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast on WMGT include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Judge Judy]]'', ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' and ''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]''. Syndicated programs on WMGT-DT2 include ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wmgt news 2010.png|thumb|right|Former news open.{{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 12 April 2016}}]] -->\nWMGT-TV presently broadcasts 18 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 3\u00bd hours each weekday and a half hour on Sundays); unlike most NBC affiliates, the station does not broadcast any newscasts in the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot on weekdays, Saturday evenings, and by association to the latter, early evening newscasts on weekends. In addition, the station produces an additional five hours of newscasts each week (with one hour each on weekdays) for WMGT-DT2.\n\nThe station began producing newscasts at its 1968 inception. However, due to the problems mentioned above caused by WMAZ's dominance of the market, WCWB's newscasts struggled in the ratings for years, and were mostly discontinued by the early 1970s. It made a modest attempt at newscasts again later in the decade. However, within a few months following its start in 1982, WGXA's newscasts surged to second place in the market (behind WMAZ), because its news product was perceived as far more modern than that of the newscasts seen on WCWB. Once again, due to low viewership, channel 41 shut down its news department in 1992. For the next 12 years, it was one of the few Big Three affiliates that did not air any newscasts at all.\n\nThe station relaunched its news operation on [[Labor Day|September 6]], 2004, as [[Hurricane Frances|Tropical Storm Frances]] moved through the [[Southeastern United States]]. At that time, WMGT began producing three half-hour newscasts that aired at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., 5:30 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. When the news department was re-established, WMGT was among the first stations in the country to maintain a completely digital newsgathering operation.\n\nWith cable now having leveled the playing field somewhat by rendering the UHF reception issue largely moot, WMGT gradually expanded its newscasts over the next few years. The station eventually expanded its weekday morning newscast to its current two-hour length, running from 5:00 to 7:00&nbsp;a.m., in October 2012. The early evening newscast was later moved to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. On July 6, 2009, the station began producing a half-hour primetime newscast each weeknight at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. for WMGT-DT2, and also began airing a rebroadcast of its 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In October 2012, the station expanded its 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast to Sunday evenings. Around this time, the station began airing a rebroadcast of its morning newscast on WMGT-DT2 from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. On September 16, 2013, the station debuted a half-hour midday newscast at 11 a.m. called \"41 Today\", a non-traditional news program that places a heavy emphasis on community events, consumer and lifestyle features and weather forecast. On February 18, 2014, WMGT became the third station in the Macon market (after [[WMUB-LD|WRWR-LD]] (channel 38) and WMAZ-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; however the newscasts on WMGT-DT2 were not included in the upgrade, instead broadcasting them in [[widescreen]] [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]] in the subchannel's native [[480p]] resolution format.\n\n===Notable current on&ndash;air staff===\n* [[Bill Shanks]] - ''The End Zone'' Host\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Taylor Terrell]] (deceased)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://41nbc.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WMGT-TV}}\n\n{{Macon TV}}\n{{NBC Georgia}}\n{{MNTV Georgia}}\n{{Morris Multimedia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wmgt-Tv}}\n[[Category:Television stations in Macon, Georgia|MGT-TV]]\n[[Category:NBC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Bounce TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:MyNetworkTV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates]]\n[[Category:Morris Multimedia]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1968]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|NBC affiliate in Macon, Georgia}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = WMGT-TV\n| city                     = \n| station_logo             = [[File:Wmgt 2009.png|250px]]\n| station_branding         = 41 NBC ''(general)''<br/>''41 NBC News''<br/>My 41.2 Macon ''(DT2-primary)''<br/>Bounce TV Macon ''(DT2-secondary)''\n| station_slogan           = ''Clear.

However, due to the problems mentioned above caused by WMAZ's dominance of the market, WCWB's newscasts struggled in the ratings for years, and were mostly discontinued by the early 1970s. It made a modest attempt at newscasts again later in the decade. However, within a few months following its start in 1982, WGXA's newscasts surged to second place in the market (behind WMAZ), because its news product was perceived as far more modern than that of the newscasts seen on WCWB. Once again, due to low viewership, channel 41 shut down its news department in 1992. For the next 12 years, it was one of the few Big Three affiliates that did not air any newscasts at all.\n\nThe station relaunched its news operation on [[Labor Day|September 6]], 2004, as [[Hurricane Frances|Tropical Storm Frances]] moved through the [[Southeastern United States]]. At that time, WMGT began producing three half-hour newscasts that aired at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., 5:30 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. When the news department was re-established, WMGT was among the first stations in the country to maintain a completely digital newsgathering operation.\n\nWith cable now having leveled the playing field somewhat by rendering the UHF reception issue largely moot, WMGT gradually expanded its newscasts over the next few years. The station eventually expanded its weekday morning newscast to its current two-hour length, running from 5:00 to 7:00&nbsp;a.m., in October 2012. The early evening newscast was later moved to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. On July 6, 2009, the station began producing a half-hour primetime newscast each weeknight at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. for WMGT-DT2, and also began airing a rebroadcast of its 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In October 2012, the station expanded its 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast to Sunday evenings. Around this time, the station began airing a rebroadcast of its morning newscast on WMGT-DT2 from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. On September 16, 2013, the station debuted a half-hour midday newscast at 11 a.m. called \"41 Today\", a non-traditional news program that places a heavy emphasis on community events, consumer and lifestyle features and weather forecast. On February 18, 2014, WMGT became the third station in the Macon market (after [[WMUB-LD|WRWR-LD]] (channel 38) and WMAZ-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]; however the newscasts on WMGT-DT2 were not included in the upgrade, instead broadcasting them in [[widescreen]] [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]] in the subchannel's native [[480p]] resolution format.\n\n===Notable current on&ndash;air staff===\n* [[Bill Shanks]] - ''The End Zone'' Host\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Taylor Terrell]] (deceased)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://41nbc.com/}}\n*{{TVQ|WMGT-TV}}\n\n{{Macon TV}}\n{{NBC Georgia}}\n{{MNTV Georgia}}\n{{Morris Multimedia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wmgt-Tv}}\n[[Category:Television stations in Macon, Georgia|MGT-TV]]\n[[Category:NBC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Bounce TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:MyNetworkTV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates]]\n[[Category:Morris Multimedia]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1968]]\n[[Category:1968 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n", "name_user": "Mrschimpf", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDigital channels", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMGT-TV"}

Produced and directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it is the 21st [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. The story follows the adventures of [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]], [[Little John]], and the inhabitants of [[Nottingham]] as they fight against the excessive taxation of [[John, King of England|Prince John]], and Robin Hood wins the hand of [[Maid Marian]]. The film features the voices of [[Brian Bedford]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Peter Ustinov]], [[Pat Buttram]], [[Monica Evans]], and [[Carole Shelley]]. \n\nThe idea to adapt ''Robin Hood'' into an animated feature dated back to [[Walt Disney]]'s interest in the tale of [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] during his first full-length feature production, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). The idea was repeatedly shelved until writer and production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] incorporated ideas from it in a pitch of the legend of [[Robin Hood]] using [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals rather than people during the production of ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970).\n\n''Robin Hood'' was released on November 8, 1973 to box office success. It was initially received positively by film critics who praised the voice cast, animation, and humor yet its critical reception became gradually mixed since its release. The film has also gained a fan following. \n\nOn March 2020, it was announced that a live-action styled adaptation was in development on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 561 words. -->\nThe film is narrated by the [[rooster]] [[Alan-a-Dale]], who explains that [[Robin Hood]] and [[Little John]] live in [[Sherwood Forest]], robbing from the rich and giving to the poor townsfolk of [[Nottingham]]. Meanwhile, [[John, King of England|Prince John]], who is king of England, sends his lead henchman, the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], to catch the two but he fails every time. Meanwhile, Prince John and his assistant Sir Hiss, arrive in Nottingham. Sir Hiss hypnotized Prince John's brother [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] to go off on the [[Crusades]], allowing Prince John to take the throne. Unfortunately, the prince is greedy and immature, even sucking his thumb whenever his [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|mother]] is mentioned. Robin and Little John rob Prince John by disguising themselves as fortune tellers, prompting the prince to put a bounty on their heads and makes the Sheriff his personal tax collector.\n\nThe Sheriff taxes [[Friar Tuck]] and a family of rabbits. However, Robin gives back some money to the rabbits, giving his hat and archery kit to the young rabbit Skippy for his birthday. Skippy and his friends test out the archery kit, but Skippy fires an arrow into the grounds of [[Maid Marian]]'s castle. The children sneak inside, meeting Maid Marian and her attendant Lady Kluck. Maid Marian reveals she and Robin were childhood sweethearts but they have not seen one another for years. Friar Tuck visits Robin and Little John, explaining that Prince John is hosting an archery tournament, and the winner will receive a kiss from Maid Marian. Robin agrees to participate in the tournament disguised as a [[stork]] whilst Little John disguises himself as the Duke of Chutney to get near Prince John. Sir Hiss discovers Robin's identity but is trapped in a barrel of ale by Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale. Robin wins the tournament, but Prince John exposes him and has him arrested for execution despite Maid Marian's pleas.\n\nLittle John threatens Prince John leading to a fight between Robin, Little John, Maid Marian, Lady Kluck and Prince John's soldiers. In the forest, Robin and Maid Marian fall in love again as the townsfolk sing a song mocking Prince John, describing him as the \"Phony King of England\". Enraged by the song, Prince John triples the taxes, imprisoning most of the townsfolk who cannot or refuse to pay their taxes. The Sheriff visits Friar Tuck's church to steal from the poor box, enraging Friar Tuck who viciously attacks him until he too is arrested. Prince John plans to hang Friar Tuck to lure in Robin and kill him. Robin and Little John sneak in, with Little John managing to free all of the prisoners whilst Robin steals Prince John's taxes, but Sir Hiss awakens to find Robin fleeing.\n\nChaos follows as Robin and the others try to escape to Sherwood Forest. The Sheriff corners Robin after he is forced to return to rescue Skippy's younger sister, setting fire to Prince John's castle and causing Robin to leap from a tower into the moat below. Little John and Skippy watch as the moat is pelted with arrows and Robin is apparently shot and drowned, only for him to emerge unharmed after using a reed as a breathing tube. Prince John despairs and is driven into a blind rage when Sir Hiss points out his mother's castle is on fire. Later, King Richard returns to England, placing his brother and his cohorts under arrest and allows Robin and Maid Marian to be married and leave Nottingham with Little John and Skippy in tow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brian Bedford]] as [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]], a gifted archer who is seen doing good for the townspeople. He is portrayed as a [[fox]].\n* [[Monica Evans]] as [[Maid Marian]], a [[fox|vixen]], niece of King Richard and the primary [[love interest]] of Robin Hood.\n* [[Phil Harris]] as [[Little John]], Robin Hood's best friend, who is very gluttonous and though not small at all still called \"Little John\". Portrayed as a [[bear]], he is a recreation of ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''{{'}}s [[Baloo]], as both characters are voiced by Phil Harris and were animated by the same Disney animators.\n* [[Roger Miller]] as [[Alan-a-Dale]], a [[rooster]] who serves as the [[narrator]] of the film.\n* [[Andy Devine]] as [[Friar Tuck]], the town's local [[friar]] who protects the villagers of [[Nottingham]]. Portrayed as a [[badger]], he is taken to be hanged at the end of the film in a plot of Prince John's to lure Robin Hood out of hiding, but is rescued in time.\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[John, King of England#Depictions in fiction|Prince John]] and [[Richard I of England|King Richard]], respectively a greedy [[fraud]] and the true king of England. Both characters are [[lion]]s. Prince John has the habit of sucking his thumb when someone mentions his [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|mother]]. At the end of the film, King Richard returns from the [[Third Crusade]] and sentences his brother Prince John to work in the Royal Rock Pile.\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Sir Hiss, Prince John's [[snake]] friend who is tricky and hypocritical. He is similar to ''The Jungle Book'''s [[Kaa]].\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Lady Kluck, a [[chicken]] who is good friends with Maid Marian.\n* [[Pat Buttram]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], a greedy and shifty [[wolf]].\n* [[George Lindsey]] and [[Ken Curtis]] as Trigger and Nutsy, respectively, [[vulture]] guardsmen.\n* [[John Fiedler]] and [[Barbara Luddy]] as Friar Tuck's [[Sexton (office)|Sexton]] and his wife, respectively, church [[mouse|mice]]. Luddy also voiced Mother Rabbit, the mother of Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong.\n* Billy Whitaker, Dana Laurita, Dori Whitaker, and Richie Sanders as Skippy, Sis, Tagalong, and Toby, respectively, the local children of Nottingham who idolize Robin Hood. Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong are [[rabbit]]s while Toby is a [[turtle]].\n* [[Candy Candido]] as the Captain of the Guard, a [[crocodile]] who hosts the archery tournament.\n* [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Otto, a [[dog]] blacksmith with a lame leg.\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box|width =33%|quote=\"As director of story and character concepts, I knew right off that sly Robin Hood must be a fox. From there it was logical that Maid Marian should be a pretty vixen. Little John, legendarily known for his size, was easily a big overgrown bear.\n\nFriar Tuck is great as a badger, but he was also great as a pig, as I had originally planned. Then I thought the symbol of a pig might be offensive to the [[Catholic Church|Church]], so we changed him. Richard the Lion-hearted, of course, had to be a regal, proud, strong lion; and his pathetic cousin [historically, and in the movie, his brother] Prince John, the weak villain, also had to be a lion, but we made him scrawny and childish.

Over the years, the studio decided to make Reynard the villain of a musical feature film named ''Chanticleer and Reynard'' (based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Chantecler (play)|Chanticleer]]''), but the production was scrapped in the early 1960s in favor of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}}\n\nWhile ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970) was in production, [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] began exploring possibilities for the next film.

American [[Animation|animated]] [[romance film|romantic]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. Produced and directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it is the 21st [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. The story follows the adventures of [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]], [[Little John]], and the inhabitants of [[Nottingham]] as they fight against the excessive taxation of [[John, King of England|Prince John]], and Robin Hood wins the hand of [[Maid Marian]]. The film features the voices of [[Brian Bedford]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Peter Ustinov]], [[Pat Buttram]], [[Monica Evans]], and [[Carole Shelley]]. \n\nThe idea to adapt ''Robin Hood'' into an animated feature dated back to [[Walt Disney]]'s interest in the tale of [[Reynard|Reynard the Fox]] during his first full-length feature production, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). The idea was repeatedly shelved until writer and production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] incorporated ideas from it in a pitch of the legend of [[Robin Hood]] using [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals rather than people during the production of ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970).\n\n''Robin Hood'' was released on November 8, 1973 to box office success. It was initially received positively by film critics who praised the voice cast, animation, and humor yet its critical reception became gradually mixed since its release. The film has also gained a fan following.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 561 words. -->\nThe film is narrated by the [[rooster]] [[Alan-a-Dale]], who explains that [[Robin Hood]] and [[Little John]] live in [[Sherwood Forest]], robbing from the rich and giving to the poor townsfolk of [[Nottingham]]. Meanwhile, [[John, King of England|Prince John]], who is king of England, sends his lead henchman, the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], to catch the two but he fails every time. Meanwhile, Prince John and his assistant Sir Hiss, arrive in Nottingham. Sir Hiss hypnotized Prince John's brother [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] to go off on the [[Crusades]], allowing Prince John to take the throne. Unfortunately, the prince is greedy and immature, even sucking his thumb whenever his [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|mother]] is mentioned. Robin and Little John rob Prince John by disguising themselves as fortune tellers, prompting the prince to put a bounty on their heads and makes the Sheriff his personal tax collector.\n\nThe Sheriff taxes [[Friar Tuck]] and a family of rabbits. However, Robin gives back some money to the rabbits, giving his hat and archery kit to the young rabbit Skippy for his birthday. Skippy and his friends test out the archery kit, but Skippy fires an arrow into the grounds of [[Maid Marian]]'s castle. The children sneak inside, meeting Maid Marian and her attendant Lady Kluck. Maid Marian reveals she and Robin were childhood sweethearts but they have not seen one another for years. Friar Tuck visits Robin and Little John, explaining that Prince John is hosting an archery tournament, and the winner will receive a kiss from Maid Marian. Robin agrees to participate in the tournament disguised as a [[stork]] whilst Little John disguises himself as the Duke of Chutney to get near Prince John. Sir Hiss discovers Robin's identity but is trapped in a barrel of ale by Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale. Robin wins the tournament, but Prince John exposes him and has him arrested for execution despite Maid Marian's pleas.\n\nLittle John threatens Prince John leading to a fight between Robin, Little John, Maid Marian, Lady Kluck and Prince John's soldiers. In the forest, Robin and Maid Marian fall in love again as the townsfolk sing a song mocking Prince John, describing him as the \"Phony King of England\". Enraged by the song, Prince John triples the taxes, imprisoning most of the townsfolk who cannot or refuse to pay their taxes. The Sheriff visits Friar Tuck's church to steal from the poor box, enraging Friar Tuck who viciously attacks him until he too is arrested. Prince John plans to hang Friar Tuck to lure in Robin and kill him. Robin and Little John sneak in, with Little John managing to free all of the prisoners whilst Robin steals Prince John's taxes, but Sir Hiss awakens to find Robin fleeing.\n\nChaos follows as Robin and the others try to escape to Sherwood Forest. The Sheriff corners Robin after he is forced to return to rescue Skippy's younger sister, setting fire to Prince John's castle and causing Robin to leap from a tower into the moat below. Little John and Skippy watch as the moat is pelted with arrows and Robin is apparently shot and drowned, only for him to emerge unharmed after using a reed as a breathing tube. Prince John despairs and is driven into a blind rage when Sir Hiss points out his mother's castle is on fire. Later, King Richard returns to England, placing his brother and his cohorts under arrest and allows Robin and Maid Marian to be married and leave Nottingham with Little John and Skippy in tow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brian Bedford]] as [[Robin Hood (Disney character)|Robin Hood]], a gifted archer who is seen doing good for the townspeople. He is portrayed as a [[fox]].\n* [[Monica Evans]] as [[Maid Marian]], a [[fox|vixen]], niece of King Richard and the primary [[love interest]] of Robin Hood.\n* [[Phil Harris]] as [[Little John]], Robin Hood's best friend, who is very gluttonous and though not small at all still called \"Little John\". Portrayed as a [[bear]], he is a recreation of ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''{{'}}s [[Baloo]], as both characters are voiced by Phil Harris and were animated by the same Disney animators.\n* [[Roger Miller]] as [[Alan-a-Dale]], a [[rooster]] who serves as the [[narrator]] of the film.\n* [[Andy Devine]] as [[Friar Tuck]], the town's local [[friar]] who protects the villagers of [[Nottingham]]. Portrayed as a [[badger]], he is taken to be hanged at the end of the film in a plot of Prince John's to lure Robin Hood out of hiding, but is rescued in time.\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[John, King of England#Depictions in fiction|Prince John]] and [[Richard I of England|King Richard]], respectively a greedy [[fraud]] and the true king of England. Both characters are [[lion]]s. Prince John has the habit of sucking his thumb when someone mentions his [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|mother]]. At the end of the film, King Richard returns from the [[Third Crusade]] and sentences his brother Prince John to work in the Royal Rock Pile.\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Sir Hiss, Prince John's [[snake]] friend who is tricky and hypocritical. He is similar to ''The Jungle Book'''s [[Kaa]].\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Lady Kluck, a [[chicken]] who is good friends with Maid Marian.\n* [[Pat Buttram]] as the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], a greedy and shifty [[wolf]].\n* [[George Lindsey]] and [[Ken Curtis]] as Trigger and Nutsy, respectively, [[vulture]] guardsmen.\n* [[John Fiedler]] and [[Barbara Luddy]] as Friar Tuck's [[Sexton (office)|Sexton]] and his wife, respectively, church [[mouse|mice]]. Luddy also voiced Mother Rabbit, the mother of Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong.\n* Billy Whitaker, Dana Laurita, Dori Whitaker, and Richie Sanders as Skippy, Sis, Tagalong, and Toby, respectively, the local children of Nottingham who idolize Robin Hood. Skippy, Sis, and Tagalong are [[rabbit]]s while Toby is a [[turtle]].\n* [[Candy Candido]] as the Captain of the Guard, a [[crocodile]] who hosts the archery tournament.\n* [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Otto, a [[dog]] blacksmith with a lame leg.\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box|width =33%|quote=\"As director of story and character concepts, I knew right off that sly Robin Hood must be a fox. From there it was logical that Maid Marian should be a pretty vixen. Little John, legendarily known for his size, was easily a big overgrown bear.\n\nFriar Tuck is great as a badger, but he was also great as a pig, as I had originally planned. Then I thought the symbol of a pig might be offensive to the [[Catholic Church|Church]], so we changed him. Richard the Lion-hearted, of course, had to be a regal, proud, strong lion; and his pathetic cousin [historically, and in the movie, his brother] Prince John, the weak villain, also had to be a lion, but we made him scrawny and childish. I originally thought of a snake as a member of the poor townspeople but one of the other men here suggested that a snake would be perfect as a slithering consort [Sir Hiss] to mean Prince John.\"|source=Ken Anderson{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}}}}\n\nAround the time of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937, [[Walt Disney]] became interested in adapting the twelfth-century legend of [[Reynard]] the Fox.{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}} However, the project languished due to Walt's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harty|first=Kevin|date=2012|chapter=Walt in Sherwood, or the Sheriff of Disneyland: Disney and the film legend of Robin Hood.|title=The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past|series=The New Middle Ages|edition=2012|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0230340077|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljMmuV2VUXwC&lpg=PA134&dq=%22robin%20hood%22%20disney&pg=PA133}} eds.

Over the years, the studio decided to make Reynard the villain of a musical feature film named ''Chanticleer and Reynard'' (based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[Chantecler (play)|Chanticleer]]''), but the production was scrapped in the early 1960s in favor of ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (1963).{{sfn|Grant|1998|p=290}}\n\nWhile ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970) was in production, [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] began exploring possibilities for the next film.
