Weedon's action sequences, and the overall look of the film, were inspired by [[samurai films]].

There the earl Durant ([[Karel Roden]]) rules as a [[despotism|despot]] with his equally cruel sons Lord Artus (Gianna Giardinelli) and Lord Romain ([[Edward Akrout]]).\n\nShadow Walker makes common cause with and rallies a large band of exiled rebel [[Anglo-Saxon]] farmers led by Anna ([[Annabelle Wallis]]). \nDurant is his treacherous uncle, who murdered his own brother and [[usurpation|usurped]] the power of the earldom, his nephew's [[hereditary title|birthright]].

Whereas the samurai films with their shorter swords lent themselves to... much faster and action orientated aspects in any given fight sequence... I was constantly looking for quick kills, sword slices that were hard and fast for the visual impact and to give us the energy and excitement of the battles as the heroes cut through cipher after cipher.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Production==\n''Sword of Vengeance'' was produced by [[Vertigo Films]] and Red Production, \"which has a long tradition of cooperation with foreign productions\".<ref name=\"FiS2\">{{cite web |title=Filming of the movie Sword of Vengeance completed today in Serbia |url=http://www.filminserbia.com/news/filming-of-the-movie-sword-of-vengeance-completed-today-in-serbia-2/ |website=Film in Serbia |publisher=Film in Serbia Commission |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Vertigo producer Huberta Von Liel noted that except for a few leading actors, the director, and the director of photography, everyone else involved, about 150 cast and crew, were from [[Serbia]].<ref name=\"FiS2\" />\n\n===Background===\nJim Weedon began his career as a film editor, and was encouraged to try directing by [[Ridley Scott]].<ref name=\"Sitges\">{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/film?id=10003528 |website=[[Sitges Film Festival]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> While ''Sword of Vengeance'' was his first feature film, this was \"after cutting his teeth editing music videos and television commercials.\"<ref name=\"Scheck\" /> He had won awards for his previous work.<ref name=\"Hunter\">{{cite web |last1=Hunter |first1=Allan |title=Sword Of Vengeance |url=https://www.screendaily.com/sword-of-vengeance/5078750.article |website=[[Screen Daily]] |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=17 October 2014}}</ref> Weedon was approached by Von Liel, who asked if he would be interested in making a period [[revenge]] drama: \"I was incredibly interested in the opportunity but also the fact that Vertigo Films allowed me total creative control visually.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n===Writing and characterisation===\nWhen Julian Unthank joined the project to develop the script, he and Weedon \"stripped back the dialogue to a minimum, something that was used a fair amount in the Spaghetti Westerns.\"<blockquote>We didn't want the film to fall into the standard cinematic tropes, although the script is a basic premise of revenge we wanted the story to unfold in more unexpected prose, especially the ending. I also wanted our hero to be an antihero, rather than the man that saves the day. His character although conflicted tries to atone for his sins but it comes too late, however, his absolution from Anna in the final scene allows him to find peace and solace from his chosen path of revenge.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Design===\nAesthetically, Weedon went for what he called a \"bleach bypass approach\" to [[colour grading|grading]] \"to achieve very little colour in the film.\" Wardrobe was designed to be \"muted,\" working with blues, greys and black; \"the only real colour coming through is the inherent hues from the fur that the heroes wore.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The film's already low colour palette was accentuated by [[principal photography]] taking place in winter, as Jennie Kermode notes; everything appears dark, the sky a \"miserable grey,\" and the land \"hard and unyielding.\"<ref name=\"Kermode\">{{cite web |last1=Kermode |first1=Jennie |url=https://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/sword-of-vengeance-2015-film-review-by-jennie-kermode |title=''Sword Of Vengeance'' |website=eyeforfilm.co.uk |publisher=Eye For Film (UK) |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Weedon said he wanted the film to \"look and smell of the dark ages.\"<blockquote>Every aspect of the film from locations to clothing had to look worn, beaten and broken. I had shot some commercials in Serbia and found that they had very talented crew in all departments. Milos Djukelic had just co-produced ''Ironclad 2'' so was ahead in terms of the requirements we needed to create this harsh and foreboding world.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Filming and editing===\nLocation scouting took place in July 2013.<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> ''Sword of Vengeance'' was filmed in thirty days in four locations in [[Serbia]].<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> These were the forest of Boj\u010dinska \u0160uma,<ref name=\"FiS\" /> in the [[Progar]] area of [[Belgrade]], as well as the fortress in [[Kalemegdan]], [[Deliblato]] and Pancevo Reva.<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> Weedon said he lost half a [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (seven [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]) the first four weeks into the shooting schedule, which was five to six days a week, in harsh weather, wading through mud every day, and later it snowed: \"days and nights were spent knee deep in mud that at dawn was dangerously frozen ice and by mid morning a muddy mass that was equally harsh.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> However, the most difficult part was actually the first two days:<blockquote>Ridiculously we decided to shoot the opening sequence which involved rain fx, horses, stunts, and prosthetics. It was the crew's first two days together, suddenly we are in the rain with actors who can't ride, horses that won't stand still, actors who are going into hyperthermia, and prosthetic limbs that refuse to come apart properly, add in stunts that could only be repeated three to four times, blood that wouldn't squirt sufficiently and the opening crane move into scene that kept breaking down. I did ask myself how the hell did I get into this mess.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\nWeedon described the editing of the film with Tom Boulding as \"incredibly fast\".<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n===Sound and music===\nWith so little dialogue in the film, it fell to the [[sound design]]er, Roland Heap, and the composer, [[Stephen Hilton]], to \"convey the unsaid.\" Weedon wanted the audience to have a \"musical roller-coaster ride\": \"Sound is integral to my commercial work and something that always creates the unexpected in the visuals.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe world premiere of ''Sword of Vengeance'' took place at the [[Sitges Film Festival]], where it was in competition, on 10 October 2014.<ref name=\"Sitges\" /> It had its Serbian premiere on 5 March 2015 at the [[FEST (Belgrade)|Belgrade International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' |url=http://2015.fest.rs/Movies/1983/Sword-of-Vengeance.shtml |website=2015.fest.rs |publisher=FEST 43rd International Film Festival |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> The British theatrical release did not follow until 29 May.<ref name=\"IMDb\" />\n\n===Home media and streaming===\n''Sword of Vengeance'' has been available on DVD and DVD/Blu-ray (Well Go USA Entertainment,<ref name=\"RT\" /> [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword Of Vengeance [Blu-ray + DVD] |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Sword-Vengeance-Blu-ray-Stanley-Webber/dp/B00V72RPLM |website=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> and streaming services ([[Google Play]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Sword_of_Vengeance?gl=no&hl=en&id=TXDQtbnE8ng |website=[[Google Play]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> [[iTunes]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://itunes.apple.com/jo/movie/sword-of-vengeance/id1005046805 |website=[[iTunes]] |publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]] |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> [[Hulu]])<ref>{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Brett |title=What\u2019s Streaming on Netflix Tonight: \u2018Acts of Vengeance\u2019 + More |url=https://decider.com/2018/01/25/new-on-netflix-acts-of-vengeance/ |website=Decider |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> since May 2015.\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:Stanley Weber 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Stanley Weber]] in 2018]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] assigns ''Sword of Vengeance'' a rating of 13% based on eight reviews.<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite web |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sword_of_vengeance |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Critics gave faint to fair praise to the fight scenes, and to [[Stanley Weber]]'s performance, but found the film wanting otherwise, though acknowledging at the same time that the fighting sequences would be enjoyed by action film fans.\n\nAllan Hunter's review following the world premiere at Sitges set the tone for critics into 2015:<blockquote>The only things that appear to be lacking is an original story and some decent dialogue... Stanley Weber's Shadow Walker is very much in the Eastwood tradition down to the squint in his eye and the poncho-like garment draped over his strapping shoulders. He is a man with no name but a remarkably good hair stylist to maintain those immaculate cornrows... The plot is pretty basic but served up with some style by Weedon... His vision of England is bleak, oppressive and uniformly monochrome.  It sometimes seems as if the only colour in the palette of cinematographer August Jakobsson is the crimson of fresh blood. There is a good deal of blood though as limbs are hacked off, throats are slit and eyes plucked out with merry abandon.  Weedon keeps it tight and spare but the real drawbacks are the weary plotting and cheesy dialogue.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /></blockquote>\n\nFrank Scheck, writing for the ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', opines that the title \"pretty much says it all\": there are \"enough clanging sword fights, severed limbs, slit throats and bare-bones dialogue to satisfy genre fans while pretty much failing to provide something of interest to anyone else\"; the film, while \"admirably stylish\", has the feel of an 11th century-set [[video game]].

I also wanted our hero to be an antihero, rather than the man that saves the day. His character although conflicted tries to atone for his sins but it comes too late, however, his absolution from Anna in the final scene allows him to find peace and solace from his chosen path of revenge.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Design===\nAesthetically, Weedon went for what he called a \"bleach bypass approach\" to [[colour grading|grading]] \"to achieve very little colour in the film.\" Wardrobe was designed to be \"muted,\" working with blues, greys and black; \"the only real colour coming through is the inherent hues from the fur that the heroes wore.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The film's already low colour palette was accentuated by [[principal photography]] taking place in winter, as Jennie Kermode notes; everything appears dark, the sky a \"miserable grey,\" and the land \"hard and unyielding.\"<ref name=\"Kermode\">{{cite web |last1=Kermode |first1=Jennie |url=https://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/sword-of-vengeance-2015-film-review-by-jennie-kermode |title=''Sword Of Vengeance'' |website=eyeforfilm.co.uk |publisher=Eye For Film (UK) |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Weedon said he wanted the film to \"look and smell of the dark ages.\"<blockquote>Every aspect of the film from locations to clothing had to look worn, beaten and broken. I had shot some commercials in Serbia and found that they had very talented crew in all departments. Milos Djukelic had just co-produced ''Ironclad 2'' so was ahead in terms of the requirements we needed to create this harsh and foreboding world.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Filming and editing===\nLocation scouting took place in July 2013.<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> ''Sword of Vengeance'' was filmed in thirty days in four locations in [[Serbia]].<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> These were the forest of Boj\u010dinska \u0160uma,<ref name=\"FiS\" /> in the [[Progar]] area of [[Belgrade]], as well as the fortress in [[Kalemegdan]], [[Deliblato]] and Pancevo Reva.<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> Weedon said he lost half a [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (seven [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]) the first four weeks into the shooting schedule, which was five to six days a week, in harsh weather, wading through mud every day, and later it snowed: \"days and nights were spent knee deep in mud that at dawn was dangerously frozen ice and by mid morning a muddy mass that was equally harsh.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> However, the most difficult part was actually the first two days:<blockquote>Ridiculously we decided to shoot the opening sequence which involved rain fx, horses, stunts, and prosthetics. It was the crew's first two days together, suddenly we are in the rain with actors who can't ride, horses that won't stand still, actors who are going into hyperthermia, and prosthetic limbs that refuse to come apart properly, add in stunts that could only be repeated three to four times, blood that wouldn't squirt sufficiently and the opening crane move into scene that kept breaking down.

Stanley Weber's Shadow Walker is very much in the Eastwood tradition down to the squint in his eye and the poncho-like garment draped over his strapping shoulders. He is a man with no name but a remarkably good hair stylist to maintain those immaculate cornrows... The plot is pretty basic but served up with some style by Weedon... His vision of England is bleak, oppressive and uniformly monochrome.  It sometimes seems as if the only colour in the palette of cinematographer August Jakobsson is the crimson of fresh blood. There is a good deal of blood though as limbs are hacked off, throats are slit and eyes plucked out with merry abandon.  Weedon keeps it tight and spare but the real drawbacks are the weary plotting and cheesy dialogue.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /></blockquote>\n\nFrank Scheck, writing for the ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', opines that the title \"pretty much says it all\": there are \"enough clanging sword fights, severed limbs, slit throats and bare-bones dialogue to satisfy genre fans while pretty much failing to provide something of interest to anyone else\"; the film, while \"admirably stylish\", has the feel of an 11th century-set [[video game]]. Stanley Weber stands out among the cast, \"even managing to make such declarations as \"Vengeance is my only belief\" sound convincing.\"<ref name=\"Scheck\" /> Josh Oakley complains that the dialogue is \"overwrought and bland, with the actors apparently instructed to take long pauses between each line\" and \"much of the cast\" seem to have accents like [[Tommy Wiseau]]'s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oakley |first1=Josh |title=\"It is he who brings them hope.\" |url=http://cutprintfilm.com/reviews/sword-of-vengeance/ |website=CutPrintFilm |accessdate=21 October 2019 |date=17 March 2015}}</ref> Ernest Hardy of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said the fillm \"hits its mark of being a popcorn action flick just fine.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sword-of-vengeance |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nJames Luxford of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' said there is a \"brutal simplicity to the action that will appeal to some,\" but otherwise, ''Sword of Vengeance'' \"seems stretched even for a relatively short film.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luxford |first1=James |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' |journal=[[Radio Times]] |date=May 28, 2015 |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/dhgf5q/sword-of-vengeance/ |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Jennie Kermode assigned the film 2 stars out of 5, saying the fight scenes were uneven but: \"Weber's work is carefully choreographed and will please fans of fighting films even if it does sometimes take liberties with physics.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence. The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations: the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for the five [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible.

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together. Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours. A wide range of versions of these exist, either perforated or imperforate, on unwatermarked or watermarked paper, and with or without a [[Specimen stamp|specimen overprint]].

It is believed that only two sheets of the error were printed, and they were allegedly acquired on the first day of issue by Alfredo Caruana Gatto, a [[Maltese Political Union]] politician who was a member of the Senate and who had been Minister for Justice in 1921\u201322. The exact circumstances of their issue remain unclear, and it is not known whether they were acquired over the Post Office counter or not. Caruana Gatto is said to have immediately sold the two sheets to Carol Saliba and Pio Grech, and the sheets were eventually broken down and sold to stamp dealers and collectors. A small amount of the error stamps were used on mail by philatelists, but the vast majority were retained in [[Mint stamp|mint condition]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nIn 1930, uncertainty about the stamp's issue formed the basis of a political campaign by the [[Constitutional Party (Malta)|Constitutional Party]] against the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] which became known as the \"Postage Stamps Scandal\". The matter was brought up in the Legislative Assembly on 31 March 1930 when Constitutional Party member Alfred Gera De Petri asked Robert Hamilton, the Minister for Posts, about the circumstances of the stamp's issue. A committee was later appointed to investigate the matter, and it included [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Gerald Strickland]], Hamilton, Walter Salomone, [[Paul Boffa]] and [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nThe committee members belonging to the Constitutional Party produced a report in which they stated that there was no evidence that the error was ever sold at a Post Office or that Caruana Gatto (who had died in 1926) had sold the stamps. They concluded that the inverted overprint was applied at the Government Printing Office without authorisation to sheets of genuine stamps which were not part of the Post Office stock, meaning that the overprints were forged. Boffa mentioned that the overprinting might have even been done outside the Government Printing Office, while Mifsud only agreed with the conclusion that there was no evidence of Caruana Gatto's involvement in the matter. There were gaps in the evidence collected by the committee, and it did not produce any arguments which countered various opinions that the overprints were the result of a genuine mistake, making its findings inconclusive.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence.

There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]].

Despite this, some stamps with errors still ended up in circulation, including the 3d value with the overprint inverted, and various denominations with the overprints misplaced to varying degrees, the most notable being a variety of the 4d in which the overprint reads \"AGE POST\".<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\n===3d with inverted overprint===\n[[File:Malta 1926 Melita Postage 3d black on yellow overprint inverted.jpg|thumb|The 3d with the \"POSTAGE\" overprint inverted]]\n\nThe 3d black on yellow is known with the [[Invert error|overprint inverted]], and it is one of Malta's best-known error stamps. It is believed that only two sheets of the error were printed, and they were allegedly acquired on the first day of issue by Alfredo Caruana Gatto, a [[Maltese Political Union]] politician who was a member of the Senate and who had been Minister for Justice in 1921\u201322. The exact circumstances of their issue remain unclear, and it is not known whether they were acquired over the Post Office counter or not. Caruana Gatto is said to have immediately sold the two sheets to Carol Saliba and Pio Grech, and the sheets were eventually broken down and sold to stamp dealers and collectors. A small amount of the error stamps were used on mail by philatelists, but the vast majority were retained in [[Mint stamp|mint condition]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nIn 1930, uncertainty about the stamp's issue formed the basis of a political campaign by the [[Constitutional Party (Malta)|Constitutional Party]] against the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] which became known as the \"Postage Stamps Scandal\". The matter was brought up in the Legislative Assembly on 31 March 1930 when Constitutional Party member Alfred Gera De Petri asked Robert Hamilton, the Minister for Posts, about the circumstances of the stamp's issue. A committee was later appointed to investigate the matter, and it included [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Gerald Strickland]], Hamilton, Walter Salomone, [[Paul Boffa]] and [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nThe committee members belonging to the Constitutional Party produced a report in which they stated that there was no evidence that the error was ever sold at a Post Office or that Caruana Gatto (who had died in 1926) had sold the stamps. They concluded that the inverted overprint was applied at the Government Printing Office without authorisation to sheets of genuine stamps which were not part of the Post Office stock, meaning that the overprints were forged. Boffa mentioned that the overprinting might have even been done outside the Government Printing Office, while Mifsud only agreed with the conclusion that there was no evidence of Caruana Gatto's involvement in the matter. There were gaps in the evidence collected by the committee, and it did not produce any arguments which countered various opinions that the overprints were the result of a genuine mistake, making its findings inconclusive.

The design by [[Emvin Cremona]] depicts Melita holding a spear and a shield with Malta's 1943\u201364 coat of arms (including the [[George Cross]]), and she is shown sitting among ruins as if after a battle.<ref name=\"sg\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casingena |first1=Mario |title=Melita |journal=The Melite Post |date=March 2018 |issue=6 |pages=3\u20134 |url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/32002/1/The%20Melite%20Post%20-%20Issue%206.pdf |publisher=\u017bejtun Philatelic Society |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418135622/https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/32002/1/The%20Melite%20Post%20-%20Issue%206.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn allegorical figure with a pose similar to Caruana Dingli's Melita design was used on the fifth and final series of [[Maltese lira]] banknotes. These banknotes were introduced by the [[Central Bank of Malta]] on 18 September 1989, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of independence, and they had four denominations: Lm2, Lm5, Lm10 and Lm20. Another series of banknotes with the same design but with amended security features was issued on 1 June 1994. Versions with signatures of different Governors of the Central Bank were issued in 1997, 1999 and 2001, and there was also a special issue for collectors in 2000.<ref>{{cite book |title=Said Malta Coin & Banknote Catalogue 2010 |date=2010 |publisher=Said International Ltd |pages=180\u2013193}}</ref> These banknotes remained in use until Malta adopted the [[euro]] on 1 January 2008, and remained legal tender until 31 January 2008; they were demonetized ten years later on 31 January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maltese banknotes \u2013 5th Series and enhanced version (not legal tender after 31 January 2008)|url=http://www.centralbankmalta.org/site/currency2e.html|publisher=[[Central Bank of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227162525/http://www.centralbankmalta.org/site/currency2e.html|archivedate=27 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Timeline Banknotes |url=https://www.centralbankmalta.org/timeline-banknotes |website=[[Central Bank of Malta]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122163451/https://www.centralbankmalta.org/timeline-banknotes |archivedate=22 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 2011, MaltaPost issued a [[miniature sheet]] containing a \u20ac4.16 stamp to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the establishment of Malta's [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]].

The term is borrowed from [[Rugby football|rugby]], where a scrum is a formation of players.

Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346\u2013351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges\u2014for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. \n\nAs such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] \u2013 accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".\n\nThe authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)\n\nThe Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKen and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum.

Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. The Product Owner uses Scrum\u2019s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.\n\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>\n\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n* Define and announce releases.\n* Communicate delivery and team status.\n* Share progress during governance meetings.\n* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\n* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\n* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\n\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>\n\nA product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.\n\n=== Development team ===\n\nThe development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. \n\nThe team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scrum master ===\n\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O\u2019Connor, M. and Edison, H.

The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed. The scrum master helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes in the Scrum framework, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve. The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator<ref>Leybourn, E. (2013). ''Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management''.

The sprint is a [[timeboxing|timeboxed]] effort; that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nEach sprint starts with a ''sprint planning'' event that establishes a sprint goal and the required product backlog items. The team accepts what they agree is ready and translate this into a sprint backlog, with a breakdown of the work required and an estimated forecast for the sprint goal. Each sprint ends with a ''sprint review'' and ''sprint retrospective'', that reviews progress to show to stakeholders and identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> \n\nScrum emphasizes valuable, useful output at the end of the sprint that is really done. In the case of software, this likely includes that the software has been fully integrated, tested and documented, and is potentially releasable.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" />\n\n=== Sprint planning ===\n\nAt the beginning of a sprint, the scrum team holds a sprint planning event<ref name=\"Sprint 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.neonrain.com/agile-scrum-web-development|title=Agile SCRUM For Denver Web Development|last=Gangji|first=Arif|last2=Hartman|first2=Bob|year=2015|website=|publisher=Neon Rain Interactive|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref> to:\n\n* Mutually discuss and agree on the scope of work that is intended to be done during that sprint\n* Select product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint\n* Prepare a sprint backlog that includes the work needed to complete the selected product backlog items\n* Agree the '''sprint goal,''' a short description of what they are forecasting to deliver at the end of the sprint.\n*The recommended duration is four hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations) <ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n** During the first half, the whole scrum team (development team, scrum master, and product owner) selects the product backlog items they believe could be completed in that sprint\n** During the second half, the development team identifies the detailed work (tasks) required to complete those product backlog items; resulting in a confirmed sprint backlog\n*** As the detailed work is elaborated, some product backlog items may be split or put back into the product backlog if the team no longer believes they can complete the required work in a single sprint\n* Once the development team has prepared their sprint backlog, they forecast (usually by voting) which tasks will be delivered within the sprint.\n\n=== Daily scrum ===\n\n[[File:Daily sprint meeting.jpg|thumb|A daily scrum in the computing room.

What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?\n* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))\n* This event is facilitated by the scrum master\n\n=== Backlog refinement ===\n\nBacklog [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]] (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.\n\nAlthough not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416\u2013421}}</ref>\n\nThe backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n\n=== Cancelling a sprint ===\n\nThe product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\n\n== Artifacts ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Product backlog ===\n\nThe product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=P\u00e9raire|first3=C\u00e9cile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.\u2014whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.\n\nThe product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.\n\nThe product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it\n\nStory points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.\n\nEvery team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.\n\nThe product backlog:\n\n* Captures requests to modify a product\u2014including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues\n* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner\n\nTypically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.\n\n==== Management ====\n\nA product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nAs the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment\u2014the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''.

The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.\n\nThe product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.\n\nThe sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.\n\nOnce a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.\n\n=== Increment ===\n\nThe ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n==== Sprint burndown chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]\n\n{{main|Burn down chart}}\n\nThe sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G.

Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.\n\nThe release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.\n\n==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====\nThe start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].\n\n==== Definition of done (DoD) ====\nThe [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>\n\n==== Velocity ====\n\nThe total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.\n\n==== Spike ====\n\nA time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>\n\n==== Tracer bullet ====\n\nAlso called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43\u201346 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C.

This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.\n* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.\n* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.\n\n== Tools for implementation ==\n{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}\nLike other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.\n\nMany companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum\u2014which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.\n\nOther organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools.

All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178\u2013179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>\n\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].\n# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\n# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\n# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVarious authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.  Many refer to these methodological techniques as 'patterns' - by analogy with [[design pattern]]s in architecture and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/scrumorgpatterns.com/www/|title=Scrum as Organizational Patterns |last=Bj\u00f8rnvig|first=Gertrud|last2=Coplien|first2=Jim|date=June 21, 2008|website=|publisher=Gertrude & Cope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumplop.org|title=Scrum Pattern Community |website=ScrumPLoP.org|access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Such patterns have extended Scrum outside of the software development domain into Manufacturing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agilebusinessmanagement.org/content/wikispeed-%E2%80%93-applying-agile-software-principles-and-practices-fast-automotive-development|title=WIKISPEED \u2013 Applying Agile software principles and practices for fast automotive development|date=December 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Agile Business Management Consortium |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Finance and [[Human Resources]].\n\n=== Scrumban ===\n{{Main|Scrumban}}\n\nScrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.\n\nThe major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />\n\n=== Scrum of scrums ===\n[[File:Scrum of Scrums.png|thumb|right|Scrum of Scrums<ref>https://www.erudicat.com/pmp-blog/scrum-of-scrums-sos</ref>]]\n\nThe scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management \u2013 How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\nThis should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?\n* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?\n* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?\n\nAs [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\n<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>\n\n===Large-scale Scrum===\nLarge-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.\n\nThere are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works. In 2013, the experiments were solidified into the LeSS framework rules.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014 |title=Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)|url=http://less.works}}</ref> The intention of LeSS is to 'descale' organization complexity, dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solutions, and solving them in simpler ways.

Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346\u2013351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges\u2014for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. \n\nAs such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] \u2013 accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".\n\nThe authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)\n\nThe Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.\n\nIn the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKen and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum.

The Product Owner uses Scrum\u2019s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.\n\nCommunication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>\n\nAs the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n* Define and announce releases.\n* Communicate delivery and team status.\n* Share progress during governance meetings.\n* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.\n* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.\n* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.\n\nEmpathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have\u2014the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>\n\nA product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.\n\n=== Development team ===\n\nThe development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. \n\nThe team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scrum master ===\n\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O\u2019Connor, M. and Edison, H.

The sprint is a [[timeboxing|timeboxed]] effort; that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nEach sprint starts with a ''sprint planning'' event that establishes a sprint goal and the required product backlog items. The team accepts what they agree is ready and translate this into a sprint backlog, with a breakdown of the work required and an estimated forecast for the sprint goal. Each sprint ends with a ''sprint review'' and ''sprint retrospective'', that reviews progress to show to stakeholders and identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> \n\nScrum emphasizes valuable, useful output at the end of the sprint that is really done.

What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?\n* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))\n* This event is facilitated by the scrum master\n\n=== Backlog refinement ===\n\nBacklog [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]] (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.\n\nAlthough not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416\u2013421}}</ref>\n\nThe backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n\n=== Cancelling a sprint ===\n\nThe product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\n\n== Artifacts ==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Product backlog ===\n\nThe product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=P\u00e9raire|first3=C\u00e9cile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.\u2014whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.\n\nThe product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.\n\nThe product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it\n\nStory points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.\n\nEvery team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.\n\nThe product backlog:\n\n* Captures requests to modify a product\u2014including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues\n* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner\n\nTypically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.\n\n==== Management ====\n\nA product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />\n\nAs the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment\u2014the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''.

Milosevic|title=Project Management ToolBox: Tools and Techniques for the Practicing Project Manager|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbA7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA304|date=January 5, 2016|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-97320-2|page=304}}</ref> The list is derived by the scrum team progressively selecting product backlog items in priority order from the top of the product backlog until they feel they have enough work to fill the sprint. The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.\n\nThe product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.\n\nThe sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.\n\nOnce a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.\n\n=== Increment ===\n\nThe ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.\n\n=== Extensions ===\n\nThe following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n==== Sprint burndown chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]\n\n{{main|Burn down chart}}\n\nThe sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).\n\nDuring sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.\n\nIt should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].\n\n==== Release burn-up chart ====\n\n[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]\n\nThe release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.\n\nThe release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.\n\n==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====\nThe start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].\n\n==== Definition of done (DoD) ====\nThe [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>\n\n==== Velocity ====\n\nThe total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.\n\n==== Spike ====\n\nA time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>\n\n==== Tracer bullet ====\n\nAlso called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43\u201346 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C.

This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.\n* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.\n* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.\n\n== Tools for implementation ==\n{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}\nLike other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.\n\nMany companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum\u2014which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.\n\nOther organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly|last=Dubakov|first=Michael|year=2008|accessdate=August 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Scrum values ==\n\nScrum is a feedback-driven empirical approach which is, like all empirical process control, underpinned by the three pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178\u2013179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>\n\nThese three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />\n\n# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].\n# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.\n# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.\n# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.\n# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVarious authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.  Many refer to these methodological techniques as 'patterns' - by analogy with [[design pattern]]s in architecture and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/scrumorgpatterns.com/www/|title=Scrum as Organizational Patterns |last=Bj\u00f8rnvig|first=Gertrud|last2=Coplien|first2=Jim|date=June 21, 2008|website=|publisher=Gertrude & Cope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumplop.org|title=Scrum Pattern Community |website=ScrumPLoP.org|access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Such patterns have extended Scrum outside of the software development domain into Manufacturing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agilebusinessmanagement.org/content/wikispeed-%E2%80%93-applying-agile-software-principles-and-practices-fast-automotive-development|title=WIKISPEED \u2013 Applying Agile software principles and practices for fast automotive development|date=December 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Agile Business Management Consortium |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Finance and [[Human Resources]].\n\n=== Scrumban ===\n{{Main|Scrumban}}\n\nScrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.\n\nThe major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />\n\n=== Scrum of scrums ===\n\nThe scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management \u2013 How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\nThis should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?\n* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?\n* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?\n* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?\n\nAs [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />\n\n<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>\n\n===Large-scale Scrum===\nLarge-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.\n\nThere are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works. In 2013, the experiments were solidified into the LeSS framework rules.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014 |title=Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)|url=http://less.works}}</ref> The intention of LeSS is to 'descale' organization complexity, dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solutions, and solving them in simpler ways.
