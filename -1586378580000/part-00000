Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H. Norton and Company Store -1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and broke in the jail, shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| work=| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Downing's last stand==\n[[File:Willcox-Alley in Marley St.jpg|200px|thumb|An alley in Willcox]][[File:Willcox-Cemetery-Willcox Pioneer Cemetery-1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried]]\nDowning returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot was fired by Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name                      = Bill Downing \n| image                     = Bill Downing.jpg\n| image_size                = 200px\n| caption                   =  William \"Bill\" Downing\n| birth_name                = Allegedly: Frank Jackson\n| birth_date                = 1860\n| birth_place               = [[Texas]]\n| death_date                =August 5, 1908\n| death_place               = [[Willcox, Arizona]]\n| resting_place             = Old City Cemetery in Willcox, Az\n| nationality               = American\n| other_names               = William F.

Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol. Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. Am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H.

Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and broke in the jail, shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| work=| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Downing's last stand==\n[[File:Willcox-Alley in Marley St.jpg|200px|thumb|An alley in Willcox]][[File:Willcox-Cemetery-Willcox Pioneer Cemetery-1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried]]\nDowning returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot was fired by Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "name_user": "Marine 69-71", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor:fixes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Downing"}

His father owns the second most profitable [[grocery store]] in the town. To earn money, Dexter works part-time as a teenage [[caddy]] at a [[golf club]] in [[White Bear Lake, Minnesota|Black Bear Lake, Minnesota]], where he meets the eleven-year-old Judy Jones. He quits his job rather than be Judy's caddy as he cannot abide acting as one of her obsequious servants.\n\nAfter college, Dexter becomes involved in a partnership in a laundry business. He returns to the Sherry Island Golf Club and is invited to play golf with the affluent men for whom he once caddied. He encounters Judy Jones again on the golf course, only now she is older and more beautiful. Later in the evening on [[White Bear Lake (Minnesota)|Black Bear Lake]], Dexter swims to a raft where he encounters Judy who is piloting a [[motor boat]]. She asks him to drive the boat while she rides on an attached [[surfboard]]. After this encounter, Judy invites Dexter to dinner, and a romance blossoms. However, he soon discovers that he is merely one of a dozen [[Boyfriend|beau]]s whom she is clandestinely romancing.\n\nAfter eighteen months, while Judy is vacationing in [[Florida]], Dexter becomes engaged to [[Zelda Sayre|Irene Scheerer]], a kind-hearted but ordinary-looking girl. When Judy returns, however, she again ensnares Dexter's affections and asks him to marry her. Dexter breaks off his engagement with Irene, only to be unceremoniously dropped again by Judy a month later. Unable to cope with this recurrent [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], Dexter joins the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] to fight in the [[Great War]].\n\nSeven years later, Dexter has become a successful businessman in [[New York City|New York]]. He has become wealthy but hasn't visited his home in years. One particular day, a [[Detroit]] man named Devlin visits Dexter on a business pretext. During the meeting, Devlin reveals that Judy Simms\u2014formerly Judy Jones\u2014is the wife of one his friends. Devlin recounts how Judy's beauty has faded, and her husband treats her callously. This news demoralizes Dexter as he still loves Judy. Later Dexter realizes that his dream is gone and that he can never return home. \n\n== Critical response ==\nFitzgerald biographer [[Matthew J. Bruccoli|Matthew Bruccoli]] described \"Winter Dreams\" as \"the strongest of the Gatsby-cluster stories.\"{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}} He continues:\n{{quote|Like the novel, it examines a boy whose ambitions become identified with a selfish rich girl. Indeed, Fitzgerald removed Dexter Green's response to Judy Jones' home from the magazine text and wrote it into the novel as [[Jay Gatsby]]'s response to [[Daisy Buchanan|Daisy Fay]]'s home.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}}}}\n\nScholar Tim Randell has asserted that \"Winter Dreams\" should be regarded as a crowning literary achievement as Fitzgerald \"achieves a dialectical [[metafiction]]\" in which he deftly criticizes \"class relations and [[print culture]].\"{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=110}} Fitzgerald's short story \"identifies ruling class interests as the collective origin of meaning and 'reality' for the entire social body\" and \"conveys the possibility of counter, collective meanings\" driven by [[class struggle|class antagonism]].{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=110}} Randell argues that the story chronicles a young man's alienation with [[modernity]] due to a \"lack of communal meaning\" and his self-conscious descent into [[despair]] and [[melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=123}} \n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Bruccoli | first = Matthew Joseph | author-link = Matthew J.

Scott Fitzgerald]] that was first published in ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York City)|Metropolitan]]'' magazine in December 1922 and later collected in ''[[All the Sad Young Men]]'' in 1926.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}}{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=109}} The story, frequently anthologized,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}} is regarded as one of Fitzgerald's finest works \"for poignantly portraying the loss of youthful illusions.\"{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn the Fitzgerald canon, the story is considered to be in the \"Gatsby-cluster\" as many of its themes were later expanded upon in his famous novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' in 1925.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}} Writing his editor [[Maxwell Perkins|Max Perkins]] in June 1925, Fitzgerald described \"Winter Dreams\" as \"a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea.\"{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1995|p=121}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Ginevra King|F. Scott Fitzgerald}}\nThe short story was based upon Fitzgerald's [[Unrequited love|unsuccessful romantic pursuit]] of [[socialite]] [[Ginevra King]].{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=53\u201359}}{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=109}} A wealthy [[Inheritance|heiress]] from a [[Chicago]] [[financier|banking]] family, Ginevra enjoyed a [[Social privilege|privileged upbringing]] and was feted in the Chicago [[Social environment|social scene]] as a member of the elite \"[[Chicago's Big Four (debutantes)|Big Four]]\" [[debutante]]s during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Diamond|2012}}{{sfn|Corrigan|2014|p=59}} While teenagers, Ginevra and Fitzgerald met at a [[sledding|sledding party]] and shared an [[unconsummated]] romance from 1915 to 1917, but their budding relationship soon ended when Ginevra's imperious father, Charles G. King, publicly humiliated the impressionable young writer and bluntly told him that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.\"{{sfn|Corrigan|2014|p=61}}{{sfn|Smith|2003}} Heeding her father's advice, Ginevra spurned Fitzgerald due to his lack of financial prospects.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=53\u201359}} Fitzgerald later claimed that Ginevra had rejected him \"with the most supreme boredom and indifference.\"{{sfn|Noden|2003}} Purportedly, \"Fitzgerald was so smitten by King that for years he could not think of her without tears coming to his eyes.\"{{sfn|Noden|2003}}\n\n== Plot summary ==\n[[File:Ginevra King Portrait June 1915.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Chicago socialite [[Ginevra King]]\u2014whom Fitzgerald romantically pursued\u2014inspired the character of Judy Jones.{{sfn|Bruccoli|2002|pp=53\u201359}}]]\nDexter Green is a [[middle-class]] young man born in rural [[Minnesota]] who aspires to be part of the \"[[old money]]\" elite of the [[American Midwest]]. His father owns the second most profitable [[grocery store]] in the town. To earn money, Dexter works part-time as a teenage [[caddy]] at a [[golf club]] in [[White Bear Lake, Minnesota|Black Bear Lake, Minnesota]], where he meets the eleven-year-old Judy Jones. He quits his job rather than be Judy's caddy as he cannot abide acting as one of her obsequious servants.\n\nAfter college, Dexter becomes involved in a partnership in a laundry business. He returns to the Sherry Island Golf Club and is invited to play golf with the affluent men for whom he once caddied. He encounters Judy Jones again on the golf course, only now she is older and more beautiful. Later in the evening on [[White Bear Lake (Minnesota)|Black Bear Lake]], Dexter swims to a raft where he encounters Judy who is piloting a [[motor boat]]. She asks him to drive the boat while she rides on an attached [[surfboard]]. After this encounter, Judy invites Dexter to dinner, and a romance blossoms. However, he soon discovers that he is merely one of a dozen [[Boyfriend|beau]]s whom she is clandestinely romancing.\n\nAfter eighteen months, while Judy is vacationing in [[Florida]], Dexter becomes engaged to [[Zelda Sayre|Irene Scheerer]], a kind-hearted but ordinary-looking girl. When Judy returns, however, she again ensnares Dexter's affections and asks him to marry her. Dexter breaks off his engagement with Irene, only to be unceremoniously dropped again by Judy a month later. Unable to cope with this recurrent [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], Dexter joins the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] to fight in the [[Great War]].\n\nSeven years later, Dexter has become a successful businessman in [[New York City|New York]]. He has become wealthy but hasn't visited his home in years. One particular day, a [[Detroit]] man named Devlin visits Dexter on a business pretext. During the meeting, Devlin reveals that Judy Simms\u2014formerly Judy Jones\u2014is the wife of one his friends. Devlin recounts how Judy's beauty has faded, and her husband treats her callously. This news demoralizes Dexter as he still loves Judy. Later Dexter realizes that his dream is gone and that he can never return home. \n\n== Critical response ==\nFitzgerald biographer [[Matthew J. Bruccoli|Matthew Bruccoli]] described \"Winter Dreams\" as \"the strongest of the Gatsby-cluster stories.\"{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}} He continues:\n{{quote|Like the novel, it examines a boy whose ambitions become identified with a selfish rich girl. Indeed, Fitzgerald removed Dexter Green's response to Judy Jones' home from the magazine text and wrote it into the novel as [[Jay Gatsby]]'s response to [[Daisy Buchanan|Daisy Fay]]'s home.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1989|p=217}}}}\n\nScholar Tim Randell has asserted that \"Winter Dreams\" should be regarded as a crowning literary achievement as Fitzgerald \"achieves a dialectical [[metafiction]]\" in which he deftly criticizes \"class relations and [[print culture]].\"{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=110}} Fitzgerald's short story \"identifies ruling class interests as the collective origin of meaning and 'reality' for the entire social body\" and \"conveys the possibility of counter, collective meanings\" driven by [[class struggle|class antagonism]].{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=110}} Randell argues that the story chronicles a young man's alienation with [[modernity]] due to a \"lack of communal meaning\" and his self-conscious descent into [[despair]] and [[melancholy]].{{sfn|Randell|2012|p=123}} \n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Bruccoli | first = Matthew Joseph | author-link = Matthew J.

He was educated at Bridlington School.  He learned his father's trade and later headed the family business, often working at the forge himself until only a few years before his death. In 1900 he married Elizabeth Ann Adamson; they had two daughters.<ref>Obituary, The Times, 6.8.56</ref>\n\n==Yorkshire public life==\nFenby was important in local public life. Appointed a [[magistrate]] in 1910, he was for many years the Chairman of the [[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] magistrates and he succeeded the [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]] as chairman of quarter sessions.  He was also Chairman of the East Riding Summary Jurisdiction Appeals Committee and vice-Chairman of the [[Rates (tax)|Rating Appeals Committee]], the rates being a question he later addressed in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].<ref>The Times, 12.2.27</ref> He was granted an extension to serve as a magistrate by the [[Lord Chancellor]] and only finally retired from the Bench in 1951. In the 1940s he was a member of the Management Committee of the Bridlington Hospital.<ref>http://www.savebridlingtonhospital.co.uk/bridhistory/bridlingtonhospitalhistory.pdf</ref> He died at his home in Bridlington aged 81.<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nFenby first entered local politics and was [[Mayor]] of [[Bridlington]] and a County Councillor, eventually becoming vice-Chairman of [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]] County Council and an [[Alderman]].  At the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] he unsuccessfully contested the [[Howdenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Howdenshire]] Division of Yorkshire and in the general elections of [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] and [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]] he fought the [[Buckrose (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckrose]] division of Yorkshire. He was successful however at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] when he was elected Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)|East Bradford]], defeating the sitting [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP and [[First Commissioner of Works]], [[Frederick William Jowett]] in a straight fight by just 66 votes.<ref>The Times, 31.10.24</ref> However he lost the seat back to Jowett in the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], although again the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] decided not to put up a candidate. Fenby apparently gained a reputation at Westminster for being unconventional and independent minded and was a good platform speaker. He was well regarded for his knowledge of local government and agricultural and associated issues, which he often championed with the Ministry of Agriculture (e.g. The Times, 24.6.26). He was sometime chairman of the Association of North of England Smallholders and urged the government to provide local authorities with the funds to provide additional smallholdings to keep agricultural labourers on the land and often spoke in favour of smallholders in Parliament.<ref>e.g.The Times, 10.3.25, 21.3.25</ref> He was made a Whip of the English Liberal MPs in 1926.<ref>The Times, 17.11.26</ref>\n\n==The Radical Group==\nInevitably, Fenby was caught up in the turmoil within the Liberal Party arising from the rivalries of [[David Lloyd George]] and [[H H Asquith]]. With Asquith out of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] after 1924, Lloyd George was elected chairman of the Parliamentary Liberal Party. However, there remained a number of Liberals who remained loyal to Asquith, but more importantly, became anti-Lloyd George. \nLed by [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] this group of 'conservative' Asquithians formed the 'Radical Group' in December 1924. Fenby was a founder member of this Radical Group which in 1927 became the Liberal Council, a formal organisation within the party, opposed to the social policies being developed under the leadership of Lloyd George. Fenby's distrust of Lloyd George lasted at least until 1926 when he was one of ten Liberal MPs who voted against his continuing leadership of the Parliamentary party.<ref>R Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party, 1895-1970''; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p.196n</ref>\n\nTwo radical causes Fenby espoused were [[birth control]] and the abolition of [[capital punishment]]. In April 1926 he was a signatory to a letter to the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', along with [[Bertrand Russell]], [[H N Brailsford]] and [[Violet Bonham Carter]] - amongst others - urging support for a bill not to withhold birth control information given to married women. In December 1924 he was part of delegation to then Home Secretary, [[Sir William Joynson-Hicks]] unsuccessfully seeking a reprieve from execution for a convicted murderer from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], William Smith (The Times, 9.12.24).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mr-thomas-fenby | Thomas Fenby }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bradford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford East]]\n | years  = [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]]\u2013[[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\n | before = [[Frederick William Jowett|Fred Jowett]]\n | after  = [[Frederick William Jowett|Fred Jowett]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fenby, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1875 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1924\u20131929]]\n[[Category:Politics of Bradford]]\n[[Category:Mayors of places in Yorkshire and the Humber]]\n[[Category:Councillors in the East Riding of Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:People educated at Bridlington School]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Thomas_Fenby.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Fenby]]\n'''Thomas Davis Fenby''' (1875 - 4 August 1956) was a British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal politician]] and [[blacksmith]].\n\n==Early life==\nFenby was born in [[Bridlington]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], the son of a master of a local blacksmith\u2019s [[forge]].

In the intense political debates of the late 1930s over [[appeasement]], he first put his trust in the [[League of Nations]], and later realised that war with Germany was inevitable. He denounced the [[Munich Agreement|Munich agreement]] of 1938 as meaningless, cowardly, and unworkable, as he resigned from the cabinet. When [[Winston Churchill]] became prime minister in May 1940, he named Cooper as [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]]. From 1941, he served in numerous diplomatic roles. His most important role was representative to [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]] (1943\u201344) and ambassador to France from 1944\u201348.\n\n==Background and education==\nDuff Cooper (he was always known as \u201cDuff\u201d rather than \u201cAlfred\u201d) was born at [[Cavendish Square]] on 22 February 1890.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> He was the only son of fashionable society doctor [[Alfred Cooper|Sir Alfred Cooper]] (1843\u20131908), a surgeon and specialist in the sexual problems of the upper classes, and Lady Agnes Duff, daughter of [[James Duff, 5th Earl Fife]]. She had already eloped with two husbands, the first of whom she deserted and the second of whom died, before marrying Cooper in 1882. Duff Cooper had three older sisters.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> He had royal connections: his maternal uncle, [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|the first Duke of Fife]], was married to [[Louise, Princess Royal]]. Cooper enjoyed a typical gentleman's upbringing of country estates and London society. He attended two prep schools, including [[Wixenford School]].<ref>Cooper, Duff. ''[[Old Men Forget]]'' (1953), p. 31</ref> He was unhappy at prep school, but was then very happy at [[Eton College]].<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> One of his maternal great-grandmothers was Lady [[Elizabeth FitzClarence]], an illegitimate daughter of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] who fathered eight children with [[Dorothea Jordan]].\n\n==Oxford and early career==\nAt [[New College, Oxford|New College]] [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1908\u201311), his Eton friendship with [[John Nevile Manners]] won him entry into a famous circle of young aristocrats and intellectuals known as [[the Coterie]], including [[Patrick Shaw-Stewart]], [[Raymond Asquith]], Sir Denis Anson, [[Edward Horner]] and the celebrated [[Lady Diana Manners]]. He cultivated a reputation for eloquence and fast living and although he had established a reputation as a poet, he earned an even stronger reputation for gambling, womanising, and drinking in his studied emulation of the life of the 18th and 19th century Whig statesman [[Charles James Fox]]. Cooper's memory and gift for writing enabled him to do well at exams. He narrowly missed a first in Modern History.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nFollowing Oxford, he entered the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Foreign Service]] in October 1913, at the third attempt.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nDuring the war he worked in the commercial and the contraband departments.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> Owing to the national importance of his work at the cipher desk, he was exempted from military service until June 1917, when he joined the [[Grenadier Guards]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD/GBR/0014/DUFC|title=The Papers of Alfred Duff Cooper (1st Viscount Norwich)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Cooper, Duff}}</ref> He had not actively sought to join the Army but was happy to be \u201creleased\u201d as a result of the manpower shortage, as he thought joining the Army the decent thing to do. To his surprise most of his fellow officer cadets were working class and lower-middle-class men, almost all of whom had already served in the ranks (''Old Men Forget'', p66).<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nHe spent six months at the front in the Guards, where he proved himself to be both brave and a natural leader. He suffered a minor wound in the advance to the Albert Canal in August 1918, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for conspicuous gallantry, a rare decoration for a junior officer.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nAlmost all his closest friends, including Shaw-Stewart, Horner and Asquith were killed in the war, drawing him closer to Lady Diana Manners, an extremely popular social figure hailed for her beauty and eccentricities. His service in the First World War was highlighted by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme ''The Great War: The People's Story'', where his correspondence with Diana Cooper was one of those selected to be dramatised.\n\n==Postwar and marriage==\n\nAfter demobilisation he returned to the Egypt Department, and was then Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (i.e. assistant to the junior minister). He needed money to enter politics.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nOn 2 June 1919 he married Lady Diana Manners, whose family were initially opposed to the match. Diana's mother, in particular thought Duff a promiscuous drinker and gambler, without title, position, or wealth. Diana was officially the daughter of the [[Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland|8th Duke of Rutland]], but was widely believed \u2013 including by herself \u2013 to be the natural daughter of [[Harry Cust]], a Belvoir Castle neighbour, and M.P. She tolerated Cooper's numerous affairs.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nCooper's affairs included the Franco-American Singer sewing-machine heiress [[Daisy Fellowes]], the socialite [[Gloria Guinness]], the French novelist [[Louise Leveque de Vilmorin]] and the writer [[Susan Mary Alsop]] (then an American diplomat's wife, by whom he had an illegitimate son, William Patten Jr, who later fathered [[W. Samuel Patten]].).<ref>''Vanity Fair'' (February 2006)</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/08/nduff08.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/01/08/ixhome.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Revealed: Duff Cooper's secret second son|first1=Ben|last1=Sheppard|first2=Andrew|last2=Alderson|date=8 January 2006|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bangordailynews.com/2018/08/31/national-politics/maine-native-who-consulted-in-washington-pleads-guilty-to-violating-lobbyist-disclosure-law/|title=Maine native who consulted in Washington pleads guilty to violating lobbyist disclosure law|work=Bangor Daily News|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/fashion/susan-mary-alsop-a-two-continent-hostess.html|title=Susan Mary Alsop: a Two-Continent Hostess|last=Schillinger|first=Liesl|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe polo player [[Boy Capel|'Boy' Capel]]'s wife Diana and the Anglo-Irish socialite and fashion model [[Maxime de la Falaise]] were two more, although Lady Diana reportedly did not mind and loved him nonetheless, explaining to their son that \"They were the flowers, but I was the tree.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2008/06/04/ftjohn104.xml|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=John Julius Norwich:'Deep down, I'm shallow.

The money enabled Cooper to resign from the Foreign Office in July 1924.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\n==Political career 1924-39==\n===1924-31: in and out of Parliament===\nWithin weeks Cooper was selected for the winnable seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]], where he was elected at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|General Election in October 1924]], with a 13,000 majority over the sitting Labour member. He made a very successful maiden speech on Egypt, which was praised by [[H. A. L. Fisher]] who spoke next. He was seen as a coming man, along with Eden and Macmillan (who was then regarded as a man with a future, unlike in the 1930s). Cooper was a stalwart supporter of Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], and a friend of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Winston Churchill]]. In January 1928 he was appointed [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]], not a job he would have chosen. The Secretary of State Sir [[Laming Worthington-Evans]] gave him a lot of responsibility. He very likely would have been promoted if the Conservatives had won the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|election in 1929]], but they were defeated and Cooper lost his own seat.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\n[[John Julius Norwich|John Julius]], his only legitimate child, was born in 1929.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nOut of Parliament he wrote a short biography of the French statesman [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. He wrote slowly but seldom needed to revise his drafts. [[Philip Ziegler]] writes that \u201crarely can subject and author have been more satisfactorily matched\u201d as both men were worldly and disliked cant.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref> The book was eventually published in 1932 by his nephew [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] to critical praise and lasting success.<ref>Cooper, 2001 (1932).</ref>\n\n===1931-5: by-election and junior minister===\n[[1931 Westminster St George's by-election|The March 1931 by-election]] for the constituency of [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster St George's]] (caused by the death of Cooper's recent boss, Laming Worthington-Evans), saw [[Beaverbrook]]'s [[Empire Free Trade Crusade]] party threatening the Conservative position at a time when satisfaction with Baldwin's leadership was at a low. When the original Conservative candidate stepped down, Duff Cooper agreed to contest the election in what was regarded as a referendum on Baldwin's leadership. He won the seat with a majority of 5,710, thus returning to Parliament and serving until 1945.<ref>Peele, Gillian ''\"St George's and the Empire Crusade\"'' in Cook, Chris and Ramsden, John (eds/) ''By-elections in British politics''. UCL Press, 1997</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nIn August 1931, on the formation of the National Government, he was appointed [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]] under the elderly [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], who left Cooper to do a great deal of the work. In June 1934 he was appointed [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], a traditional stepping stone to the Cabinet. This brought him close to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Neville Chamberlain]], who thought highly of him. He had been to Germany, and had seen and been appalled by a Nuremberg Rally. Chamberlain told him to tone down his criticisms of Hitler. Cooper urged rearmament, not then a fashionable view, and briefed Churchill, then on the backbenches, that Hitler was serious and wanted war.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nCooper wrote the official biography of [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Haig]], which appeared in 1935 and 1936. It was criticised for pro-Haig bias and what Ziegler calls \u201clack of consideration\u201d.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\n===1935-8: Cabinet and resignation===\n{{Further|Appeasement}}\nIn November 1935, after the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], Cooper was promoted to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for War]]. He was appointed to the Privy Council. During the [[Abdication Crisis]] he was sympathetic to Edward VIII and to the possibility of a morganatic marriage, and in vain advised him to wait until after his coronation (due in 1937) before picking a fight with the government over his plans to marry Wallis Simpson.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nHe felt out of kilter with the Conservative leadership and was surprised when the new Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed him [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] in May 1937. Philip Ziegler writes that his tenure of office was \u201can unequivocal success\u201d. He enjoyed high living on board the Admiralty yacht [[HMS Enchantress (L56)|HMS Enchantress]], but fought Chamberlain and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] for more spending on the Royal Navy. Chamberlain saw him as indiscreet and as a firebrand; by the time of the [[Munich Agreement]] with [[Adolf Hitler]] Cooper was isolated in the Cabinet as the most public critic of Chamberlain's appeasement policy.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nOn 3 October 1938, a few days after the Munich Agreement, he denounced it and resigned from the Cabinet.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref> On doing so he said, \"War with honour or peace with dishonour,\" he might have been persuaded to accept, \"but war with dishonour\u2014that was too much.\"<ref name=\"A History of England in 100 places\">{{cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=A History of England in 100 places|year=2011|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=978-1-84854-606-6|pages=425}}</ref> Fellow appeasement-critic and Conservative Party MP  [[Vyvyan Adams]] described Cooper's actions as \"the first step in the road back to national sanity.\"\n\nAs a backbencher he joined the coterie around [[Anthony Eden]] (who had resigned as Foreign Secretary in February 1938), but made only muted criticisms of the Government. His main source of income was writing articles for the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]''. He argued for an Anglo-French alliance.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy now Cooper appeared in German propaganda as one of Britain's three most dangerous Conservative warmongers.<ref name=\"stenton2000\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=019820843X | title=Radio London and Resistance in Occupied Europe: British Political Warfare 1939\u20131943|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Stenton, Michael|year=2000|pages=9\u201310|isbn=0-19-820843-X}}</ref> Unlike Churchill and Eden, Cooper was not offered a job on the outbreak of war in September 1939. He went on a lecture tour of the US, where he called for the democracies to stand firm against the dictatorships, and predicted that Churchill would become Prime Minister, which seemed an eccentric prediction at the time.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>   Cooper later took a prominent role in the famous [[Norway Debate]] of 1940, which led to Chamberlain's downfall.\n\nFrom May 1940 he was [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]] under Churchill, but disliked the job. The press portrayed him as a spin doctor and as an enemy of a free press. His inquirers into the state of public morale were known as \u201cCooper\u2019s snoopers\u201d. He authorised a strong denunciation of the author [[PG Wodehouse]] for making an ill-advised humorous broadcast from Berlin.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref> He and Lady Diana sent their eleven-year-old son to the US in 1940 as they feared that being on Hitler's blacklist they would not survive in case of an invasion. John Julius returned two years later.\n\nIn July 1941 he was appointed [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], to his relief.  He was sent to Singapore as Minister Resident. He had authority to form a War Cabinet there, but both military and civil authorities were reluctant to cooperate with him. To his relief [[Archibald Wavell]] was appointed Supreme Commander [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA]]. He was - unfairly in Philip Ziegler's view - blamed for the [[Fall of Singapore]] after his return to the UK. Eighteen months of underemployment followed. He chaired the Cabinet Committee on Security. He did a lot of writing and spent his weekends at Bognor where his wife had a smallholding.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\n==Ambassador to France==\nIn December 1943 Cooper was appointed British Representative on the [[Free French]] [[French Committee of National Liberation|Committee of National Liberation (FCLN)]]. His remit included maintaining a working relationship between Churchill and de Gaulle, two men whom he found equally difficult. Paris was [[Liberation of Paris|liberated]] in August 1944 and he moved there in September. On 18 November 1944 he formally presented his credentials as [[List of ambassadors from the United Kingdom to France|British Ambassador to France]]. He was to prove a very popular ambassador, with Lady Diana helping to make his term of office a great social success. Some contemporary eyebrows were raised at his willingness to entertain people with dubious records during the recent war, or his lack of interest at entertaining trade unionists.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nCooper was in the words of the British historian P. M. H. Bell such a \"devoted Francophile\" that during his time as ambassador to Paris that he often tried the patience of the Foreign Office by going well beyond his instructions to maintain good relations with France by trying to create an Anglo-French alliance that would dominate post-war Europe.<ref>Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940\u20131994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 72.</ref>\n\nDespite being a Conservative, Cooper was not replaced as Ambassador when Labour won the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] as [[Ernest Bevin]], the new Foreign Secretary, valued an ambassador who was close friends with so many French politicians and even managed to have a friendship of sorts with the famously Anglophobic Charles de Gaulle.<ref>Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940\u20131994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 72.</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nIn January 1947, Cooper, acting without orders, began the process that led to the [[Treaty of Dunkirk]] when he suggested to the French Premier [[Leon Blum]] that there should an Anglo-French military alliance, an idea Blum took up thinking this was an offer from London.<ref>Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940\u20131994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 74.</ref> The Treaty, which fulfilled his long-held desire for an Anglo-French alliance, was signed on 4 March 1947. His term as ambassador ended at the end of 1947.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nHe bequeathed a large part of his library to the British Embassy in Paris. To the dismay of his successor he remained in Paris, living at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Firmin in the Park of Chantilly.<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref>\n\n==Family==\nDuff Cooper was married to Lady Diana Manners from 1919 to his death. Cooper's only legitimate child, [[John Julius Norwich]] (1929\u20132018), whose godfather was [[Lord Beaverbrook]],<ref>{{harvnb|Kidd|1988}}</ref> became well known as a writer and television host.<ref>Norwich, 2005.</ref> His granddaughter [[Artemis Cooper]] has published several books, including ''A Durable Fire: The Letters of Duff and Diana Cooper, 1913\u201350''. Another granddaughter is screenwriter [[Allegra Huston]], the only child of Norwich and [[Enrica Soma Huston]], estranged wife of the American film director [[John Huston]]. Duff Cooper's niece Enid Levita (daughter of his sister Stephanie), is the paternal grandmother of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]], who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] from 2010\u20132016.\n\n==Retirement==\nCooper was raised to [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] in 1948.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Peerage|title=Page 1600|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1600.htm|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe took on some company directorships, including that of the [[Wagons-Lits]] company, but essentially devoted the rest of his life to writing. During the war he had written a life of the Biblical King David, and in 1949 he published ''Sergeant Shakespeare'', a book about Shakespeare's early life. The Cabinet Office tried in vain, on security grounds, to block publication of his only novel, ''Operation Heartbreak'' (1950), as it was based on the real [[Operation Mincemeat]], a successful British [[Disinformation|deception operation]] of the Second World War to disguise the 1943 [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The book has recently been republished by [[Persephone Books]].<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref>\n\nHe was created '''[[Viscount Norwich]]''', of [[Aldwick]] in the [[Sussex|County of Sussex]], in 1952, in recognition of his political and literary career.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39592 |date=8 July 1952 |page=3699}}</ref> The title was not popular with some of the local dignitaries of that city.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref> His wife refused to be called Lady Norwich, claiming that it sounded too much like \"porridge\" and promptly took out a newspaper advertisement declaring that she would retain her previous style of Lady Diana Cooper.\nCooper's sixth and final book was his acclaimed memoirs, ''[[Old Men Forget]]'', which appeared on 5 July 1953.<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref> ''The Duff Cooper Diaries: 1915\u20131951'', edited by his son John Julius Norwich, appeared posthumously in 2005.<ref>Norwich, 2005.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCooper was intemperate in his drinking habits throughout his adult life. As a consequence he suffered a dangerous gastro-intestinal haemorrhage on 31 December 1953 when he was on board the French liner ''Colombie''. The ship's doctor was unable to arrest the bleeding and he died suddenly, from hypovolaemic shock, on 1 January 1954 aged 63.

However, he was \u201cnever mean or ignoble\u201d and was \u201ca proud patriot\u201d who sometimes had \u201ctrue nobility\u201d, although he was \u201ctoo proud to court popularity\u201d and too reserved to attract it readily.<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[H. G. Wells]], in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1934, predicted a Second World War in which Britain would not participate but would vainly try to effect a peaceful compromise. In this vision, Duff Cooper was mentioned as one of several prominent Britons delivering \"brilliant pacific speeches\" which \"echo throughout Europe\" but fail to end the war; the other would-be peacemakers, in Wells' vision, included [[Hore Belisha|Leslie Hore Belisha]], [[Ellen Wilkinson]] and [[Randolph Churchill]].<ref>[[H.

February 1890 \u2013 1 January 1954), known as '''Duff Cooper''', was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician, diplomat and military and political historian. In the intense political debates of the late 1930s over [[appeasement]], he first put his trust in the [[League of Nations]], and later realised that war with Germany was inevitable. He denounced the [[Munich Agreement|Munich agreement]] of 1938 as meaningless, cowardly, and unworkable, as he resigned from the cabinet. When [[Winston Churchill]] became prime minister in May 1940, he named Cooper as [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]]. From 1941, he served in numerous diplomatic roles. His most important role was representative to [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]] (1943\u201344) and ambassador to France from 1944\u201348.\n\n==Background and education==\nDuff Cooper (he was always known as \u201cDuff\u201d rather than \u201cAlfred\u201d) was born at [[Cavendish Square]] on 22 February 1890.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> He was the only son of fashionable society doctor [[Alfred Cooper|Sir Alfred Cooper]] (1843\u20131908), a surgeon and specialist in the sexual problems of the upper classes, and Lady Agnes Duff, daughter of [[James Duff, 5th Earl Fife]]. She had already eloped with two husbands, the first of whom she deserted and the second of whom died, before marrying Cooper in 1882. Duff Cooper had three older sisters.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> He had royal connections: his maternal uncle, [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|the first Duke of Fife]], was married to [[Louise, Princess Royal]]. Cooper enjoyed a typical gentleman's upbringing of country estates and London society. He attended two prep schools, including [[Wixenford School]].<ref>Cooper, Duff. ''[[Old Men Forget]]'' (1953), p. 31</ref> He was unhappy at prep school, but was then very happy at [[Eton College]].<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> One of his maternal great-grandmothers was Lady [[Elizabeth FitzClarence]], an illegitimate daughter of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] who fathered eight children with [[Dorothea Jordan]].\n\n==Oxford and early career==\nAt [[New College, Oxford|New College]] [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1908\u201311), his Eton friendship with [[John Nevile Manners]] won him entry into a famous circle of young aristocrats and intellectuals known as [[the Coterie]], including [[Patrick Shaw-Stewart]], [[Raymond Asquith]], Sir Denis Anson, [[Edward Horner]] and the celebrated [[Lady Diana Manners]]. He cultivated a reputation for eloquence and fast living and although he had established a reputation as a poet, he earned an even stronger reputation for gambling, womanising, and drinking in his studied emulation of the life of the 18th and 19th century Whig statesman [[Charles James Fox]]. Cooper\u2019s memory and gift for writing enabled him to do well at exams. He narrowly missed a first in Modern History.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nFollowing Oxford, he entered the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Foreign Service]] in October 1913, at the third attempt.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nDuring the war he worked in the commercial and the contraband departments.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref> Owing to the national importance of his work at the cipher desk, he was exempted from military service until June 1917, when he joined the [[Grenadier Guards]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD/GBR/0014/DUFC|title=The Papers of Alfred Duff Cooper (1st Viscount Norwich)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last=Cooper, Duff}}</ref> He had not actively sought to join the Army but was happy to be \u201creleased\u201d as a result of the manpower shortage, as he thought joining the Army the decent thing to do. To his surprise most of his fellow officer cadets were working class and lower middle class men, almost all of whom had already served in the ranks (''Old Men Forget'', p66).<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nHe spent six months at the front in the Guards, where he proved himself to be both brave and a natural leader. He suffered a minor wound in the advance to the Albert Canal in August 1918, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for conspicuous gallantry, a rare decoration for a junior officer.<ref>Matthew 2004, p240</ref>\n\nAlmost all his closest friends, including Shaw-Stewart, Horner and Asquith were killed in the war, drawing him closer to Lady Diana Manners, an extremely popular social figure hailed for her beauty and eccentricities. His service in the First World War was highlighted by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme ''The Great War: The People's Story'', where his correspondence with Diana Cooper was one of those selected to be dramatised.\n\n==Postwar and marriage==\n\nAfter demobilisation he returned to the Egypt Department, and was then Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (i.e. assistant to the junior minister). He needed money to enter politics.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nOn 2 June 1919 he married Lady Diana Manners, whose family were initially opposed to the match. Diana's mother, in particular thought Duff a promiscuous drinker and gambler, without title, position, or wealth. Diana was officially the daughter of the [[Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland|8th Duke of Rutland]], but was widely believed \u2013 including by herself \u2013 to be the natural daughter of [[Harry Cust]], a Belvoir Castle neighbour, and M.P. She tolerated Cooper's numerous affairs.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nCooper's affairs included the Franco-American Singer sewing-machine heiress [[Daisy Fellowes]], the socialite [[Gloria Guinness]], the French novelist [[Louise Leveque de Vilmorin]] and the writer [[Susan Mary Alsop]] (then an American diplomat's wife, by whom he had an illegitimate son, William Patten Jr, who later fathered [[W. Samuel Patten]].).<ref>''Vanity Fair'' (February 2006)</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/08/nduff08.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/01/08/ixhome.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Revealed: Duff Cooper's secret second son|first1=Ben|last1=Sheppard|first2=Andrew|last2=Alderson|date=8 January 2006|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bangordailynews.com/2018/08/31/national-politics/maine-native-who-consulted-in-washington-pleads-guilty-to-violating-lobbyist-disclosure-law/|title=Maine native who consulted in Washington pleads guilty to violating lobbyist disclosure law|work=Bangor Daily News|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/fashion/susan-mary-alsop-a-two-continent-hostess.html|title=Susan Mary Alsop: a Two-Continent Hostess|last=Schillinger|first=Liesl|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe polo player [[Boy Capel|'Boy' Capel]]'s wife Diana and the Anglo-Irish socialite and fashion model [[Maxime de la Falaise]] were two more, although Lady Diana reportedly did not mind and loved him nonetheless, explaining to their son that \"They were the flowers, but I was the tree.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2008/06/04/ftjohn104.xml|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=John Julius Norwich:'Deep down, I'm shallow.

The money enabled Cooper to resign from the Foreign Office in July 1924.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\n==Political career 1924-39==\n===1924-31: in and out of Parliament===\nWithin weeks Cooper was selected for the winnable seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]], where he was elected at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|General Election in October 1924]], with a 13,000 majority over the sitting Labour member. He made a very successful maiden speech on Egypt, which was praised by [[H. A. L. Fisher]] who spoke next. He was seen as a coming man, along with Eden and Macmillan (who was then regarded as a man with a future, unlike in the 1930s). Cooper was a stalwart supporter of Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], and a friend of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Winston Churchill]]. In January 1928 he was appointed [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]], not a job he would have chosen. The Secretary of State Sir [[Laming Worthington-Evans]] gave him a lot of responsibility. He very likely would have been promoted if the Conservatives had won the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|election in 1929]], but they were defeated and Cooper lost his own seat.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\n[[John Julius Norwich|John Julius]], his only legitimate child, was born in 1929.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nOut of Parliament he wrote a short biography of the French statesman [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. He wrote slowly but seldom needed to revise his drafts. [[Philip Ziegler]] writes that \u201crarely can subject and author have been more satisfactorily matched\u201d as both men were worldly and disliked cant.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref> The book was eventually published in 1932 by his nephew [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] to critical praise and lasting success.<ref>Cooper, 2001 (1932).</ref>\n\n===1931-5: by-election and junior minister===\n[[1931 Westminster St George's by-election|The March 1931 by-election]] for the constituency of [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster St George's]] (caused by the death of Cooper's recent boss, Laming Worthington-Evans), saw [[Beaverbrook]]'s [[Empire Free Trade Crusade]] party threatening the Conservative position at a time when satisfaction with Baldwin's leadership was at a low. When the original Conservative candidate stepped down, Duff Cooper agreed to contest the election in what was regarded as a referendum on Baldwin's leadership. He won the seat with a majority of 5,710, thus returning to Parliament and serving until 1945.<ref>Peele, Gillian ''\"St George's and the Empire Crusade\"'' in Cook, Chris and Ramsden, John (eds/) ''By-elections in British politics''. UCL Press, 1997</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nIn August 1931, on the formation of the National Government, he was appointed [[Financial Secretary to the War Office]] under the elderly [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], who left Cooper to do a great deal of the work. In June 1934 he was appointed [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]], a traditional stepping stone to the Cabinet. This brought him close to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Neville Chamberlain]], who thought highly of him. He had been to Germany, and had seen and been appalled by a Nuremberg Rally. Chamberlain told him to tone down his criticisms of Hitler. Cooper urged rearmament, not then a fashionable view, and briefed Churchill, then on the backbenches, that Hitler was serious and wanted war.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nCooper wrote the official biography of [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Haig]], which appeared in 1935 and 1936. It was criticised for pro-Haig bias and what Ziegler calls \u201clack of consideration\u201d.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\n===1935-8: Cabinet and resignation===\n{{Further|Appeasement}}\nIn November 1935, after the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|General Election]], Cooper was promoted to the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for War]]. He was appointed to the Privy Council. During the [[Abdication Crisis]] he was sympathetic to Edward VIII and to the possibility of a morganatic marriage, and in vain advised him to wait until after his coronation (due in 1937) before picking a fight with the government over his plans to marry Wallis Simpson.<ref>Matthew 2004, p241</ref>\n\nHe felt out of kilter with the Conservative leadership and was surprised when the new Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed him [[List of the First Lords of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] in May 1937. Philip Ziegler writes that his tenure of office was \u201can unequivocal success\u201d. He enjoyed high living on board the Admiralty yacht [[HMS Enchantress (L56)|HMS Enchantress]], but fought Chamberlain and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] for more spending on the Royal Navy. Chamberlain saw him as indiscreet and as a firebrand; by the time of the [[Munich Agreement]] with [[Adolf Hitler]] Cooper was isolated in the Cabinet as the most public critic of Chamberlain's appeasement policy.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nOn 3 October 1938, a few days after the Munich Agreement, he denounced it and resigned from the Cabinet.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref> On doing so he said, \"War with honour or peace with dishonour,\" he might have been persuaded to accept, \"but war with dishonour\u2014that was too much.\"<ref name=\"A History of England in 100 places\">{{cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=A History of England in 100 places|year=2011|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=978-1-84854-606-6|pages=425}}</ref> Fellow appeasement-critic and Conservative Party MP  [[Vyvyan Adams]] described Cooper's actions as \"the first step in the road back to national sanity.\"\n\nAs a backbencher he joined the coterie around [[Anthony Eden]] (who had resigned as Foreign Secretary in February 1938), but made only muted criticisms of the Government. His main source of income was writing articles for the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]''. He argued for an Anglo-French alliance.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy now Cooper appeared in German propaganda as one of Britain's three most dangerous Conservative warmongers.<ref name=\"stenton2000\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=019820843X | title=Radio London and Resistance in Occupied Europe: British Political Warfare 1939\u20131943|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Stenton, Michael|year=2000|pages=9\u201310|isbn=0-19-820843-X}}</ref> Unlike Churchill and Eden, Cooper was not offered a job on the outbreak of war in September 1939. He went on a lecture tour of the USA, where he called for the democracies to stand firm against the dictatorships, and predicted that Churchill would become Prime Minister, which seemed an eccentric prediction at the time.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>   Cooper later took a prominent role in the famous [[Norway Debate]] of 1940, which led to Chamberlain's downfall.\n\nFrom May 1940 he was [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Minister of Information]] under Churchill, but disliked the job. The press portrayed him as a spin doctor and as an enemy of a free press. His inquirers into the state of public morale were known as \u201cCooper\u2019s snoopers\u201d. He authorised a strong denunciation of the author [[PG Wodehouse]] for making an ill-advised humorous broadcast from Berlin.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref> He and Lady Diana sent their eleven year old son to the USA in 1940 as they feared that being on Hitler\u00b4s blacklist they would not survive in case of an invasion. John Julius returned two years later.\n\nIn July 1941 he was appointed [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], to his relief.  He was sent to Singapore as Minister Resident. He had authority to form a War Cabinet there, but both military and civil authorities were reluctant to cooperate with him. To his relief [[Archibald Wavell]] was appointed Supreme Commander [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA]]. He was - unfairly in Philip Ziegler's view - blamed for the [[Fall of Singapore]] after his return to the UK. Eighteen months of underemployment followed. He chaired the Cabinet Committee on Security. He did a lot of writing and spent his weekends at Bognor where his wife had a smallholding.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\n==Ambassador to France==\nIn December 1943 Cooper was appointed British Representative on the [[Free French]] [[French Committee of National Liberation|Committee of National Liberation (FCLN)]]. His remit included maintaining a working relationship between Churchill and de Gaulle, two men whom he found equally difficult. Paris was [[Liberation of Paris|liberated]] in August 1944 and he moved there in September. On 18 November 1944 he formally presented his credentials as [[List of ambassadors from the United Kingdom to France|British Ambassador to France]]. He was to prove a very popular ambassador, with Lady Diana helping to make his term of office a great social success. Some contemporary eyebrows were raised at his willingness to entertain people with dubious records during the recent war, or his lack of interest at entertaining trade unionists.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nCooper was in the words of the British historian P. M. H. Bell such a \"devoted Francophile\" that during his time as ambassador to Paris that he often tried the patience of the Foreign Office by going well beyond his instructions to maintain good relations with France by trying to create an Anglo-French alliance that would dominate post-war Europe.<ref>Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940\u20131994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 72.</ref>\n\nDespite being a Conservative, Cooper was not replaced as Ambassador when Labour won the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] as [[Ernest Bevin]], the new Foreign Secretary, valued an ambassador who was close friends with so many French politicians and even managed to have a friendship of sorts with the famously Anglophobic Charles de Gaulle.<ref>Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940\u20131994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 72.</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nIn January 1947, Cooper, acting without orders, began the process that led to the [[Treaty of Dunkirk]] when he suggested to the French Premier [[Leon Blum]] that there should an Anglo-French military alliance, an idea Blum took up thinking this was an offer from London.<ref>Bell, P. M. H. ''France and Britain, 1940\u20131994: The Long Separation'' London: Routledge, 2014 page 74.</ref> The Treaty, which fulfilled his long-held desire for an Anglo-French alliance, was signed on 4 March 1947. His term as ambassador ended at the end of 1947.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref>\n\nHe bequeathed a large part of his library to the British Embassy in Paris. To the dismay of his successor he remained in Paris, living at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Firmin in the Park of Chantilly.<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref>\n\n==Family==\nDuff Cooper was married to Lady Diana Manners from 1919 to his death. Cooper's only legitimate child, [[John Julius Norwich]] (1929\u20132018), whose godfather was [[Lord Beaverbrook]],<ref>{{harvnb|Kidd|1988}}</ref> became well known as a writer and television host.<ref>Norwich, 2005.</ref> His granddaughter [[Artemis Cooper]] has published several books, including ''A Durable Fire: The Letters of Duff and Diana Cooper, 1913\u201350''. Another granddaughter is screenwriter [[Allegra Huston]], the only child of Norwich and [[Enrica Soma Huston]], estranged wife of the American film director [[John Huston]]. Duff Cooper's niece Enid Levita (daughter of his sister Stephanie), is the paternal grandmother of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[David Cameron]], who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] from 2010\u20132016.\n\n==Retirement==\nCooper was raised to [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] in 1948.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Peerage|title=Page 1600|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1600.htm|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe took on some company directorships, including that of the [[Wagons-Lits]] company, but essentially devoted the rest of his life to writing. During the war he had written a life of the Biblical King David, and in 1949 he published ''Sergeant Shakespeare'', a book about Shakespeare\u2019s early life. The Cabinet Office tried in vain, on security grounds, to block publication of his only novel, ''Operation Heartbreak'' (1950), as it was based on the real [[Operation Mincemeat]], a successful British [[Disinformation|deception operation]] of the Second World War to disguise the 1943 [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The book has recently been republished by [[Persephone Books]].<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref>\n\nHe was created '''[[Viscount Norwich]]''', of [[Aldwick]] in the [[Sussex|County of Sussex]], in 1952, in recognition of his political and literary career.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39592 |date=8 July 1952 |page=3699}}</ref> The title was not popular with some of the local dignitaries of that city.<ref>Matthew 2004, p242</ref> His wife refused to be called Lady Norwich, claiming that it sounded too much like \"porridge\" and promptly took out a newspaper advertisement declaring that she would retain her previous style of Lady Diana Cooper.\nCooper's sixth and final book was his acclaimed memoirs, ''[[Old Men Forget]]'', which appeared on 5 July 1953.<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref> ''The Duff Cooper Diaries: 1915\u20131951'', edited by his son John Julius Norwich, appeared posthumously in 2005.<ref>Norwich, 2005.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCooper was intemperate in his drinking habits throughout his adult life. As a consequence he suffered a dangerous gastro-intestinal haemorrhage on 31 December 1953 when he was on board the French liner ''Colombie''. The ship's doctor was unable to arrest the bleeding and he died suddenly, from hypovolaemic shock, on 1 January 1954 aged 63. The ship docked at the Spanish port of [[Vigo]] so his body could be flown back to England,<ref name=\"times52819\">{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Death at Sea of Lord Norwich |day_of_week=Saturday |date=2 January 1954 |page_number=6 |issue=52819 |column= }}</ref><ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref> where he was buried in the graveyard of the Manners family at [[Belvoir Castle]] in the [[Vale of Belvoir]], [[Leicestershire]].<ref>Entry for Duff Cooper in Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/41630895/alfred-duff-cooper</ref> \n\nHis estate was valued for probate at \u00a314,303 7s ({{Inflation|UK|14,303.35|1954|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).<ref>Matthew 2004 p.368</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nAfter Cooper's death, a British literary award, the [[Duff Cooper Prize]], was established in his name.<ref>Charmley, 1997 (1986).</ref>\n\nCooper was the subject of a biography by [[John Charmley]] (1986).\n\nHis biographer [[Philip Ziegler]] wrote that Cooper was \u201cnot totally successful in worldly terms but never dull\u201d. He could be short-tempered and self-indulgent, and devoted far too much time and energy to wine, women and gambling. However, he was \u201cnever mean or ignoble\u201d and was \u201ca proud patriot\u201d who sometimes had \u201ctrue nobility\u201d, although he was \u201ctoo proud to court popularity\u201d and too reserved to attract it readily.<ref>Matthew 2004, p243</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[H. G. Wells]], in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1934, predicted a Second World War in which Britain would not participate but would vainly try to effect a peaceful compromise. In this vision, Duff Cooper was mentioned as one of several prominent Britons delivering \"brilliant pacific speeches\" which \"echo throughout Europe\" but fail to end the war; the other would-be peacemakers, in Wells' vision, included [[Hore Belisha|Leslie Hore Belisha]], [[Ellen Wilkinson]] and [[Randolph Churchill]].<ref>[[H.
