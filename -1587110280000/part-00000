It was composed by Inna alongside Lara Andersson, Michelle Buzz, Junior Oliver Frid and [[Freedo (producer)|Fridolin Walcher]], whilst the latter was credited as a producer under his stage name Freedo. Reviewers noted \"Not My Baby\" to be a [[hi-NRG]]-inspired [[dance-pop]], [[deep house]], [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[europop]] song, as well as a depature from the [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[Gypsy style|gypsy music]]-influenced sound of the singer's Spanish sixth studio album, ''[[Yo (album)|Yo]]'' (2019). Inna had already retransitioned to a more [[Electronic music|electronic]] production with \"[[Bebe (Inna and Vinka song)|Bebe]]\" that same year. The lyrics of \"Not My Baby\" delve on a toxic relationship. Music critics received \"Not My Baby\" with universal acclaim upon release, commending its sound, catchiness and Inna's vocal delivery. For promotional purposes, an [[Animation|animated]] lyric video for the track was uploaded to her [[YouTube]] channel on 2 April, depicting her in different settings.\n\n==Background and composition==\nFor the creation of \"Not My Baby\", Inna enlisted a new team,<ref name=\"aficia\"/> with her contributing to the lyrics and composition alongside Lara Andersson, Michelle Buzz, Junior Oliver Frid and [[Freedo (producer)|Fridolin Walcher]]; the latter produced the song under his stage name Freedo.<ref name=\"lyric\">{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsHufHYawUo|title=Inna \u2013 Not My Baby {{!}} Lyrics Video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2 April 2020|accessdate=13 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411163213/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsHufHYawUo|archive-date=11 April 2020|url-status=live}} ''Note: Open the description for credits.''</ref> [[Global Records]] released \"Not My Baby\" as a [[Single (music)|single]] in various countries on 3 April 2020.<ref name=\"rel\"/> An English language track,<ref name=\"dance\">{{cite news|url=https://www.dance-charts.de/2020041012743/dance-pop-inna-not-my-baby|title=Inna - Not My Baby|publisher=Dance Charts|author=Krusch, Leon|date=11 April 2020|accessdate=13 April 2020|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411161635/https://www.dance-charts.de/2020041012743/dance-pop-inna-not-my-baby|archive-date=11 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> it stylisically marks a comeback to the sound of Inna's early-career releases and a departure from her Spanish [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[Gypsy style|gypsy music]]-influenced material on her sixth studio album, ''[[Yo (album)|Yo]]'' (2019).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://cristinastanciulescu.ro/interviuri/inna-sunt-atinsa-si-de-rau-dar-seara-cand-merg-la-culcare-nu-raul-reprezinta-concluzia-zilei/|title=Inna Interview|language=Romanian|publisher=Cristina Stanciulescu|accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121075603/https://cristinastanciulescu.ro/interviuri/inna-sunt-atinsa-si-de-rau-dar-seara-cand-merg-la-culcare-nu-raul-reprezinta-concluzia-zilei/|archive-date=21 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"idolator\"/> [[Music journalism|Critical commentary]] noted \"Not My Baby\" to be a [[hi-NRG]]-inspired [[dance-pop]], [[deep house]], [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[europop]] song.<ref name=\"dance\"/><ref name=\"idolator\">{{cite news|url=https://www.idolator.com/7909079/romanian-pop-queen-inna-returns-with-not-my-baby?firefox=1|title=Romanian Pop Queen Inna Returns With \"Not My Baby\"|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=7 April 2020|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"celebmix\">{{cite news|url=https://celebmix.com/inna-deep-house-not-my-baby/|title=Inna Delivers Some Deep House In Brand New Single \"Not My Baby\"|publisher=CelebMix|date=5 April 2020|accessdate=13 April 2020|author=Currinn, Jonathan}}</ref><ref name=\"infomusic\">{{cite news|url=https://www.infomusic.ro/lyric-video/inna-not-my-baby/|title=Lyric Video: Inna - Not My Baby|publisher=InfoMusic|date=2 April 2020|accessdate=13 April 2020|author=St\u0103nescu, Alex}}</ref> Lyrically, it touches on a past toxic relationship in which the partner was [[Physical attractiveness|attractive]] yet selfish and untruthful.<ref name=\"idolator\"/><ref name=\"celebmix\"/> Lyrics from the [[Song structure#verse|verse]]s include \"It's not the way it was before, his touch was heaven\" and \"But every rose, it\u2005has\u2005its thorn\", with Inna singing \"He's not my baby, my baby, my baby now / He's not my baby, my baby wouldn't let me down\" at the beginning of the [[refrain]].<ref name=\"idolator\"/> Her voice is aided by a synthesized [[vocoder]] layer, and the production further makes use of a \"melancholic\" occasional piano.<ref name=\"infomusic\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nUpon release, \"Not My Baby\" was received with positive reviews by music critics.

For a few years, it was used as a part of [[NASCAR]]'s early circuit. The first [[NASCAR Cup Series]] race on Southside speedway happened on August 18, 1961. At that time, the track was a 1/4 mile dirt oval. At {{convert|58.86|mph}}, [[Junior Johnson]] took the pole for the 150-lap race in his 1960 [[Pontiac]]. He led every lap of the race that took about 45 minutes to race. By the next year, Southside Speedway had become a 1/3 mile asphalt oval. At {{convert|71.45|mph}}, [[Rex White]] took the pole, but would duck out on lap 134 with engine trouble, which would lead [[Jimmy Pardue]] to win the 200-lap feature in his 1962 Pontiac. [[Richard Petty]] would finish third in that race. Later that season, Rex White's bad luck would continue. After leading 276 laps of a 300 lap feature, he would lose his lead to [[Cliff Stewart]], who would win the event in his 1962 Pontiac. The last main circuit race recorded at Southside Speedway was on May 19, 1963, in which [[Ned Jarrett]] would lead the most laps and win the 300-lap feature in his 1963 Ford. Since this time, Southside Speedway has been used to house several NASCAR syndicated feature series, in which the track has seen great names such as [[Darrell Waltrip]] and [[Bobby Allison]] turn left at the 1/3 mile track.\n\nThroughout the track's history, there has often been one or two single divisions that brought the fans to the track, and several other novelty divisions that have been used by drivers as a stepping stone to the more prominent divisions. Usually, the more prominent division has been any variety of [[late model]] cars or modifieds, and its immediate predecessor division has been the Grand Stock class, or something similar, such as Pure Stocks.\n\nDuring the 1970s, three names emerged that would plant the seed for future generations of competition at Southside Speedway. Ray Hendrick, Cal Johnson and Ted Hairfield were older drivers whose sons and grandsons have become competitive forces throughout the decades.\n\n===The Hendricks===\n[[Ray Hendrick]] raced his burgundy Modified car during the 1960s and 1970s, and quickly planted the seed for the Hendrick dynasty. In 1974 and 1975, he placed 8th and 9th respectively in the National Late Model Sportsman Points, which would later become known as the [[Busch Grand National Series]].  At [[Martinsville Speedway]], Ray Hendrick is 1st in all-time wins after he won 20 collective races between 1963 and 1975. He sits atop this list of great drivers including [[Richard Petty]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. Ray Hendrick is best known for his philosophy of racing anywhere and everywhere. He participated in 17 NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] races, of which he captured six career top fives. Cancer claimed Ray Hendrick's life on September 28, 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Hendrick Career Statistics|url=http://racing-reference.info/driver/hendrra01|accessdate=18 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nLater down the road, his son Roy Hendrick would enter the Late Model Stock Car division in a Pontiac whose paint scheme would become identical to his father's modified car. These cars were burgundy, whose white number 11 was encased in a white circle with a wing coming from the side. Roy Hendrick also made a name for himself and neighboring short tracks that feature Late Model-type racing including [[Langley Speedway (Virginia)|Langley Speedway]] in Hampton, Virginia and [[South Boston Speedway]]. Roy Hendrick dominated Southside Speedway for years, because of which he is commonly referred to as \"Rapid\" Roy Hendrick.  Because of his and his father's reign at these tracks, the \"Flying Eleven\" logo has become as common among the Virginia short track circuit as [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s number three has become an iconic symbol among the NASCAR circuit.  Over the past few years, Roy's son, Brandon Hendrick has peeked his head into the Late Model Sportsman and Modified divisions. Brandon currently races the number 55 car in Southside Speedway's Late Model Sportsman division. Roy Hendrick currently races the number 39 car in the Late Model Sportsman division at Southside Speedway. Also Roy Hendrick has of late mentored a driver named Mark Simpson #36 driving a car in the Grand Stock division maintained by Roy and won in only his 6th race and has finished 2nd in points in 2009 and 3rd in 2010 and has numerous heat and feature wins and also won the 2008 Thanksgiving Classic at Southern National Speedway, in keeping with the Hendrick tradition.\n\n===The 1980s===\nDuring the mid to late 1980s, the three prominent divisions at Southside Speedway were the Late Model Stock Cars, Grand Stocks and Mini Stocks. The elite of Southside Speedway's limelight through the 1980s was shared by the rivalry between Wayne Patterson and Roy Hendrick, but Bugs Hairfield, Roger Sawyer, David Blankenship and Eddie Johnson was always in competition, and passed the track championship around throughout the decade. On Saturdays in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the track would often feature an [[enduro race]] that would include upwards of 80 cars racing in a 100-lap melee. These races were incredibly hard to keep up with, as the track was constantly completely congested with cars. The track would also feature a number of other divisions on certain occasions, including Modifieds, Pure Stocks, Factory Stocks, Go-Karts, and many others.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Southside Speedway created an Enduro-type division that would race every week with the rest of the Friday night racing activity. Originally, these cars were called Street Stocks, but the name was changed the next year or two years later to \"Southside Chargers.\"\n\nWayne Patterson lost his sponsorship with [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] during the late 1980s, giving way for Roy Hendrick to dominate the Late Model Stock Cars throughout the early 1990s. The battle for second was almost always fought between Bugs Hairfield, Eddie Johnson and Shayne Lockhart. This continued until Wayne Patterson made his return during the mid-1990s and resurged the Hendrick/Patterson rivalry. During the mid-1990s, Shayne Lockhart was the dominant force, and Eddie Johnson fell into the limelight during the late 1990s.\n\n===Denny Hamlin===\nIn the early 2000s, [[Denny Hamlin]] first started racing in the Mini Stock division at Southside Speedway in 1997. Within the next five years, he would see his share of wins and track records at Southside Speedway, as well as in neighboring tracks in Southampton, Langley and South Boston. After racing in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] and the Busch Series, Hamlin was signed by [[Joe Gibbs Racing]] and ran his first full-time [[Nextel Cup]] season in 2006. That year, he swept both races at [[Pocono International Raceway]], earned the Nextel Cup Rookie of the Year title, and qualified for the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. [[Curtis Markham]], former Southside Speedway track champion, is currently Hamlin's [[spotter (auto racing)|spotter]].\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Hamlin has hosted the Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown (previously known as the Denny Hamlin 175),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2008_Denny_Hamlin_175/X|title=2008 Denny Hamlin 175|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2009-11/X|title=2009 Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2010_Denny_Hamlin_Short_Track_Showdown/X|title=2010 Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> which later moved to [[Richmond International Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rir.com/Articles/2013/02/Denny-Hamlin-Short-Track-Showdown.aspx|title=Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown, Benefiting Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU, Returns to RIR, April 25|work=[[Richmond International Raceway]]|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\n===The Present===\nDuring the mid-2000s, Southside Speedway vastly expanded its horizons by offering up to eight divisions of racing. The two main attractions, the Late Model Sportsman division and the [[Modified racing|Modified]] division, typically alternate between their respected Friday nights. Chris Dodson was the 2007 track champion in the Late Model Sportsman division and Thomas Stinson was the 2007 Modified track Champion. To keep the three family traditions going, Brandon Hendrick and Chris Hairfield, grandsons of Ray Hendrick and Ted Hairfield and sons of Roy Hendrick and Bug's Hairfield, have become contenders in the Late Model Sportsman division. Chris Johnson, grandson of Cal Johnson and son of Eddie Johnson, also races the #36 car in the Modified division and won his first feature event on opening night of 2008. During the 2007 season the two feature divisions were dominated by Chris Dodson in the Late Model Sportsman division and Thomas Stinson in the Modified Division. Rudy was the only driver other than Stinson to win in the Modified division in 2007.\n\nIn 2008 that would change. The 7-car invert before each race has made winning a bigger challenge for Stinson, which has allowed other drivers such as Chris Johnson and Billy Morris to capture wins, but consistency still keeps Stinson in a generous points lead. Thomas Stinson has proven to be a class by himself. An unparalleled financial devotion to his car and race team has made him the obvious front-runner in the Modified division. In clean air, it is obvious to any spectator that Stinson's car is blatantly unmatched. Despite the 7-car invert and shortening modified races to 33 laps, current Modified events at Southside are often viewed as Stinson's struggle against the clock to gain the lead. It isn't a question of whether Stinson can gain the lead, rather a question of whether he has enough time. This is a contrast to the Late Model Sportsman division where, though many races may be decided upon qualifying, you never know who that driver will be walking into the gate. In the modified division, if Stinson's car is in the pit stall, chances are it'll be in victory lane. Since 2006, Stinson has won 48 out of 76 (63%) Modified events, including 9 out of 12 in 2007.\n\n==Current Racing Divisions==\n===Late Model Sportsman===\nThe Late Model Sportsman division essentially entails cars built for racing that are modeled after modern 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]]. The cars are typically badged as [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]s, [[Dodge Charger]]s, [[Toyota Camry]]s, or [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]]s, but are built ground-up for racing. Like cars featured in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, they are \"stock\" cars in theory. Aside from being shaped similar to the street model cars they represent, they are essentially fabricated and built identically, and for the sole purpose of stock car racing. Parts may be built by different manufacturers and may come from a differing manufacturing process, however the differences between the cars themselves are negligible. This is opposed to other divisions like Grand Stocks or Street Stocks in which actual street cars are gutted and fitted with the necessary modifications for the race track. It is a common misconception that the Late Model Stock Car division was renamed to Late Model Sportsman at some point. According to track ownership, the current Late Model Sportsman division is a result of the 2003 migration from the old Grand Stock division. Technically, the current Grand Stock division is a new division, and the Late Model Stock Cars are now defunct. The older Late Model Stock Cars were highly modified street cars, but the new Late Model Sportsman cars are actual racing cars with fabricated bodies and contain mostly racing parts. The current Late Model Sportsman division qualifies via time trials and runs features of 150 laps, 100 laps, 75 laps, or 50 laps.\n\n===Modifieds===\n\"[[Modifieds]]\" are open-wheel cars that behave similarly to the Late Model Sportsman cars. Most modern Modifieds are built as if they will be raced on dirt, and the suspension is designed to drift into turns on dirt tracks as opposed to \"sticking\" on pavement. Though modifications are made, Modifieds are typically harder to handle on the pavement, and are still driven to glide into turns as opposed to railing around them. The Modified class was the original feature class at Southside Speedway, though by comparison, the original Modifieds and the modern class of Modifieds have opposite theories. In the early days of short track racing, all stock cars were modified street cars. From there, further modifications would be necessary for them to qualify as a part of a \"Modified\" class. Today, since most premier stock car racing series' feature cars built specifically for their destined racing purpose, current Modifieds are built with the premise of becoming \"Modifieds.\" Thus, they are being used for their essential conceived purpose, and are \"modified\" in name-only. These cars, which are now one of the premier classes at Southside Speedway alternate with the Late Model Sportsman division, running every other Friday night. In past years they have run 100-lap features, but in 2008 they are only slated for one 100-lap feature, and most other nights they are scheduled to run twin 50-lap races.\n\n===Grand Stock===\nThe Grand Stock class as seen as the first level under the Late Model Sportsman and the Modifieds. While Southside Speedway has historically almost always had a Grand Stock division, this is seen as a \"new\" division as of a few years ago. This class is the more premier class of actual street cars. While the front-end may be customized, the rest of the body is mainly stock. Almost always 90% of a Grand Stock field will consist of the Monte Carlo of the late 1980s. The Grand Stock division runs 30-lap races and qualifies via 10-lap heat races.\n\n===U-Cars===\nThe U-Cars were debuted in 2003. While Southside Speedway features a karting division, the U-Cars are seen as the beginning class. U-Car is an acronym meaning \"U Can Afford to Race\", and encompasses American-made 4-cylinder cars. The U-Car race is seen as a \"new\" division, but is practically a recycled version of the Mini Stock class of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n===Street Stock===\nThe Street Stock division is the evolution of the old Enduro Races on Saturdays brought to Southside Speedway by Joe Kelly in the mid-80's. During the late 1980s, Southside began experimenting with an Enduro-type class on Friday nights by bringing the Factory Stocks to Southside once or twice a year. When the Enduro races became a Friday night feature at Southside, they were brought on as Street Stocks and eventually became the Southside Chargers. After the series was changed back to Street Stock for several years, they were disbanded for a few years. They were brought back in the mid-2000s, being known as the \"Enduro\" division and was meant as a no-holds-barred, anything-goes division. After the apparent need for some safety considerations were met, the Enduro cars were fitted with [[roll cage]]s, the rules were changed and the division became known as Street Stocks again.\n\n==Attendance==\nSouthside Speedway has gone through a roller coaster of variations in attendance over the years. At times, Southside Speedway has struggled and survived many years of near shut-down, and at other times Southside Speedway packs the stands every Friday night. During the early 1980s, attendance was an issue as the track found it difficult to find cars to race, and would often jump through hoops to provide extra incentive for fans to show up. Around this time, the track was condemned by [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]] because of serious safety hazards associated with the old wooden grandstands. The stands were upgraded in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|last=Page|first=Sara|title=At 50, Southside Speedway still emphasizes family ties|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/sports/motor_sports/article/SIDE23_20090722-231604/281646/|accessdate=18 May 2010|newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=23 July 2009}}</ref> In the late 1980s however, the track was fitted with newer aluminum grandstands that could hold twice as many fans and there was promise for a next generation to begin.\n\nDespite these changes, Southside Speedway was rumored to be replaced by a shopping mall in 1987-88.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Harold|title=Cox, Kelly Latest to Resurrect Southside Speedway |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/timesdispatch/access/616748061.html?dids=616748061:616748061&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+19,+1989&author=Harold+Pearson&pub=Richmond+Times+-+Dispatch&desc=COX,+KELLY+LATEST+TO+RESURRECT+SOUTHSIDE+SPEEDWAY&pqatl=google|accessdate=18 May 2010|newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 19, 1989}}</ref> There were even talks of building a new track to replace it in neighboring [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Southside Speedway To Be Replaced By Mall|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cu0QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LYwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=southside%20speedway&pg=3284%2C6417603|accessdate=18 May 2010|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=2 October 1987}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, there was talk of possibly lengthening the track, but ultimately the decision was made to keep it the way it was. When [[Denny Hamlin]] came from Southside and landed in the Sprint Cup series, fans all over Richmond who have jumped on the bandwagon have caused a resurgence of attendance at Southside. In 2007, Denny Hamlin came to Southside on a Thursday night on the week of the May Sprint Cup race at [[Richmond International Raceway]] and Southside saw the best attendance it had seen in years. The following year, Denny Hamlin brought Joe Gibbs teammate [[Kyle Busch]] to the track to race in a special 175-lap Late Model Sportsman event to benefit the newly founded Denny Hamlin Foundation. Kyle Busch won that race after Denny Hamlin was sent to the rear of the field early in the event after an incident involving Billy Morris. The race put Southside Speedway in the national spotlight as the event was talked about that weekend during coverage of racing, qualifying and practice for the ensuing races at [[Richmond International Raceway|RIR]] on Speed and FOX.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.southsidespeedway.com Official Website of Southside Speedway]\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks?id=155 Southside Speedway historic race results] at Racing-Reference\n\n{{NASCAR Cup Series racetracks}}\n{{ISCARS Dash racetracks}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Richmond, Virginia]]\n[[Category:NASCAR tracks]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Motorsport track in the United States}}\n{{tone|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox motorsport venue\n|name             = Southside Speedway\n|nicknames        = The Toughest Short Track in the South\n|time             =\n|location         = [[Midlothian, Virginia]]\n|coordinates      = {{coords|37.450929|-77.629130|display=inline,title}}\n|image            = TaylorMeyn 04-30-2009 SouthsideSpeeway PreRace.jpg\n|image_caption    = Pre Race ceremonies for a 2009 Denny Hamlin Charity event benefiting the [[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]].\n|capacity         = ~6,000\n|FIA_grade        =\n|owner            = J.M.

Usually, the more prominent division has been any variety of [[late model]] cars or modifieds, and its immediate predecessor division has been the Grand Stock class, or something similar, such as Pure Stocks.\n\nDuring the 1970s, three names emerged that would plant the seed for future generations of competition at Southside Speedway. Ray Hendrick, Cal Johnson and Ted Hairfield were older drivers whose sons and grandsons have become competitive forces throughout the decades.\n\n===The Hendricks===\n[[Ray Hendrick]] raced his burgundy Modified car during the 1960s and 1970s, and quickly planted the seed for the Hendrick dynasty. In 1974 and 1975, he placed 8th and 9th respectively in the National Late Model Sportsman Points, which would later become known as the [[Busch Grand National Series]].  At [[Martinsville Speedway]], Ray Hendrick is 1st in all-time wins after he won 20 collective races between 1963 and 1975. He sits atop this list of great drivers including [[Richard Petty]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. Ray Hendrick is best known for his philosophy of racing anywhere and everywhere. He participated in 17 NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] races, of which he captured six career top fives. Cancer claimed Ray Hendrick's life on September 28, 1990.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Hendrick Career Statistics|url=http://racing-reference.info/driver/hendrra01|accessdate=18 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nLater down the road, his son Roy Hendrick would enter the Late Model Stock Car division in a Pontiac whose paint scheme would become identical to his father's modified car. These cars were burgundy, whose white number 11 was encased in a white circle with a wing coming from the side. Roy Hendrick also made a name for himself and neighboring short tracks that feature Late Model-type racing including [[Langley Speedway (Virginia)|Langley Speedway]] in Hampton, Virginia and [[South Boston Speedway]]. Roy Hendrick dominated Southside Speedway for years, because of which he is commonly referred to as \"Rapid\" Roy Hendrick.  Because of his and his father's reign at these tracks, the \"Flying Eleven\" logo has become as common among the Virginia short track circuit as [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s number three has become an iconic symbol among the NASCAR circuit.  Over the past few years, Roy's son, Brandon Hendrick has peeked his head into the Late Model Sportsman and Modified divisions. Brandon currently races the number 55 car in Southside Speedway's Late Model Sportsman division. Roy Hendrick currently races the number 39 car in the Late Model Sportsman division at Southside Speedway. Also Roy Hendrick has of late mentored a driver named Mark Simpson #36 driving a car in the Grand Stock division maintained by Roy and won in only his 6th race and has finished 2nd in points in 2009 and 3rd in 2010 and has numerous heat and feature wins and also won the 2008 Thanksgiving Classic at Southern National Speedway, in keeping with the Hendrick tradition.\n\n===The 1980s===\nDuring the mid to late 1980s, the three prominent divisions at Southside Speedway were the Late Model Stock Cars, Grand Stocks and Mini Stocks. The elite of Southside Speedway's limelight through the 1980s was shared by the rivalry between Wayne Patterson and Roy Hendrick, but Bugs Hairfield, Roger Sawyer, David Blankenship and Eddie Johnson was always in competition, and passed the track championship around throughout the decade. On Saturdays in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the track would often feature an [[enduro race]] that would include upwards of 80 cars racing in a 100-lap melee. These races were incredibly hard to keep up with, as the track was constantly completely congested with cars. The track would also feature a number of other divisions on certain occasions, including Modifieds, Pure Stocks, Factory Stocks, Go-Karts, and many others.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Southside Speedway created an Enduro-type division that would race every week with the rest of the Friday night racing activity. Originally, these cars were called Street Stocks, but the name was changed the next year or two years later to \"Southside Chargers.\"\n\nWayne Patterson lost his sponsorship with [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] during the late 1980s, giving way for Roy Hendrick to dominate the Late Model Stock Cars throughout the early 1990s. The battle for second was almost always fought between Bugs Hairfield, Eddie Johnson and Shayne Lockhart. This continued until Wayne Patterson made his return during the mid-1990s and resurged the Hendrick/Patterson rivalry. During the mid-1990s, Shayne Lockhart was the dominant force, and Eddie Johnson fell into the limelight during the late 1990s.\n\n===Denny Hamlin===\nIn the early 2000s, [[Denny Hamlin]] first started racing in the Mini Stock division at Southside Speedway in 1997. Within the next five years, he would see his share of wins and track records at Southside Speedway, as well as in neighboring tracks in Southampton, Langley and South Boston. After racing in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] and the Busch Series, Hamlin was signed by [[Joe Gibbs Racing]] and ran his first full-time [[Nextel Cup]] season in 2006. That year, he swept both races at [[Pocono International Raceway]], earned the Nextel Cup Rookie of the Year title, and qualified for the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup]]. [[Curtis Markham]], former Southside Speedway track champion, is currently Hamlin's [[spotter (auto racing)|spotter]].\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Hamlin has hosted the Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown (previously known as the Denny Hamlin 175),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2008_Denny_Hamlin_175/X|title=2008 Denny Hamlin 175|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2009-11/X|title=2009 Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2010_Denny_Hamlin_Short_Track_Showdown/X|title=2010 Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> which later moved to [[Richmond International Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rir.com/Articles/2013/02/Denny-Hamlin-Short-Track-Showdown.aspx|title=Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown, Benefiting Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU, Returns to RIR, April 25|work=[[Richmond International Raceway]]|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\n===The Present===\nDuring the mid-2000s, Southside Speedway vastly expanded its horizons by offering up to eight divisions of racing. The two main attractions, the Late Model Sportsman division and the [[Modified racing|Modified]] division, typically alternate between their respected Friday nights. Chris Dodson was the 2007 track champion in the Late Model Sportsman division and Thomas Stinson was the 2007 Modified track Champion. To keep the three family traditions going, Brandon Hendrick and Chris Hairfield, grandsons of Ray Hendrick and Ted Hairfield and sons of Roy Hendrick and Bug's Hairfield, have become contenders in the Late Model Sportsman division. Chris Johnson, grandson of Cal Johnson and son of Eddie Johnson, also races the #36 car in the Modified division and won his first feature event on opening night of 2008. During the 2007 season the two feature divisions were dominated by Chris Dodson in the Late Model Sportsman division and Thomas Stinson in the Modified Division. Rudy was the only driver other than Stinson to win in the Modified division in 2007.\n\nIn 2008 that would change. The 7-car invert before each race has made winning a bigger challenge for Stinson, which has allowed other drivers such as Chris Johnson and Billy Morris to capture wins, but consistency still keeps Stinson in a generous points lead. Thomas Stinson has proven to be a class by himself. An unparalleled financial devotion to his car and race team has made him the obvious front-runner in the Modified division. In clean air, it is obvious to any spectator that Stinson's car is blatantly unmatched. Despite the 7-car invert and shortening modified races to 33 laps, current Modified events at Southside are often viewed as Stinson's struggle against the clock to gain the lead. It isn't a question of whether Stinson can gain the lead, rather a question of whether he has enough time. This is a contrast to the Late Model Sportsman division where, though many races may be decided upon qualifying, you never know who that driver will be walking into the gate. In the modified division, if Stinson's car is in the pit stall, chances are it'll be in victory lane. Since 2006, Stinson has won 48 out of 76 (63%) Modified events, including 9 out of 12 in 2007.\n\n==Current Racing Divisions==\n===Late Model Sportsman===\nThe Late Model Sportsman division essentially entails cars built for racing that are modeled after modern 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]]. The cars are typically badged as [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]s, [[Dodge Charger]]s, [[Toyota Camry]]s, or [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]]s, but are built ground-up for racing. Like cars featured in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, they are \"stock\" cars in theory. Aside from being shaped similar to the street model cars they represent, they are essentially fabricated and built identically, and for the sole purpose of stock car racing. Parts may be built by different manufacturers and may come from a differing manufacturing process, however the differences between the cars themselves are negligible. This is opposed to other divisions like Grand Stocks or Street Stocks in which actual street cars are gutted and fitted with the necessary modifications for the race track. It is a common misconception that the Late Model Stock Car division was renamed to Late Model Sportsman at some point. According to track ownership, the current Late Model Sportsman division is a result of the 2003 migration from the old Grand Stock division. Technically, the current Grand Stock division is a new division, and the Late Model Stock Cars are now defunct. The older Late Model Stock Cars were highly modified street cars, but the new Late Model Sportsman cars are actual racing cars with fabricated bodies and contain mostly racing parts. The current Late Model Sportsman division qualifies via time trials and runs features of 150 laps, 100 laps, 75 laps, or 50 laps.\n\n===Modifieds===\n\"[[Modifieds]]\" are open-wheel cars that behave similarly to the Late Model Sportsman cars. Most modern Modifieds are built as if they will be raced on dirt, and the suspension is designed to drift into turns on dirt tracks as opposed to \"sticking\" on pavement. Though modifications are made, Modifieds are typically harder to handle on the pavement, and are still driven to glide into turns as opposed to railing around them. The Modified class was the original feature class at Southside Speedway, though by comparison, the original Modifieds and the modern class of Modifieds have opposite theories. In the early days of short track racing, all stock cars were modified street cars. From there, further modifications would be necessary for them to qualify as a part of a \"Modified\" class. Today, since most premier stock car racing series' feature cars built specifically for their destined racing purpose, current Modifieds are built with the premise of becoming \"Modifieds.\" Thus, they are being used for their essential conceived purpose, and are \"modified\" in name-only. These cars, which are now one of the premier classes at Southside Speedway alternate with the Late Model Sportsman division, running every other Friday night. In past years they have run 100-lap features, but in 2008 they are only slated for one 100-lap feature, and most other nights they are scheduled to run twin 50-lap races.\n\n===Grand Stock===\nThe Grand Stock class as seen as the first level under the Late Model Sportsman and the Modifieds. While Southside Speedway has historically almost always had a Grand Stock division, this is seen as a \"new\" division as of a few years ago. This class is the more premier class of actual street cars. While the front-end may be customized, the rest of the body is mainly stock. Almost always 90% of a Grand Stock field will consist of the Monte Carlo of the late 1980s. The Grand Stock division runs 30-lap races and qualifies via 10-lap heat races.\n\n===U-Cars===\nThe U-Cars were debuted in 2003. While Southside Speedway features a karting division, the U-Cars are seen as the beginning class. U-Car is an acronym meaning \"U Can Afford to Race\", and encompasses American-made 4-cylinder cars. The U-Car race is seen as a \"new\" division, but is practically a recycled version of the Mini Stock class of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n===Street Stock===\nThe Street Stock division is the evolution of the old Enduro Races on Saturdays brought to Southside Speedway by Joe Kelly in the mid-80's. During the late 1980s, Southside began experimenting with an Enduro-type class on Friday nights by bringing the Factory Stocks to Southside once or twice a year. When the Enduro races became a Friday night feature at Southside, they were brought on as Street Stocks and eventually became the Southside Chargers. After the series was changed back to Street Stock for several years, they were disbanded for a few years. They were brought back in the mid-2000s, being known as the \"Enduro\" division and was meant as a no-holds-barred, anything-goes division. After the apparent need for some safety considerations were met, the Enduro cars were fitted with [[roll cage]]s, the rules were changed and the division became known as Street Stocks again.\n\n==Attendance==\nSouthside Speedway has gone through a roller coaster of variations in attendance over the years. At times, Southside Speedway has struggled and survived many years of near shut-down, and at other times Southside Speedway packs the stands every Friday night. During the early 1980s, attendance was an issue as the track found it difficult to find cars to race, and would often jump through hoops to provide extra incentive for fans to show up. Around this time, the track was condemned by [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]] because of serious safety hazards associated with the old wooden grandstands. The stands were upgraded in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|last=Page|first=Sara|title=At 50, Southside Speedway still emphasizes family ties|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/sports/motor_sports/article/SIDE23_20090722-231604/281646/|accessdate=18 May 2010|newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=23 July 2009}}</ref> In the late 1980s however, the track was fitted with newer aluminum grandstands that could hold twice as many fans and there was promise for a next generation to begin.\n\nDespite these changes, Southside Speedway was rumored to be replaced by a shopping mall in 1987-88.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Harold|title=Cox, Kelly Latest to Resurrect Southside Speedway |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/timesdispatch/access/616748061.html?dids=616748061:616748061&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+19,+1989&author=Harold+Pearson&pub=Richmond+Times+-+Dispatch&desc=COX,+KELLY+LATEST+TO+RESURRECT+SOUTHSIDE+SPEEDWAY&pqatl=google|accessdate=18 May 2010|newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 19, 1989}}</ref> There were even talks of building a new track to replace it in neighboring [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Southside Speedway To Be Replaced By Mall|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cu0QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LYwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=southside%20speedway&pg=3284%2C6417603|accessdate=18 May 2010|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=2 October 1987}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, there was talk of possibly lengthening the track, but ultimately the decision was made to keep it the way it was. When [[Denny Hamlin]] came from Southside and landed in the Sprint Cup series, fans all over Richmond who have jumped on the bandwagon have caused a resurgence of attendance at Southside. In 2007, Denny Hamlin came to Southside on a Thursday night on the week of the May Sprint Cup race at [[Richmond International Raceway]] and Southside saw the best attendance it had seen in years. The following year, Denny Hamlin brought Joe Gibbs teammate [[Kyle Busch]] to the track to race in a special 175-lap Late Model Sportsman event to benefit the newly founded Denny Hamlin Foundation. Kyle Busch won that race after Denny Hamlin was sent to the rear of the field early in the event after an incident involving Billy Morris. The race put Southside Speedway in the national spotlight as the event was talked about that weekend during coverage of racing, qualifying and practice for the ensuing races at [[Richmond International Raceway|RIR]] on Speed and FOX.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.southsidespeedway.com Official Website of Southside Speedway]\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks?id=155 Historic NASCAR results of Southside Speedway]\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Richmond, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Chesterfield County, Virginia]]\n", "name_user": "Luks25", "label": "safe", "comment": "Update", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southside_Speedway"}

On the same day, the Fourth Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Henderson, DSO, was nominated as the Training Battalion of the Group. On 1 December the same year it was renamed as the 10/18th Royal Garhw\u00e1l Rifles. Even today, veterans colloquially refer to the Regiment as Garhwal Group.\n\nOn 2 February 1921, on the occasion of laying of the foundation stone of the All India War Memorial at Delhi, the Duke of Connaught announced that in recognition of the distinguished services and gallantry, the Emperor had conferred the title of \u2018Royal\u2019 to six units and two Regiments, of which the Regiment was one. The \u2018Royal\u2019 Garhw\u00e1l Rifles was sanctioned the special distinguishing mark of wearing a scarlet twisted red cord(royal rassi) on the right shoulder and the Tudor crown on its shoulder title. The title \u2018Royal\u2019 and the crown have been dropped on 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, however the lanyard retains its pride of place.\n\n==Refusal to undertake anti-riot duty in Peshawar<ref name=\":5\" />==\nDuring disturbances in Peshawar in 1930 two platoons of the Royal Garhwal Rifles refused to board buses that would have taken them into the city to contain widespread rioting.

An 11th (Territorial) Battalion had been raised in Peshawar in 1939 for line of communication protection duties; the 6th Battalion was raised from this in 1941.\n\nWorld War II saw active participation of the Garhwalis, the 1st and 4th Battalions in Burma, the 2nd and 5th Battalions seeing action in Malaya. The 2nd Battalion was the Garrison Battalion at [[Kuantan]] in the Malay Peninsula in 1940. The only infantry battalion in Kuantan, it was put to a myriad of tasks in a widely dispersed area. Just before the Japanese offensive, it had been milked twice to assist forming new battalions. When the Japanese struck, the battalion fought gallantly, inflicting heavy casualties. The battlion was awarded Battle Honour \u2018Kuantan\u2019 and Theatre Honour \u2018Malaya 1941-42\u2019. The 2nd Battalion ceased to exist after the Malayan Campaign due to heavy casualties \u2013 the remnants captured by the Japanese. The newly raised 5th Battalion was ordered overseas in Dec 1941 while still raw and under-equipped. It sailed for the Middle East, however the destination was changed after it embarked to [[Singapore]]. The battalion fought some notable actions at [[Muar District|Muar]], [[Johor]] and then the long, bitter rearguard action to Singapore. The 7th Battalion was raised essentially as a replacement for these two battalions (later converted to a training role). It was only after the War in 1946 that the 2nd Battalion was re-raised. The 5th had to wait till 1962 for its re-raising.\n\nThe 1st Battalion moved to Burma in 1941 and fought valiantly in the effort to stem the Japanese tide. It took part in the desperate fighting in the southern Shan states at Yenangyuang, which it was awarded as a Battle Honour. It also has the distinction of being the only awardee of Battle Honour \"Monywa\", the last major action in the Retreat from Burma. After a period of rest and regrouping followed by intensive jungle training, the battalion was back for the Reconquest of Burma. Its actions in [[Arakan Mountains|Arakan]], Ngyakydauk Pass, the landings at Ramree, and the final entry into Rangoon won it more Battle Honours :  \"North Arakan\", \"Ngakyduak Pass\", \"Ramree\" and \"Tuangup\", and Theatre Honour \"Burma 1942-45\".\n\nThe 4th Battalion, too, was ordered to Burma after nearly three years on the NW Frontier. After intensive jungle warfare training, it moved to Burma and fought a series of actions in the Tunnels Area, Akyab and then the mopping up operations at Ruywa before proceeding to Kuala Lumpur for disarming the Japanese who had capitulated.\n\nNorth Africa and Italy. The 3rd Battalion served in [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], the Western Desert, [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and finally in the Campaign in [[Italy]]. In Abyssinia, in the opening stages of WWII, it blazed a trail against the Italians, distinguishing itself in the entire campaign. Among its Battle Honours earned are three \u2018Garhwali-only\u2019 honours :  \"Gallabat\", \"Barentu\" and \"Massawa\". More Battle Honours followed : \"Keren\", \"Amba Alagi\", \"Citta di Castello\", and Theatre Honours \"North Africa 1940-43\" and \"Italy 1943-45\", bearing testimony to Garhwali valour in diverse battlefields and theatres.\n\nThe end of the War and consequent demobilisation left the regiment with three regular battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Thus, at Independence, the Garhwal Rifles had only three active battalions.\n\n==Post Independence==\nAfter the formation of India in 1947 and the subsequent merger of the various states in India at the time, the [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal Princely State]] was among the first to be merged in with the [[Indian Union]]. Subsequently, the Regiment was transferred to the newly independent [[Indian Army]]. The 3rd Battalion participated with distinction in the J&K Operations, winning Battle Honour \"Tithwal\" and gaining the distinction of becoming one of the most decorated battalions of the Indian Army in any one operation after independence \u2013 it won one MVC, 18 VrCs, 01 SC (then referred to as the Ashoka Chakra Class III) and 19 Mentions-in-Despatches. The Commanding Officer Lt Col Kaman Singh was awarded a well deserved Maha Vir Chakra and his name lives on in the form of the \u2018Kaman Setu\u2019, the crossing point recently opened up between PoK and J&K (now renamed the \u2018Aman Kaman Setu\u2019).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1950, the Royal title was dropped from the Regiment's name when India became a Republic. Other regimental symbols that were associated with the British were also discontinued, although the regimental lanyard continued to be worn on the right shoulder in traditional 'Royal' fashion.<ref name=Sharma254>Sharma, p. 254</ref> In 1953, the Regiment's 3rd Battalion contributed to the United Nations custodian force in Korea.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031030/ncr.htm The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - National Capital Region<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Indo-China War of 1962==\nThe 1962 Sino-Indian Conflict saw the 4th Battalion in the midst of heavy fighting in Tawang, Jang and Nuranang, where it gave an excellent account of itself, suffering very heavy casualties. The battalion's stand at Nuranang has been singled out in most accounts of the war as a '''\"fine example of infantry battle\"'''. For its brave stand against overwhelming odds, 4 GARH RIF was awarded the Battle Honour \"Nuranang\" \u2013 the only battalion to be awarded a battle honour in NEFA, a singular distinction in the context of that particular conflict. Nuranang has since been renamed Jaswantgarh, in honour of Rfn [[Jaswant Singh Rawat]] whose bravery at  Nuranang merited a posthumous Maha Vir Chakra. The other Maha Vir Chakra won in this conflict was won by Lt Col (later Maj Gen) BM Bhattacharjea, the indefatigable Commanding Officer under whose leadership the 4th  Battalion gave a bloody nose to the Chinese. In captivity, the survivors of the battalion were singled out for extra punishment in the Chinese PoW camp as retaliation for the heavy casualties the Chinese had suffered at the hands of the Garhwalis.\n\n==Indo-Pakistan War of 1965==\nIn 1965, the First Battalion fought at Gadra Road, the Second Battalion at OP Hill, the Sixth Battalion at Phillora and the Eighth Battalion at Butur Dograndi, where it lost two senior Officers viz Lt Col JE Jhirad and Major AR Khan within two days. The command then fell on to youngest captain (Lt Col) HS Rautela who lead by front and got gallantry commendation by then Chief of Army Staff. Captain CN Singh of the Regiment was posthumously awarded the MVC for gallantry whilst serving in HQ 120 Infantry Brigade. First Battalion and Eighth Battalion were honoured with battle honours \u2018GADRA ROAD\u2019 and \u2018BUTUR DOGRANDI\u2019 respectively. The Sixth Battalion was awarded the battle honour \u2018PHILLORA\u2019.\n\n'''Battle of Gadra City'''\nThe 1st Battalion was in the Rajasthan sector and distinguished itself in operations to take Gadra City, giving a fine display of infantry tactics in desert terrain without artillery support. The battalion went on to capture Jesse ke Par, Nawa Tala and Miajlar. Among those awarded the Vir Chakra was the CO Lt Col KP Lahiri. The Battalion won Battle Honour \u2018Gadra Road\u2019 and Theatre Honour \u2018Rajasthan 1965\u2019. Captain Narsingh bahadur Singh played an important role and for his gallantry and courageous efforts he was awarded with 'sena medal'.\n\n'''Operation Hill'''\nThe 2nd Battalion participated in the two assaults on \u2018OP Hill\u2019. Capt Chandra Narain Singh of the 2nd Battalion was attached to HQ 120 Infantry Brigade. In a gallant night action against raiders in the Galuthi area, he led the charge that killed six of the enemy while the rest fled, leaving behind large quantities of arms, ammunition and equipment. Capt CN Singh was hit by a machine gun burst in this action and laid down his life. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was in the Lahore sector, and participated in the advance up the GT Road. It suffered 33 killed, mostly due to very heavy enemy artillery fire. The 6th Battalion was in Sialkot where some of the fiercest fighting of the war took place. In the initial phase, the battalion took Charwa. It then held on doggedly to Phillaura, beating back several enemy attacks. The 8th Battalion was also in the Sialkot sector, and fought the bitterly contested battle of Buttur Dograndi, paying a heavy price including losing the Commanding Officer and the 2IC within a span of two days of heavy fighting. These actions brought more glory to the regiment by way of Battle Honour \"Buttur Dograndi\" and the Theatre Honour \"Punjab 1965\".\n\n==1971 War==\n[[File:A Garhwal Rifles recruit in the 1970s.jpg|thumb|right|Garhwal Rifles Recruit 1970s.]]\nThe 5th Battalion blazed a glorious trail during operations for the Liberation of Bangladesh. For its actions in the war, the battalion was awarded Battle Honour \u2018Hilli\u2019 and Theatre Honour \u2018East Pakistan 1971\u2019. The battalion won three Vir Chakras. The 12th Battalion had been in action since October 1971 and on commencement of active hostilities, took Hatibandha and participated in operations east of Dinajpur.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was in the Shakargarh sector. It took its initial objectives Dhandar and Mukhwal (south of Suchetgarh) and then into enemy territory to Bair Kalan. By the time of the ceasefire, the battalion had penetrated up to Ramri, north of Chakra. The 4th Battalion was in the Jhangar sector and conducted raids on enemy outposts while holding its own ground. The 6th Battalion was in the Sialkot sector. After re-taking Nawanpind, the battalion carried the defensive battle into enemy territory, mounting three strong raids on enemy posts opposite its area. The 7th Battalion was in the Chhamb sector, fighting a series of actions culminating in the re-capture of Sangram post by the time the ceasefire  was declared.\n\nThe 8th Battalion under the command of Maj H.S Rautela S.M.(now Ltcol) was also in a holding role in Punjab and captured enemy post Ghurki. In his honor the Gurki Village name was changed to Harish Nagar and was awarded the Sena Medal. They kept holding this post despite shelling that continued till the ceasefire.\n\nThe 10th Battalion fought a notable action led by Maj Mahabir Negi while capturing Raipur Crossing in the Akhnur-Jaurian sector. The Commanding Officer Lt Col Onkar Singh personally led one of the attacks, being critically wounded and later succumbing to his injuries.\n\n==Kargil War==\n[[File:18 Garhwal Riles Point 4700.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of 18th Battalion before assault on Point 4700]]\nThe 17th Battalion was in the Batalik sub-sector and was tasked with assaulting Area Bump and Kalapathar in the Jubar Heights, a ridgeline overlooking Jubar top, astride the National Highway. The climb was arduous and all companies were \u2018daylighted\u2019 except for Capt Jintu Gogoi's platoon. The gallant \u2018Bhullas\u2019 took Kalapathar in the face of heavy enemy fire, and then came face to face with an enemy UMG emplacement. To the enemy's total surprise, Capt Gogoi launched an immediate attack on the UMG sangar, killing two intruders in hand-to-hand combat, being mortally wounded in the process. Capt Jintu Gogoi was awarded the Vir Chakra posthumously for his bravery in utter disregard for his own safety, but sadly his name is not much known between the people like Captain Vikram Batra, who was also a Kargil martyr. The battalion launched fresh attacks in the subsequent days and took Bump and Kalapathar. This paved the way for further successes \u2013 the battalion proceeded to take another dominating feature in the Muntho Dhalo complex, finally taking Point 5285 despite heavy snowfall and effective enemy fire including artillery fire due to the proximity of this feature to the LOC. The battalion was awarded Battle Honour \u2018Batalik\u2019 for its exploits in Op Vijay.\n\nThe 18th Battalion was tasked to take Point 4700 and the surrounding heights where the enemy had consolidated their positions after being evicted from Tololing and Point 5140. In the subsequent operations, the Bhullas displayed gallantry of the highest order. Capt Sumeet Roy led a daredevil attack, climbing a sheer escarpment and taking the enemy sangar by surprise. His breakthrough paved the way for capture of Pt 4700. This brave officer was later mortally wounded by enemy fire on the objective and succumbed to his injuries. Capt Sumeet Roy was awarded the Vir Chakra posthumously. The adjoining features were assaulted by other companies of the 18th. Maj Rajesh Sah and Capt MV Sooraj led from the front, evicting the enemy from many a stronghold. Both these gallant officers were awarded the Vir Chakra for courageous leadership and bravery. The Bhullas of the 18th Battalion displayed indomitable courage, Nk Kashmir Singh, Rfn Anusuya Prasad and Rfn Kuldeep Singh all won the Vir Chakra posthumously. The battalion received an immediate award of the COAS\u2019 Unit Citation, in all winning six Vir Chakras, a Bar to the Sena Medal, seven Sena Medals and the Battle Honour \u2018Dras\u2019.\n\nBoth Battalions were awarded Theatre Honour \u2018Kargil\u2019. These honours came at a high price, the regiment lost 49 personnel of all ranks killed in action.\n\n==Units of The Regiment<ref name=\":1\" />==\n*1st Battalion (Converted to 6 Mech Inf)\n*2nd Battalion  (Victoria Cross Paltan, Neuve Chapelle, Superb Seconds)\n*3rd Battalion (TITHWAL or The Third)\n*4th Battalion (Nuranang Battalion)\n*5th Battalion (HILLI)\n*6th Battalion\n*7th Battalion\n*8th Battalion\n*9th Battalion\n*10th Battalion\n*11th Battalion\n*12th Battalion\n*13th Battalion\n*14th Battalion\n*15th Battalion\n*16th Battalion\n*17th Battalion (Batalik Kargil )\n*18th Battalion (Dras Battalion)\n*19th Battalion\n*20th Battalion\n*21st Battalion\n*22nd Battalion\n*121 Infantry  Battalion Territorial Army (Garhwal) Indian Army Reserve : Kolkata , West Bengal\n*127 Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (Garhwal ECO) Indian Army Reserve , Dehradun , Uttarakhand\n*Garhwal Scouts(Scout Battalion)\n* 14 Rashtriya Rifles(GARH RIF)\n* 36 Rashtriya Rifles(GARH RIF) The Gallants or The Gallant 36\n* 48 Rashtriya Rifles(GARH RIF)\n\n<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Battle and Theatre Honours==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nAs on date the Regiment has earned 30 [[battle honours]].

Now 1 October is celebrated as the raising day of the battalion. After Independence, the name of the centre was changed to Garhwal Rifles Regimental Centre. The rigorous drills during the training helps to infuse a sense of discipline in every recruit. Special emphasis is laid on physical fitness, mental toughness and weapon handling. After successful completion of the 34-week training course, a Garhwali youth is turned into a soldier.

On the same day, the Fourth Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Henderson, DSO, was nominated as the Training Battalion of the Group. On 1 December the same year it was renamed as the 10/18th Royal Garhw\u00e1l Rifles. Even today, veterans colloquially refer to the Regiment as Garhwal Group.\n\nOn 2 February 1921, on the occasion of laying of the foundation stone of the All India War Memorial at Delhi, the Duke of Connaught announced that in recognition of the distinguished services and gallantry, the Emperor had conferred the title of \u2018Royal\u2019 to six units and two Regiments, of which the Regiment was one. The \u2018Royal\u2019 Garhw\u00e1l Rifles was sanctioned the special distinguishing mark of wearing a scarlet twisted red cord(royal rassi) on the right shoulder and the Tudor crown on its shoulder title. The title \u2018Royal\u2019 and the crown have been dropped on 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, however the lanyard retains its pride of place.\n\n==Refusal to undertake anti-riot duty in Peshawar<ref name=\":5\" />==\nDuring disturbances in Peshawar in 1930 two platoons of the Royal Garhwal Rifles refused to board buses that would have taken them into the city to contain widespread rioting.

An 11th (Territorial) Battalion had been raised in Peshawar in 1939 for line of communication protection duties; the 6th Battalion was raised from this in 1941.\n\nWorld War II saw active participation of the Garhwalis, the 1st and 4th Battalions in Burma, the 2nd and 5th Battalions seeing action in Malaya. The 2nd Battalion was the Garrison Battalion at [[Kuantan]] in the Malay Peninsula in 1940. The only infantry battalion in Kuantan, it was put to a myriad of tasks in a widely dispersed area. Just before the Japanese offensive, it had been milked twice to assist forming new battalions. When the Japanese struck, the battalion fought gallantly, inflicting heavy casualties. The battlion was awarded Battle Honour \u2018Kuantan\u2019 and Theatre Honour \u2018Malaya 1941-42\u2019. The 2nd Battalion ceased to exist after the Malayan Campaign due to heavy casualties \u2013 the remnants captured by the Japanese. The newly raised 5th Battalion was ordered overseas in Dec 1941 while still raw and under-equipped. It sailed for the Middle East, however the destination was changed after it embarked to [[Singapore]]. The battalion fought some notable actions at [[Muar District|Muar]], [[Johor]] and then the long, bitter rearguard action to Singapore. The 7th Battalion was raised essentially as a replacement for these two battalions (later converted to a training role). It was only after the War in 1946 that the 2nd Battalion was re-raised. The 5th had to wait till 1962 for its re-raising.\n\nThe 1st Battalion moved to Burma in 1941 and fought valiantly in the effort to stem the Japanese tide. It took part in the desperate fighting in the southern Shan states at Yenangyuang, which it was awarded as a Battle Honour. It also has the distinction of being the only awardee of Battle Honour \"Monywa\", the last major action in the Retreat from Burma. After a period of rest and regrouping followed by intensive jungle training, the battalion was back for the Reconquest of Burma. Its actions in [[Arakan Mountains|Arakan]], Ngyakydauk Pass, the landings at Ramree, and the final entry into Rangoon won it more Battle Honours :  \"North Arakan\", \"Ngakyduak Pass\", \"Ramree\" and \"Tuangup\", and Theatre Honour \"Burma 1942-45\".\n\nThe 4th Battalion, too, was ordered to Burma after nearly three years on the NW Frontier. After intensive jungle warfare training, it moved to Burma and fought a series of actions in the Tunnels Area, Akyab and then the mopping up operations at Ruywa before proceeding to Kuala Lumpur for disarming the Japanese who had capitulated.\n\nNorth Africa and Italy. The 3rd Battalion served in [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], the Western Desert, [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and finally in the Campaign in [[Italy]]. In Abyssinia, in the opening stages of WWII, it blazed a trail against the Italians, distinguishing itself in the entire campaign. Among its Battle Honours earned are three \u2018Garhwali-only\u2019 honours :  \"Gallabat\", \"Barentu\" and \"Massawa\". More Battle Honours followed : \"Keren\", \"Amba Alagi\", \"Citta di Castello\", and Theatre Honours \"North Africa 1940-43\" and \"Italy 1943-45\", bearing testimony to Garhwali valour in diverse battlefields and theatres.\n\nThe end of the War and consequent demobilisation left the regiment with three regular battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Thus, at Independence, the Garhwal Rifles had only three active battalions.\n\n==Post Independence==\nAfter the formation of India in 1947 and the subsequent merger of the various states in India at the time, the [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal Princely State]] was among the first to be merged in with the [[Indian Union]]. Subsequently, the Regiment was transferred to the newly independent [[Indian Army]]. The 3rd Battalion participated with distinction in the J&K Operations, winning Battle Honour \"Tithwal\" and gaining the distinction of becoming one of the most decorated battalions of the Indian Army in any one operation after independence \u2013 it won one MVC, 18 VrCs, 01 SC (then referred to as the Ashoka Chakra Class III) and 19 Mentions-in-Despatches. The Commanding Officer Lt Col Kaman Singh was awarded a well deserved Maha Vir Chakra and his name lives on in the form of the \u2018Kaman Setu\u2019, the crossing point recently opened up between PoK and J&K (now renamed the \u2018Aman Kaman Setu\u2019).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1950, the Royal title was dropped from the Regiment's name when India became a Republic. Other regimental symbols that were associated with the British were also discontinued, although the regimental lanyard continued to be worn on the right shoulder in traditional 'Royal' fashion.<ref name=Sharma254>Sharma, p. 254</ref> In 1953, the Regiment's 3rd Battalion contributed to the United Nations custodian force in Korea.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031030/ncr.htm The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - National Capital Region<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Indo-China War of 1962==\nThe 1962 Sino-Indian Conflict saw the 4th Battalion in the midst of heavy fighting in Tawang, Jang and Nuranang, where it gave an excellent account of itself, suffering very heavy casualties. The battalion's stand at Nuranang has been singled out in most accounts of the war as a '''\"fine example of infantry battle\"'''. For its brave stand against overwhelming odds, 4 GARH RIF was awarded the Battle Honour \"Nuranang\" \u2013 the only battalion to be awarded a battle honour in NEFA, a singular distinction in the context of that particular conflict. Nuranang has since been renamed Jaswantgarh, in honour of Rfn [[Jaswant Singh Rawat]] whose bravery at  Nuranang merited a posthumous Maha Vir Chakra. The other Maha Vir Chakra won in this conflict was won by Lt Col (later Maj Gen) BM Bhattacharjea, the indefatigable Commanding Officer under whose leadership the 4th  Battalion gave a bloody nose to the Chinese. In captivity, the survivors of the battalion were singled out for extra punishment in the Chinese PoW camp as retaliation for the heavy casualties the Chinese had suffered at the hands of the Garhwalis.\n\n==Indo-Pakistan War of 1965==\nIn 1965, the First Battalion fought at Gadra Road, the Second Battalion at OP Hill, the Sixth Battalion at Phillora and the Eighth Battalion at Butur Dograndi, where it lost two senior Officers viz Lt Col JE Jhirad and Major AR Khan within two days. The command then fell on to youngest captain (Lt Col) HS Rautela who lead by front and got gallantry commendation by then Chief of Army Staff. Captain CN Singh of the Regiment was posthumously awarded the MVC for gallantry whilst serving in HQ 120 Infantry Brigade. First Battalion and Eighth Battalion were honoured with battle honours \u2018GADRA ROAD\u2019 and \u2018BUTUR DOGRANDI\u2019 respectively. The Sixth Battalion was awarded the battle honour \u2018PHILLORA\u2019.\n\n'''Battle of Gadra City'''\nThe 1st Battalion was in the Rajasthan sector and distinguished itself in operations to take Gadra City, giving a fine display of infantry tactics in desert terrain without artillery support. The battalion went on to capture Jesse ke Par, Nawa Tala and Miajlar. Among those awarded the Vir Chakra was the CO Lt Col KP Lahiri. The Battalion won Battle Honour \u2018Gadra Road\u2019 and Theatre Honour \u2018Rajasthan 1965\u2019. Captain Narsingh bahadur Singh played an important role and for his gallantry and courageous efforts he was awarded with 'sena medal'.\n\n'''Operation Hill'''\nThe 2nd Battalion participated in the two assaults on \u2018OP Hill\u2019. Capt Chandra Narain Singh of the 2nd Battalion was attached to HQ 120 Infantry Brigade. In a gallant night action against raiders in the Galuthi area, he led the charge that killed six of the enemy while the rest fled, leaving behind large quantities of arms, ammunition and equipment. Capt CN Singh was hit by a machine gun burst in this action and laid down his life. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was in the Lahore sector, and participated in the advance up the GT Road. It suffered 33 killed, mostly due to very heavy enemy artillery fire. The 6th Battalion was in Sialkot where some of the fiercest fighting of the war took place. In the initial phase, the battalion took Charwa. It then held on doggedly to Phillaura, beating back several enemy attacks. The 8th Battalion was also in the Sialkot sector, and fought the bitterly contested battle of Buttur Dograndi, paying a heavy price including losing the Commanding Officer and the 2IC within a span of two days of heavy fighting. These actions brought more glory to the regiment by way of Battle Honour \"Buttur Dograndi\" and the Theatre Honour \"Punjab 1965\".\n\n==1971 War==\n[[File:A Garhwal Rifles recruit in the 1970s.jpg|thumb|right|Garhwal Rifles Recruit 1970s.]]\nThe 5th Battalion blazed a glorious trail during operations for the Liberation of Bangladesh. For its actions in the war, the battalion was awarded Battle Honour \u2018Hilli\u2019 and Theatre Honour \u2018East Pakistan 1971\u2019. The battalion won three Vir Chakras. The 12th Battalion had been in action since October 1971 and on commencement of active hostilities, took Hatibandha and participated in operations east of Dinajpur.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was in the Shakargarh sector. It took its initial objectives Dhandar and Mukhwal (south of Suchetgarh) and then into enemy territory to Bair Kalan. By the time of the ceasefire, the battalion had penetrated up to Ramri, north of Chakra. The 4th Battalion was in the Jhangar sector and conducted raids on enemy outposts while holding its own ground. The 6th Battalion was in the Sialkot sector. After re-taking Nawanpind, the battalion carried the defensive battle into enemy territory, mounting three strong raids on enemy posts opposite its area. The 7th Battalion was in the Chhamb sector, fighting a series of actions culminating in the re-capture of Sangram post by the time the ceasefire  was declared.\n\nThe 8th Battalion under the command of Maj H.S Rautela S.M.(now Ltcol) was also in a holding role in Punjab and captured enemy post Ghurki. In his honor the Gurki Village name was changed to Harish Nagar and was awarded the Sena Medal. They kept holding this post despite shelling that continued till the ceasefire.\n\nThe 10th Battalion fought a notable action led by Maj Mahabir Negi while capturing Raipur Crossing in the Akhnur-Jaurian sector. The Commanding Officer Lt Col Onkar Singh personally led one of the attacks, being critically wounded and later succumbing to his injuries.\n\n==Kargil War==\n[[File:18 Garhwal Riles Point 4700.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of 18th Battalion before assault on Point 4700]]\nThe 17th Battalion was in the Batalik sub-sector and was tasked with assaulting Area Bump and Kalapathar in the Jubar Heights, a ridgeline overlooking Jubar top, astride the National Highway. The climb was arduous and all companies were \u2018daylighted\u2019 except for Capt Jintu Gogoi's platoon. The gallant \u2018Bhullas\u2019 took Kalapathar in the face of heavy enemy fire, and then came face to face with an enemy UMG emplacement. To the enemy's total surprise, Capt Gogoi launched an immediate attack on the UMG sangar, killing two intruders in hand-to-hand combat, being mortally wounded in the process. Capt Jintu Gogoi was awarded the Vir Chakra posthumously for his bravery in utter disregard for his own safety, but sadly his name is not much known between the people like Captain Vikram Batra, who was also a Kargil martyr. The battalion launched fresh attacks in the subsequent days and took Bump and Kalapathar. This paved the way for further successes \u2013 the battalion proceeded to take another dominating feature in the Muntho Dhalo complex, finally taking Point 5285 despite heavy snowfall and effective enemy fire including artillery fire due to the proximity of this feature to the LOC. The battalion was awarded Battle Honour \u2018Batalik\u2019 for its exploits in Op Vijay.\n\nThe 18th Battalion was tasked to take Point 4700 and the surrounding heights where the enemy had consolidated their positions after being evicted from Tololing and Point 5140. In the subsequent operations, the Bhullas displayed gallantry of the highest order. Capt Sumeet Roy led a daredevil attack, climbing a sheer escarpment and taking the enemy sangar by surprise. His breakthrough paved the way for capture of Pt 4700. This brave officer was later mortally wounded by enemy fire on the objective and succumbed to his injuries. Capt Sumeet Roy was awarded the Vir Chakra posthumously. The adjoining features were assaulted by other companies of the 18th. Maj Rajesh Sah and Capt MV Sooraj led from the front, evicting the enemy from many a stronghold. Both these gallant officers were awarded the Vir Chakra for courageous leadership and bravery. The Bhullas of the 18th Battalion displayed indomitable courage, Nk Kashmir Singh, Rfn Anusuya Prasad and Rfn Kuldeep Singh all won the Vir Chakra posthumously. The battalion received an immediate award of the COAS\u2019 Unit Citation, in all winning six Vir Chakras, a Bar to the Sena Medal, seven Sena Medals and the Battle Honour \u2018Dras\u2019.\n\nBoth Battalions were awarded Theatre Honour \u2018Kargil\u2019.
