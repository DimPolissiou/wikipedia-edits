This function will only work on messages with length <math>s = w\\log(n/w)</math>; <math>r</math> will be the size of the output. Furthermore, we want <math>n,r,w,s</math> and <math>\\log(n/w)</math> to be natural numbers, where <math>\\log</math> denotes the [[binary logarithm]]. The reason for <math>w \\cdot \\log(n/w) > r</math> is that we want <math>\\phi</math> to be a compression function, so the input must be larger than the output. We will later use the [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] to extend the domain to inputs of arbitrary lengths.\n \nThe basis of this function consists of a (randomly chosen) binary <math>r \\times n</math> matrix <math>H</math> which acts on a message of <math>n</math> bits by [[matrix multiplication]]. Here we encode the <math>w\\log(n/w)</math>-bit message as a vector in <math>(\\mathbf{F}_2)^n</math>, the <math>n</math>-dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of two elements, so the output will be a message of <math>r</math> bits.\n\nFor security purposes as well as to get a faster hash speed we want to use only \u201cregular words of weight <math>w</math>\u201d as input for our matrix.\n\n=== Definitions ===\n* A message is called a '''word of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math>''' if it consists of <math>n</math> bits and exactly <math>w</math> of those bits are ones.\n* A word of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math> is called '''regular''' if in every interval <math>[(i-1)(n/w), i(n/w))</math> it contains exactly one nonzero entry for all <math>0 < i < w+1 </math>. More intuitively, this means that if we chop up the message in ''w'' equal parts, then each part contains exactly one nonzero entry.\n\n===The compression function===\nThere are exactly <math>(n/w)^w</math> different regular words of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math>, so we need exactly <math>\\log((n/w)^w)= w \\log(n/w) = s</math> bits of data to encode these regular words. We fix a bijection from the set of bit strings of length <math>s</math> to the set of regular words of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math> and then the FSB compression function is defined as follows :\n\n# input: a message of size <math>s</math>\n# convert to regular word of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math>\n# multiply by the matrix <math>H</math>\n# output: hash of size <math>r</math>\n\nThis version is usually called '''syndrome-based compression'''. It is very slow and in practice done in a different and faster way resulting in '''fast syndrome-based compression'''. We split <math>H</math> into sub-matrices <math>H_i</math> of size <math>r \\times n/w</math> and we fix a bijection from the bit strings of length <math>w\\log(n/w)</math> to the set of sequences of <math>w</math> numbers between 1 and <math>n/w</math>. This is equivalent to a bijection  to the set of regular words of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math>, since we can see such a word as a sequence of numbers between 1 and <math>n/w</math>. The compression function looks as follows:\n\n# Input: message of size <math>s</math>\n# Convert <math>s</math> to a sequence of <math>w</math> numbers <math>s_1,\\dots,s_w</math> between 1 and <math>n/w</math>\n# Add the corresponding columns of the matrices <math>H_i</math> to obtain a binary string a length <math>r</math>\n# Output: hash of size <math>r</math>\n\nWe can now use the [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] to generalize the compression function to accept inputs of arbitrary lengths.\n\n===Example of the compression===\n'''Situation and initialization''': Hash a message <math>s = 010011</math> using <math>4 \\times 12</math> matrix H <br />\n<math>\nH = \\left(\\begin{array}{llllcllllcllll}\n1&0&1&1 &~& 0&1&0&0 &~& 1&0&1&1 \\\\\n0&1&0&0 &~& 0&1&1&1 &~& 0&1&0&0 \\\\\n0&1&1&1 &~& 0&1&0&0 &~& 1&0&1&0 \\\\\n1&1&0&0 &~& 1&0&1&1 &~& 0&0&0&1 \n\\end{array}\\right)\n</math><br />\nthat is separated into <math>w = 3</math> sub-blocks <math>H_1</math>, <math>H_2</math>, <math>H_3</math>.\n\n'''Algorithm''':\n# We split the input <math>s</math> into <math>w = 3</math> parts of length <math>\\log_2(12/3) = 2</math> and we get <math>s_1 = 01</math>, <math>s_2 = 00</math>, <math>s_3 = 11</math>.\n# We convert each <math>s_i</math> into an integer and get <math>s_1 = 1</math>, <math>s_2 = 0</math>, <math>s_3 = 3</math>.\n# From the first sub-matrix <math>H_1</math>, we pick the column 2, from the second sub-matrix <math>H_2</math> the column 1 and from the third sub-matrix the column 4.\n# We add the chosen columns and obtain the result <math>r = 0111 \\oplus 0001 \\oplus 1001 = 1111</math>.\n\n== Security proof of FSB ==\nThe [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] is proven to base its security only on the security of the used compression function. So we only need to show that the compression function <math>\\phi</math> is secure.\n\nA cryptographic hash function needs to be secure in three different aspects:\n\n# Pre-image resistance: Given a Hash ''h'' it should be hard to find a message ''m'' such that Hash(''m'')=''h''\n# Second pre-image resistance:\tGiven a message ''m''<sub>1</sub> it should be hard to find a message ''m''<sub>2</sub> such that Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>)\n# Collision resistance: It should be hard to find two different messages ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''m''<sub>2</sub> such that Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>)=Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>)\n\nNote that if an adversary can find a second pre-image, then it can certainly find a collision. This means that if we can prove our system to be collision resistant, it will certainly be second-pre-image resistant.\n\nUsually in cryptography hard means something like \u201calmost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system\u201d. We will however need a more exact meaning of the word hard. We will take hard to mean \u201cThe runtime of any algorithm that finds a collision or pre-image will depend exponentially on size of the hash value\u201d. This means that by relatively small additions to the hash size, we can quickly reach high security.\n\n===Pre-image resistance and regular syndrome decoding (RSD) ===\nAs said before, the security of FSB depends on a problem called '''regular syndrome decoding (RSD)'''. Syndrome decoding is originally a problem from [[coding theory]] but its NP-completeness makes it a nice application for cryptography. Regular syndrome decoding is a special case of [[decoding methods|syndrome decoding]] and is defined as follows:\n\nDefinition of RSD: given <math>w</math> matrices <math>H_i</math> of dimension <math>r \\times (n/w)</math> and a bit string <math>S</math> of length <math>r</math> such that there exists a set of <math>w</math> columns, one in each <math>H_i</math>, summing to <math>S</math>. Find such a set of columns.\n\nThis problem has been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]]. Again, though it is not known whether there exist [[polynomial time]] algorithms for solving NP-complete problems, none are known and finding one would be a huge discovery.\n \nIt is easy to see that finding a pre-image of a given hash <math>S</math> is exactly equivalent to this problem, so the problem of finding pre-images in FSB must also be NP-complete.\n\nWe still need to prove collision resistance. For this we need another NP-complete variation of RSD: '''2-regular null syndrome decoding'''.\n\n===Collision resistance and 2-regular null syndrome decoding (2-RNSD)===\nDefinition of 2-RNSD: Given <math>w</math> matrices <math>H_i</math> of dimension <math>r \\times (n/w)</math> and a bit string <math>S</math> of length <math>r</math> such that there exists a set of <math>w'</math> columns, two or zero in each <math>H_i</math>, summing to zero. <math>(0 < w' < 2w)</math>. Find such a set of columns.\n\n2-RNSD has also been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]].\n\nJust like RSD is in essence equivalent to finding a regular word <math>w</math> such that <math>Hw = S</math>, 2-RNSD is equivalent to finding a 2-regular word <math>w'</math> such that <math>Hw'=0</math>. A 2-regular word of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math> is a bit string of length <math>n</math> such that in every interval <math>[(i-1)w , iw)</math> exactly two or zero entries are equal to 1. Note that a 2-regular word is just a sum of two regular words.\n\nSuppose that we have found a collision, so we have Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>) with <math>m_1\\neq m_2</math>. Then we can find two regular words <math>w_1</math> and <math>w_2</math> such that <math>Hw_1=Hw_2</math> . We then have <math>H(w_1+w_2)= Hw_1 + Hw_2 =2Hw_1=0</math>; <math>(w_1 + w_2)</math> is a sum of two different regular words and so must be a 2-regular word of which the hash is zero, so we have solved an instance of 2-RNSD. We conclude that finding collisions in FSB is at least as difficult as solving 2-RNSD and so must be NP-complete.\n\nThe latest versions of FSB use the compression function [[Whirlpool (cryptography)|Whirlpool]] to further compress the hash output. Though this cannot be proven, the authors argue that this last compression does not reduce security. Note that even if one were able to find collisions in Whirlpool, one would still need to find the collisions pre-images in the original FSB compression function to find a collision in FSB.\n\n===Examples===\nSolving RSD, we are in the opposite situation as when hashing. Using the same values as in the previous example, we are given <math>H</math> separated into <math>w=3</math> sub-blocks and a string <math>r = 1111</math>. We are asked to find in each sub-block exactly one column such that they would all sum to <math>r</math>. The expected answer is thus <math>s_1 = 1</math>, <math>s_2 = 0</math>, <math>s_3 = 3</math>. This is known to be hard to compute for large matrices.\n\nIn 2-RNSD we want to find in each sub-block not one column, but two or zero such that they would sum up to 0000 (and not to <math>r</math>). In the example, we might use column (counting from 0) 2 and 3 from <math>H_1</math>, no column from <math>H_2</math> column 0 and 2 from <math>H_3</math>. More solutions are possible, for example might use no columns from <math>H_3</math>.\n\n===Linear cryptanalysis===\nThe [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provable security]] of FSB means that finding collisions is NP-complete. But the proof is a reduction to a problem with asymptotically hard [[worst-case complexity]]. This offers only limited security assurance as there still can be an algorithm that easily solves the problem for a subset of the problem space. For example, there exists a [[Linear cryptanalysis|linearization]] method that can be used to produce collisions of in a matter of seconds on a desktop PC for early variants of FSB with claimed 2^128 security. It is shown that the hash function offers minimal pre-image or collision resistance when the message space is chosen in a specific way.\n\n===Practical security results===\nThe following table shows the complexity of the best known attacks against FSB.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Output size (bits)\n!Complexity of collision search\n!Complexity of inversion\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''160''' || 2<sup>100.3</sup> || 2<sup>163.6</sup> \n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''224''' || 2<sup>135.3</sup> || 2<sup>229.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''256''' || 2<sup>190.0</sup> || 2<sup>261.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''384''' || 2<sup>215.5</sup> || 2<sup>391.5</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''512''' || 2<sup>285.6</sup> || 2<sup>527.4</sup>\n|}\n\n==Genesis==\nFSB is a speed-up version of syndrome-based hash function (SB). In the case of SB the compression function is very similar to the encoding function of [[Niederreiter cryptosystem|Niederreiter's version]] of [[McEliece cryptosystem]]. Instead of using the parity check matrix of a permuted [[Goppa code]], SB uses a random matrix <math>H</math>. From the security point of view this can only strengthen the system.\n\n==Other properties==\n* Both the block size of the hash function and the output size are completely scalable.\n* The speed can be adjusted by adjusting the number of bitwise operations used by FSB per input bit.\n* The security can be adjusted by adjusting the output size.\n* Bad instances exist and one must take care when choosing the matrix <math>H</math>.\n* The matrix used in the compression function may grow large in certain situations. This might be a limitation when trying to use FSB on memory constrained devices. This problem was solved in the related hash function called Improved FSB, which is still [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure]], but relies on slightly stronger assumptions.\n\n==Variants==\nIn 2007, IFSB was published.<ref>https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Matthieu.Finiasz/research/2007/finiasz-gaborit-sendrier-ecrypt-hash-workshop07.pdf</ref> In 2010, S-FSB was published, which is 30% faster than the original.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135653/https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, [[D.

So we only need to show that the compression function <math>\\phi</math> is secure.\n\nA cryptographic hash function needs to be secure in three different aspects:\n\n# Pre-image resistance: Given a Hash ''h'' it should be hard to find a message ''m'' such that Hash(''m'')=''h''\n# Second pre-image resistance:\tGiven a message ''m''<sub>1</sub> it should be hard to find a message ''m''<sub>2</sub> such that Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>)\n# Collision resistance: It should be hard to find two different messages ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''m''<sub>2</sub> such that Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>)=Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>)\n\nNote that if an adversary can find a second pre-image, than he can certainly find a collision. This means that if we can prove our system to be collision resistant, it will certainly be second-pre-image resistant.\n\nUsually in cryptography hard means something like \u201calmost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system\u201d. We will however need a more exact meaning of the word hard. We will take hard to mean \u201cThe runtime of any algorithm that finds a collision or pre-image will depend exponentially on size of the hash value\u201d. This means that by relatively small additions to the hash size, we can quickly reach high security.\n\n===Pre-image resistance and regular syndrome decoding (RSD) ===\nAs said before, the security of FSB depends on a problem called '''regular syndrome decoding (RSD)'''. Syndrome decoding is originally a problem from [[coding theory]] but its NP-completeness makes it a nice application for cryptography. Regular syndrome decoding is a special case of [[decoding methods|syndrome decoding]] and is defined as follows:\n\nDefinition of RSD: given <math>w</math> matrices <math>H_i</math> of dimension <math>r \\times (n/w)</math> and a bit string <math>S</math> of length <math>r</math> such that there exists a set of <math>w</math> columns, one in each <math>H_i</math>, summing to <math>S</math>. Find such a set of columns.\n\nThis problem has been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]]. Again, though it is not known whether there exist [[polynomial time]] algorithms for solving NP-complete problems, none are known and finding one would be a huge discovery.\n \nIt is easy to see that finding a pre-image of a given hash <math>S</math> is exactly equivalent to this problem, so the problem of finding pre-images in FSB must also be NP-complete.\n\nWe still need to prove collision resistance. For this we need another NP-complete variation of RSD: '''2-regular null syndrome decoding'''.\n\n===Collision resistance and 2-regular null syndrome decoding (2-RNSD)===\nDefinition of 2-RNSD: Given <math>w</math> matrices <math>H_i</math> of dimension <math>r \\times (n/w)</math> and a bit string <math>S</math> of length <math>r</math> such that there exists a set of <math>w'</math> columns, two or zero in each <math>H_i</math>, summing to zero. <math>(0 < w' < 2w)</math>. Find such a set of columns.\n\n2-RNSD has also been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]].\n\nJust like RSD is in essence equivalent to finding a regular word <math>w</math> such that <math>Hw = S</math>, 2-RNSD is equivalent to finding a 2-regular word <math>w'</math> such that <math>Hw'=0</math>. A 2-regular word of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math> is a bit string of length <math>n</math> such that in every interval <math>[(i-1)w , iw)</math> exactly two or zero entries are equal to 1. Note that a 2-regular word is just a sum of two regular words.\n\nSuppose that we have found a collision, so we have Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>) with <math>m_1\\neq m_2</math>. Then we can find two regular words <math>w_1</math> and <math>w_2</math> such that <math>Hw_1=Hw_2</math> . We then have <math>H(w_1+w_2)= Hw_1 + Hw_2 =2Hw_1=0</math>; <math>(w_1 + w_2)</math> is a sum of two different regular words and so must be a 2-regular word of which the hash is zero, so we have solved an instance of 2-RNSD. We conclude that finding collisions in FSB is at least as difficult as solving 2-RNSD and so must be NP-complete.\n\nThe latest versions of FSB use the compression function [[Whirlpool (cryptography)|Whirlpool]] to further compress the hash output. Though this cannot be proven, the authors argue that this last compression does not reduce security. Note that even if one were able to find collisions in Whirlpool, one would still need to find the collisions pre-images in the original FSB compression function to find a collision in FSB.\n\n===Examples===\nSolving RSD, we are in the opposite situation as when hashing. Using the same values as in the previous example, we are given <math>H</math> separated into <math>w=3</math> sub-blocks and a string <math>r = 1111</math>. We are asked to find in each sub-block exactly one column such that they would all sum to <math>r</math>. The expected answer is thus <math>s_1 = 1</math>, <math>s_2 = 0</math>, <math>s_3 = 3</math>. This is known to be hard to compute for large matrices.\n\nIn 2-RNSD we want to find in each sub-block not one column, but two or zero such that they would sum up to 0000 (and not to <math>r</math>). In the example, we might use column (counting from 0) 2 and 3 from <math>H_1</math>, no column from <math>H_2</math> column 0 and 2 from <math>H_3</math>. More solutions are possible, for example might use no columns from <math>H_3</math>.\n\n===Linear cryptanalysis===\nThe [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provable security]] of FSB means that finding collisions is NP-complete. But the proof is a reduction to a problem with asymptotically hard [[worst-case complexity]]. This offers only limited security assurance as there still can be an algorithm that easily solves the problem for a subset of the problem space. For example, there exists a [[Linear cryptanalysis|linearization]] method that can be used to produce collisions of in a matter of seconds on a desktop PC for early variants of FSB with claimed 2^128 security. It is shown that the hash function offers minimal pre-image or collision resistance when the message space is chosen in a specific way.\n\n===Practical security results===\nThe following table shows the complexity of the best known attacks against FSB.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Output size (bits)\n!Complexity of collision search\n!Complexity of inversion\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''160''' || 2<sup>100.3</sup> || 2<sup>163.6</sup> \n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''224''' || 2<sup>135.3</sup> || 2<sup>229.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''256''' || 2<sup>190.0</sup> || 2<sup>261.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''384''' || 2<sup>215.5</sup> || 2<sup>391.5</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''512''' || 2<sup>285.6</sup> || 2<sup>527.4</sup>\n|}\n\n==Genesis==\nFSB is a speed-up version of syndrome-based hash function (SB). In the case of SB the compression function is very similar to the encoding function of [[Niederreiter cryptosystem|Niederreiter's version]] of [[McEliece cryptosystem]]. Instead of using the parity check matrix of a permuted [[Goppa code]], SB uses a random matrix <math>H</math>. From the security point of view this can only strengthen the system.\n\n==Other properties==\n* Both the block size of the hash function and the output size are completely scalable.\n* The speed can be adjusted by adjusting the number of bitwise operations used by FSB per input bit.\n* The security can be adjusted by adjusting the output size.\n* Bad instances exist and one must take care when choosing the matrix <math>H</math>.\n* The matrix used in the compression function may grow large in certain situations. This might be a limitation when trying to use FSB on memory constrained devices. This problem was solved in the related hash function called Improved FSB, which is still [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure]], but relies on slightly stronger assumptions.\n\n==Variants==\nIn 2007, IFSB was published.<ref>https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Matthieu.Finiasz/research/2007/finiasz-gaborit-sendrier-ecrypt-hash-workshop07.pdf</ref> In 2010, S-FSB was published, which is 30% faster than the original.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135653/https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, [[D.

She produced the song with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. It was released on September 12, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the lead single from Swift's second studio album ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). Considered as her [[List of signature songs|signature song]], it was written about a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced ''Romeo and Juliet''{{'}}s original [[tragedy|tragic]] conclusion with a [[happy ending]]. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy [[soprano]] voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of [[Juliet]].\n\nThe song received wide critical praise with critics complimenting Swift's writing style and the song's plot. It was a commercial success, selling over 18 million copies worldwide<!--- DO NOT CHANGE THE GLOBAL SALES FIGURE WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE --->, therefore establishing itself among the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]]. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over 9 million paid digital downloads, becoming Swift's best-selling single to date and was once the best-selling download by a female country solo artist. It is also one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States|best-selling singles in the United States]] and it was once the best-selling digital country single of all time there. The single was certified 8\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Internationally, \"Love Story\" became Swift's first number one single in Australia, followed by \"[[Shake It Off]]\" in 2014. The song has been certified 7x platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). The song is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles worldwide]], with worldwide sales of more than 15 millions of units by 2010 (according to the [[IFPI]]).<ref name=\"IFPIlovestory\">{{cite web|title=IFPI Digital Music Report 2010|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/dmr2010.pdf|website=IFPI Digital Music Report 2010 \u2013 Page 10|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video is a [[period piece]] that drew influences from the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[British Regency]] (1813) eras. It follows Swift and model [[Justin Gaston]] as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves in a prior era. \"Love Story\" was promoted through numerous live performances. The song was included on all of Swift's headlining tours, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009\u201310), the [[Speak Now World Tour]] (2011\u201312), [[The Red Tour]] (2013\u201314), [[The 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and the [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018). \"Love Story\" has been [[cover version|covered]] by several artists, including [[Joe McElderry]] and [[Forever the Sickest Kids]].\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\n\"Love Story\" came along late into the production of ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|title=Taylor's Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Jann Wenner|first=Austin|last=Scaggs}}</ref> Swift wrote \"Love Story\" about a man who was never officially her [[boyfriend]].

Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed. When writing the song, she envisioned it in a prior time period, and encoded it with details accordingly.<ref name=\"cmtreplay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/misc/316863/video-replay-taylor-swift-love-story.jhtml|title=Video Replay: Taylor Swift \u2013 Love Story|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> She believed \"Love Story\"'s plot was a timeless scenario: \"I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008.\"<ref name=\"onset\" /> Thus, she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest.<ref name=\"onsetwhitehorse\">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'White Horse'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> With six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of ''[[Nashville Star]]'', recommended contestant [[Justin Gaston]]. Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video.<ref name=\"latimesgaston\">{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/10/whos-that-romeo.html|title=Who's that Romeo in Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" video?|first=Randy|last=Lewis|date=October 16, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref> Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a \"[[Prince Charming]] that could've been alive in the 1800s.\"<ref name=\"onsetwhitehorse\" /> However, because Gaston was competing on ''Nashville Star'', he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video.<ref name=\"onset\" /> Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: \"I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well.\"<ref name=\"latimesgaston\" />\n\nA castle was chosen for the video's setting. Personnel researched numerous castles in the United States and were unable to locate one in sufficient condition for filming. They had considered traveling to Europe to find a castle, but were then informed about a castle south of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Named Castle Gwynn, a castle that is part of the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, both located in [[Arrington, Tennessee]], it was built in 1973 and chosen as the video's setting.<ref name=\"onset\" /> Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene. The dress was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift.<ref name=\"onset\" /><ref name=\"cmtreplay\" /> \"She loves to put her input in her dresses\", stated Spika. The two had discussed the dress two months prior to the filming of the video. Accentuates were made on the video set.<ref name=\"onset\" /> The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot. On the set, someone had replaced the [[playback singer|playback]] CD with a high-pitch, altered version of the song. As a result, Swift lent the crew her [[iPod]] to play the original track.<ref name=\"onset\" /> While filming another scene, sunset was about to occur and, therefore, the process was executed rather rapidly. For the scene, Fanjoy suggested a kiss between Swift and Gaston, but Swift refused to because she believed it would make for a sweeter moment. On the second day, scenes at [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] and at a ballroom were filmed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_spl/episode/0,,GAC_26200_59982,00.htm|title=Taylor Swift on the Set: Love Story|work=Great American Country|publisher=Scripps Network Interactive|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062635/http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_spl/episode/0,,GAC_26200_59982,00.htm|archive-date=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swift learned the choreography for the latter in fifteen minutes prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.<ref name=\"onset\" />\n\nThe video commences with Swift, clothed in a black sweater and jeans, walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in what seems to be an 18th century castle, where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and sings in a balcony. Afterwards, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other young women. The two, along with others, engage in [[ballroom dancing]]. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Later on, Swift stands in the balcony again, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running towards her and she immediately runs down the castle's staircase to meet him. Swift and Gaston meet in the field right in front of the castle and hold each other. The video then transitions back into the modern-day college campus as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 500 million views on YouTube.\n\n===Video reception===\nThe video premiered on September 12, 2008 on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1594680/taylor-swift-premiering-new-video-on-cmt.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Premiering New Video on CMT|date=September 12, 2008|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> Mandi Bierly of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was concerned about the video marking Swift's artistic evolution because it seemed too expensive and made her wonder if anything else about Swift would change.

song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. She produced the song with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. It was released on September 12, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the lead single from Swift's second studio album ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). Considered as her [[List of signature songs|signature song]], it was written about a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced ''Romeo and Juliet''{{'}}s original [[tragedy|tragic]] conclusion with a [[happy ending]]. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy [[soprano]] voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of [[Juliet]].\n\nThe song received wide critical praise with critics complimenting Swift's writing style and the song's plot. It was a commercial success, selling over 18 million copies worldwide<!--- DO NOT CHANGE THE GLOBAL SALES FIGURE WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE --->, therefore establishing itself among the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]]. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over 9 million paid digital downloads, becoming Swift's best-selling single to date and was once the best-selling download by a female country solo artist. It is also one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States|best-selling singles in the United States]] and it was once the best-selling digital country single of all time there. The single was certified 8\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Internationally, \"Love Story\" became Swift's first number one single in Australia, followed by \"[[Shake It Off]]\" in 2014. The song has been certified 7x platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). The song is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles worldwide]], with worldwide sales of more than 15 millions of units by 2010 (according to the [[IFPI]]).<ref name=\"IFPIlovestory\">{{cite web|title=IFPI Digital Music Report 2010|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/dmr2010.pdf|website=IFPI Digital Music Report 2010 \u2013 Page 10|accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video is a [[period piece]] that drew influences from the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[British Regency]] (1813) eras. It follows Swift and model [[Justin Gaston]] as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves in a prior era. \"Love Story\" was promoted through numerous live performances. The song was included on all of Swift's headlining tours, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009\u201310), the [[Speak Now World Tour]] (2011\u201312), [[The Red Tour]] (2013\u201314), [[The 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and the [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018). \"Love Story\" has been [[cover version|covered]] by several artists, including [[Joe McElderry]] and [[Forever the Sickest Kids]].\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\n\"Love Story\" came along late into the production of ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|title=Taylor's Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Jann Wenner|first=Austin|last=Scaggs}}</ref> Swift wrote \"Love Story\" about a man who was never officially her [[boyfriend]].

The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and [[audio engineer]] [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]] for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a \"try this for a while\" experiment.

Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video.<ref name=\"latimesgaston\">{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/10/whos-that-romeo.html|title=Who's that Romeo in Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" video?|first=Randy|last=Lewis|date=October 16, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref> Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a \"[[Prince Charming]] that could've been alive in the 1800s.\"<ref name=\"onsetwhitehorse\" /> However, because Gaston was competing on ''Nashville Star'', he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video.<ref name=\"onset\" /> Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: \"I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well.\"<ref name=\"latimesgaston\" />\n\nA castle was chosen for the video's setting. Personnel researched numerous castles in the United States and were unable to locate one in sufficient condition for filming. They had considered traveling to Europe to find a castle, but were then informed about a castle south of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Named Castle Gwynn, a castle that is part of the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, both located in [[Arrington, Tennessee]], it was built in 1973 and chosen as the video's setting.<ref name=\"onset\" /> Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene. The dress was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift.<ref name=\"onset\" /><ref name=\"cmtreplay\" /> \"She loves to put her input in her dresses\", stated Spika. The two had discussed the dress two months prior to the filming of the video. Accentuates were made on the video set.<ref name=\"onset\" /> The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot. On the set, someone had replaced the [[playback singer|playback]] CD with a high-pitch, altered version of the song. As a result, Swift lent the crew her [[iPod]] to play the original track.<ref name=\"onset\" /> While filming another scene, sunset was about to occur and, therefore, the process was executed rather rapidly. For the scene, Fanjoy suggested a kiss between Swift and Gaston, but Swift refused to because she believed it would make for a sweeter moment. On the second day, scenes at [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] and at a ballroom were filmed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_spl/episode/0,,GAC_26200_59982,00.htm|title=Taylor Swift on the Set: Love Story|work=Great American Country|publisher=Scripps Network Interactive|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062635/http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_spl/episode/0,,GAC_26200_59982,00.htm|archive-date=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swift learned the choreography for the latter in fifteen minutes prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.<ref name=\"onset\" />\n\nThe video commences with Swift, clothed in a black sweater and jeans, walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in what seems to be an 18th century castle, where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and sings in a balcony. Afterwards, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other young women. The two, along with others, engage in [[ballroom dancing]]. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Later on, Swift stands in the balcony again, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running towards her and she immediately runs down the castle's staircase to meet him. Swift and Gaston meet in the field right in front of the castle and hold each other. The video then transitions back into the modern-day college campus as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 500 million views on YouTube.\n\n===Video reception===\nThe video premiered on September 12, 2008 on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1594680/taylor-swift-premiering-new-video-on-cmt.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Premiering New Video on CMT|date=September 12, 2008|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> Mandi Bierly of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was concerned about the video marking Swift's artistic evolution because it seemed too expensive and made her wonder if anything else about Swift would change.

He played [[college football]] at [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]] where he was an [[All-America]]n. He played several seasons with the Jets in the AFL and NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/player/alwoodall/2529312/profile|title=Al Woodall|website=NFL.com|accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref>  He started several games in 1970, 1971, and 1973, subbing for an injured Joe Namath.  Woodall retired after spending the 1975 season on injured reserve with torn knee ligaments.\n\n==College career==\nAl Woodall was recruited by Duke University out of Erwin High School in North Carolina. In 1966, he took over as starting quarterback for the Duke Blue Devils, replacing Todd Orvald, who had struggled. That season, Woodall completed 39 passes, which was the ninth most in the ACC. The next season, with Orvald graduated and Woodall the most experienced signal caller on the roster, he was penciled in as the starter. However, the football team, under head coach [[Tom Harp]], struggled to a 4-6 record. Woodall, however, had a strong season stats wise. His 79 pass completeions was good enough for second in the ACC, finishing behind Clemson's Jimmy Addison, who had 82. Woodall finished sixth in pass attempts with 150, but led the conference in pass completion percentage with 52.7, passing yards per attempt with 6.8 yards per attempt, and passing yards with 1,019.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/conferences/acc/1967-leaders.html</ref>\n\n==Pro career==\nIn the 1969 draft, the Jets selected Woodall in the second round to provide insurance for starter [[Joe Namath]]. While Namath had led the Jets to a victory in [[Super Bowl III]] the season prior, there was concern over his chronic knee issues. As a rookie in 1969, Woodall appeared in only four games. He performed mop up duty in the Jets 34-16 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and in their 40-7 blowout of the Cincinnati Bengals the following week. When the 1969 season ended, Woodall had completed 4 passes on 9 attempts, with two interceptions thrown against zero touchdown passes. \n\nWith the 1970 season looming, the Jets had concern at the quarterback position. Namath had invested in a nightclub called Bachelors III. While the club attracted movie stars, well-known pro athletes, it also attracted elements of the underground gambling scene. when Namath was directed by the league to divest himself from the nightclub because of the gambling element, Namath balked and threatened to retire from pro football.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA34&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> With Namath's status in question, Woodall began to take first team reps, thinking he might be the starter going into the 1970 season. Namath back-pedaled from his retirement threats and sold his interest in the nightclub. \n\nHowever, knee issues that Jets management had been concerned about became reality. Due to injury, Woodall drew the first start of his pro career, a 10-6 loss to the hapless Buffalo Bills. The Woodall-led Jets failed to reach the end zone, and instead, had to settle for two Jim Turner field goals.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197010250nyj.htm</ref> The Jets would lose the next two games, and finally broke their losing streak when they upset the George Allen led [[Los Angeles Rams]] 31-20. In that game Woodall went 10 for 17 with three touchdown passes, including an 11-yard pass to [[George Sauer]] that put the game out of reach.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197011150ram.htm</ref> The next week the Jets faced the 1-9 [[Boston Patriots]], led by quarterback [[Joe Kapp]], who just two seasons prior had led the [[Minnesota Vikings]] to the Super Bowl. Woodall and the offense struggled, and Woodall was sacked twice, but the Jets managed to come away with a 17-3 victory.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197011220nyj.htm</ref>. The following week the 4-7 Jets beat the 9-2 Vikings 20-10, but then lost to the [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Baltimore Colts]] to finish the season 4-10.\n\nIn 1971, Woodall was called upon to start five games, going 1-4 during that time, with the lone victory coming at the expense of the Dolphins. He did not appear in a game during the 1972 season, but would start six games during the 1973 season, going 1-5.

He played [[college football]] at [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]] where he was an [[All-America]]n. He played several seasons with the Jets in the AFL and NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/player/alwoodall/2529312/profile|title=Al Woodall|website=NFL.com|accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref>  He started several games in 1970, 1971, and 1973, subbing for an injured Joe Namath.  Woodall retired after spending the 1975 season on injured reserve with torn knee ligaments.\n\n==College career==\nAl Woodall was recruited by Duke University out of Erwin High School in North Carolina. In 1966, he took over as starting quarterback for the Duke Blue Devils, replacing Todd Orvald, who had struggled. That season, Woodall completed 39 passes, which was the ninth most in the ACC. The next season, with Orvald graduated and Woodall the most experienced signal caller on the roster, he was penciled in as the starter. However, the football team, under head coach [[Tom Harp]], struggled to a 4-6 record. Woodall, however, had a strong season stats wise. His 79 pass completeions was good enough for second in the ACC, finishing behind Clemson's Jimmy Addison, who had 82. Woodall finished sixth in pass attempts with 150, but led the conference in pass completion percentage with 52.7, passing yards per attempt with 6.8 yards per attempt, and passing yards with 1,019.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/conferences/acc/1967-leaders.html</ref>\n\n==Pro career==\nIn the 1969 draft, the Jets selected Woodall in the second round to provide insurance for starter [[Joe Namath]]. While Namath had led the Jets to a victory in [[Super Bowl III]] the season prior, there was concern over his chronic knee issues. As a rookie in 1969, Woodall appeared in only four games. He performed mop up duty in the Jets 34-16 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and in their 40-7 blowout of the Cincinnati Bengals the following week. When the 1969 season ended, Woodall had completed 4 passes on 9 attempts, with two interceptions thrown against zero touchdown passes. \n\nWith the 1970 season looming, the Jets had concern at the quarterback position. Namath had invested in a nightclub called Bachelors III. While the club attracted movie stars, well-known pro athletes, it also attracted elements of the underground gambling scene. when Namath was directed by the league to divest himself from the nightclub because of the gambling element, Namath balked and threatened to retire from pro football.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA34&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> With Namath's status in question, Woodall began to take first team reps, thinking he might be the starter going into the 1970 season. Namath back-pedaled from his retirement threats and sold his interest in the nightclub. \n\nHowever, knee issues that Jets management had been concerned about became reality. Due to injury, Woodall drew the first start of his pro career, a 10-6 loss to the hapless Buffalo Bills. The Woodall led Jets failed to reach the end zone, and instead, had to settle for two Jim Turner field goals.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197010250nyj.htm</ref> The Jets would lose the next two games, and finally broke their losing streak when they upset the George Allen led [[Los Angeles Rams]] 31-20. In that game Woodall went 10 for 17 with three touchdown passes, including an 11-yard pass to [[George Sauer]] that put the game out of reach.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197011150ram.htm</ref> The next week the Jets faced the 1-9 [[Boston Patriots]], led by quarterback [[Joe Kapp]], who just two seasons prior had led the [[Minnesota Vikings]] to the Super Bowl. Woodall and the offense struggled, and Woodall was sacked twice, but the Jets managed to come away with a 17-3 victory.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197011220nyj.htm</ref>. The following week the 4-7 Jets beat the 9-2 Vikings 20-10, but then lost to the [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Baltimore Colts]] to finish the season 4-10.\n\nIn 1971, Woodall was called upon to start five games, going 1-4 during that time, with the lone victory coming at the expense of the Dolphins. He did not appear in a game during the 1972 season, but would start six games during the 1973 season, going 1-5. He had been called in to relieve an ineffective Namath in the season opener against the [[Green Bay Packers]], led by quarterback Scott Hunter. The Packers had been shutting out the Jets until Woodall came off the bench to lead a scoring drive the ended with a touchdown strike to David Knight.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19730918&id=iAgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=888,2181330</ref>  In 1974, under new Jets head coach [[Charley Winner]], the Jets finished 7-7 with Woodall again just appearing in relief of Namath.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodAl00/gamelog/1974/</ref> Woodall's own status for the 1971 season was cause for concern he was injured in a 21-16 preseason loss to Kansas City.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/01/archives/woodall-of-jets-suffers-fracture-of-his-left-wrist-xrays-show.html</ref> \n\nBy the time his career was over, Woodall had a 5-14 record as a starter in the NFL, while throwing 18 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. \n\nDuring his time with the Jets, Woodall was a roommate of future hall of fame running back [[John Riggins]].
