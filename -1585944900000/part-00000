It was written by [[Sean Garrett]], [[Polow Da Don|Jamal Jones]], [[Jason Perry (rock singer)|Jason Perry]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and produced by the former two alongside [[Ron Fair]], Tal Herzberg and Young Smoke. It was remixed with additional vocals from American rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] and was released as a [[Music download|digital download]] on April 11, 2006 as the album's fourth single. \"Buttons\" contains elements of [[Middle Eastern music]], while the song's lyrics speaks of a woman's desire to be undressed.\n\nCritics were divided on \"Buttons\" with some complimenting the song's production; however, others criticized how it followed the same formula of their previous singles. The song reached the top-five in countries such as Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number one in Austria and in New Zealand, where it became their fourth consecutive number one single on the chart. It peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over two million copies in the United States, making The Pussycat Dolls the first female group in digital history to have three singles pass the two million mark in digital sales.\n\nThe [[sepia tone|sepia]]-toned [[music video]] directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] features The Pussycat Dolls in various dance sequences. Other scenes include Scherzinger by herself singing the verses. Since its release, \"Buttons\" has become a staple in Scherzinger's live performances. It was part of the set lists of the group's two major tours, [[PCD World Tour]] (2006\u201307), [[Doll Domination Tour]] (2009) and Scherzinger's own [[Killer Love|Killer Love Tour]] (2012).

It was written by [[Sean Garrett]], [[Polow Da Don|Jamal Jones]], [[Jason Perry (rock singer)|Jason Perry]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and produced by the former two alongside [[Ron Fair]], Tal Herzberg and Young Smoke. It was remixed with additional vocals from American rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] and was released as a [[Music download|digital download]] on April 11, 2006 as the album's fourth single. \"Buttons\" contains elements of [[Middle Eastern music]], while the song's lyrics speaks of a woman's desire to be undressed.\n\nCritics were divided on \"Buttons\" with some complimenting the song's production; however, others criticized how it followed the same formula of their previous singles. The song reached the top-five in countries such as Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number one in Austria and in New Zealand, where it became their fourth consecutive number one single on the chart. It peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over two million copies in the United States, making The Pussycat Dolls the first female group in digital history to have three singles pass the two million mark in digital sales.\n\nThe [[sepia tone|sepia]]-toned [[music video]] directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] features The Pussycat Dolls in various dance sequences. Other scenes include Scherzinger by herself singing the verses. Since its release, \"Buttons\" has become a staple in Scherzinger's live performances. It was part of the set lists of the group's two major tours, [[PCD World Tour]] (2006\u201307), [[Doll Domination Tour]] (2009) and Scherzinger's own [[Killer Love|Killer Love Tour]] (2012). It was nominated for two awards at the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]] for Best Dance Video and Best Choreography; it won the former award.\n\n== Background and composition ==\n{{Listen\n | filename = ButtonsSample.ogg\n | title = \"Buttons\"\n | description = A 24-second sample of \"Buttons\"\n|pos=right\n}}\n\n\"Buttons\" was written by [[Sean Garrett]], [[Polow Da Don|Jamal Jones]], [[Jason Perry (rock singer)|Jason Perry]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and produced by the former two alongside [[Ron Fair]], Tal Herzberg and Young Smoke.<ref name=\"albumcredits\"/> Garrett wrote the song in a short amount of time, with Nicole Scherzinger in mind saying, \"[she] is very sexy so the concept of loosening up her buttons,\u2014every guy would want that and women wouldn't have a problem with guys loosening up their buttons.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2012/11/sean-garrett-25-essential-songs/|title=Sean Garrett Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records\n|author=Complex Staff|date=November 22, 2012|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref> The vocal production of \"Buttons\" was completed by Fair while engineering was handled by J.D.

When Snoop Dogg's verse begins, The Pussycat Dolls are shown walking towards him. During the breakdown, the girls dance while smoke is filled and halfway through the video, the floor turns on fire. The video ends with the girls walking away.\n\n===Recognition===\nTom Breihan from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ranked the video at number 10 on his favorite videos of 2006 for its \"flashy editing, decent choreography, a distinct look.

It is the only [[Family (biology)|family]] in the '''Moniliformida''' [[Order (biology)|order]] and contains three [[genera]]: ''Australiformis'' containing a single species, ''Moniliformis'' containing eighteen species and ''Promoniliformis'' containing a single species. Genetic analysis have determined that the [[clade]] is [[monophyletic]] despite being distributed globally. These worms primarily [[Parasitism|parasitize]] mammals by attaching themselves into the intestinal wall using their hook-covered [[proboscis]]. The intermediate hosts are mostly cockroaches. The distinguishing features of this order among [[archiacanthocephala]]ns is the presence of a cylindrical proboscis with long rows of hooks with posteriorly directed roots and proboscis retractor muscles that pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle. Infestation with Monoliformida species can cause moniliformiasis, an intestinal condition characterized as causing [[lesions]], [[Abdominal distension|intestinal distension]], [[perforated ulcer]]s, [[enteritis]], [[gastritis]], [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypt]] [[hypertrophy]], [[goblet cell]] [[hyperplasia]], and blockages.\n\n==Taxonomy and description==\n\nSpecies of the family ''Moniliformidae'' are usually pseudosegmented and have a cylindrical proboscis with longitudinal rows of hooks that have posteriorly directed roots. Moniliformidae are further characterized by the presence of a simple, double-walled proboscis receptacle with the outer wall having spirally aligned muscle fibers (with the exception of ''Australiformis''), brain at posterior end of receptacle, and dorsal and ventral lacunar canals.<ref name=\"Schmidt1989\"/><ref name=\"K\u00fckenthal\">{{cite book |last=K\u00fckenthal|first=W |date=2014 |title=Gastrotricha and Gnathifera |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hwCTBgAAQBAJ&pg=PP11&dq=K%C3%BCkenthal,+W.+(2014).+Gastrotricha+and+Gnathifera.+Walter+de+Gruyter+GmbH+and+Co+KG.#v=onepage&q=apororhynchus&f=false |location=[[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |page=322 |isbn=978-3110274271}}</ref> The proboscis retractor muscles pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle.<ref name = \"Amin1987\">{{cite journal |last1=Amin |first1=O.

In the intermediate host, the acanthor, or the parasite in its first larval stage, morphs into the acanthella, the second larval stage. After 6 to 12 weeks in this stage, the acanthella becomes a cystacanth. The cystacanth, or infective acanthella, of ''M. moniliformis'' are cyst-shaped and encyst in the tissues of the intermediate hosts in contrast to most other acanthocephalans which have infective larvae that more closely resemble underdeveloped adult worms. The definitive hosts consume the cystacanths upon feeding on infested intermediate hosts. These cystacanths mature and mate in the small intestine in 8 to 12 weeks. After this time, the eggs are excreted with the feces, to be ingested yet again by another intermediate host and renew this cycle.<ref name = \"CDC\" />   In what is commonly known as \"brain-jacking,\" the parasite induces a behavioural change in its intermediate host that increases the risk of predation for the host. It is thought that this behavioral change holds an evolutionary advantage for the parasite by increasing its chances of getting to its definitive host. When ''M. moniliformis'' infests its intermediate host, the cockroach species ''[[Periplaneta americana]]'', it changes the cockroach's escape response. In one study, it was concluded that cockroaches infected by ''M. moniliformis'' took longer to respond to wind stimuli simulating the approach of a potential predator and displayed fewer escape responses implying that the parasite infection renders its intermediate host more vulnerable to predation by hindering its ability to detect and escape from its predator. It is thought that serotonin plays a role in upending the communication between giant interneurons and the thoracic interneurons and in turn hampers the escape response of the cockroach.<ref name=\"Berenji2007\"/> In a similar study, the effects of parasitism on three [[Periplaneta]] species found that ''[[Periplaneta australasiae]]'' uses substrates differently and moves around less when infected with ''M. moniliformis''.<ref name = \"Moore 1994\">{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = J. | last2 = Freehling | first2 = M. | last3 = Gotelli | first3 = N.

These worms primarily [[Parasitism|parasitize]] mammals by attaching themselves into the intestinal wall using their hook-covered [[proboscis]]. The intermediate hosts are mostly cockroaches. The distinguishing features of this order among [[archiacanthocephala]]ns is the presence of a cylindrical proboscis with long rows of hooks with posteriorly directed roots and proboscis retractor muscles that pierce both the posterior and ventral end or just posterior end of the receptacle. Infestation with Monoliformida species can cause moniliformiasis, an intestinal condition characterized as causing [[lesions]], [[Abdominal distension|intestinal distension]], [[perforated ulcer]]s, [[enteritis]], [[gastritis]], [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypt]] [[hypertrophy]], [[goblet cell]] [[hyperplasia]], and blockages.\n\n==Taxonomy and description==\n\nSpecies of the family ''Moniliformidae'' are usually pseudosegmented and have a cylindrical proboscis with longitudinal rows of hooks that have posteriorly directed roots.

In the intermediate host, the acanthor, or the parasite in its first larval stage, morphs into the acanthella, the second larval stage. After 6 to 12 weeks in this stage, the acanthella becomes a cystacanth. The cystacanth, or infective acanthella, of ''M. moniliformis'' are cyst-shaped and encyst in the tissues of the intermediate hosts in contrast to most other acanthocephalans which have infective larvae that more closely resemble underdeveloped adult worms. The definitive hosts consume the cystacanths upon feeding on infested intermediate hosts. These cystacanths mature and mate in the small intestine in 8 to 12 weeks. After this time, the eggs are excreted with the feces, to be ingested yet again by another intermediate host and renew this cycle.<ref name = \"CDC\" />   In what is commonly known as \"brain-jacking,\" the parasite induces a behavioural change in its intermediate host that increases the risk of predation for the host. It is thought that this behavioral change holds an evolutionary advantage for the parasite by increasing its chances of getting to its definitive host. When ''M. moniliformis'' infests its intermediate host, the cockroach species ''[[Periplaneta americana]]'', it changes the cockroach's escape response. In one study, it was concluded that cockroaches infected by ''M. moniliformis'' took longer to respond to wind stimuli simulating the approach of a potential predator and displayed fewer escape responses implying that the parasite infection renders its intermediate host more vulnerable to predation by hindering its ability to detect and escape from its predator. It is thought that serotonin plays a role in upending the communication between giant interneurons and the thoracic interneurons and in turn hampers the escape response of the cockroach.<ref name=\"Berenji2007\"/> In a similar study, the effects of parasitism on three [[Periplaneta]] species found that ''[[Periplaneta australasiae]]'' uses substrates differently and moves around less when infected with ''M. moniliformis''.<ref name = \"Moore 1994\">{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = J. | last2 = Freehling | first2 = M. | last3 = Gotelli | first3 = N.

It is the opening track and lead single from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it number 495 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and at number five on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596335/brown_sugar/ \"Brown Sugar\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 9 December 2004 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref>\n\n==Inspiration and recording==\nThough credited, like most of their compositions, to the singer/guitarist pair of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], the song was primarily the work of Jagger, who wrote it sometime during the filming of ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' in 1969.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923165126/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 \"Jagger Remembers\"].

It is also claimed it was written with [[Claudia Lennear]] in mind. Lennear claimed to be the song's subject on BBC's [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] (25 February 2014, ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]''), because she kept Jagger's company at the time when it was written.\n\n\"Brown Sugar\" was recorded over a three-day period at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], from 2 to 4 December 1969. The song was not released until over a year later due to legal wranglings with the band's former label. At the request of guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] (who had joined the band as [[Brian Jones]]' replacement in July 1969), the Stones debuted the number live during the infamous concert at the [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont]] Speedway on 6 December 1969. \n\nIn the [[liner notes]] to the compilation album ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'' (1993), Jagger says, \"The lyric was all to do with the dual combination of drugs and girls. This song was a very instant thing, a definite high point\".<ref>Covach, John (2005), \"Form in Rock Music: A Primer\", in Stein, Deborah, ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', New York: Oxford University Press, p.74-75, {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}} .</ref>\n\nIn the ''Rolling Stone'' interview (14 December 1995, RS 723) Jagger spoke at length about the song, its inspiration and success, and taking credit for writing the lyrics. Keith Richards also credits Jagger with the song in his autobiography.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life|last=Richards|first=Keith|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2010|isbn=978-0-316-03438-8|location=New York|pages=178}}</ref> He attributed the success of the song to a \"good groove\".

He noted, \"That makes it... the whole mess thrown in. God knows what I'm on about on that song. It's such a mishmash. All the nasty subjects in one go... I never would write that song now.\" When [[Jann Wenner|interviewer Jann Wenner]] asked him why, Jagger replied, \"I would probably censor myself. I'd think, 'Oh God, I can't. I've got to stop. I can't just write raw like that.{{'\"}}<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5/ \"Jagger Remembers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205235627/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 |date=5 December 2009 }}. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995.</ref>\n\nThe lyrical subject matter has often been a point of interest and controversy. Described by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as \"a rocker so compelling that it discourages [[exegesis]]\",<ref>[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php Robert Christgau \"Rolling Stones\"].

It features appearances by [[Al Kooper]] on piano, and [[Eric Clapton]] on slide guitar. Richards considered releasing this version on ''Sticky Fingers'', mostly for its more spontaneous atmosphere, but decided on the original.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian McPherson |url=http://timeisonourside.com/SOBrown.html |title=Brown Sugar |website=Timeisonourside.com |date=1969-12-02 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> The alternative version, which had previously been available only on [[bootleg recording]]s, was released in June 2015 on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions of the reissued ''Sticky Fingers'' album.\n\n==''Top of the Pops''==\nTo promote the song, the Rolling Stones performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the performance taped sometime around late March 1971, and being shown on 15 April and 6 May. They performed \"Brown Sugar\", \"[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" for the show's segment dedicated to albums, which was shown on 22 April 1971; due to BBC practices at the time, the performances were [[wiping|erased]] and all that remains is \"Brown Sugar\".\n\n==Release==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was eventually released in April 1971 as the first single from the album, becoming a number one hit in both the United States and Canada and a number two hit in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, and has since become a [[classic rock]] radio staple. While the US single featured only \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" as the B-side, the British single featured that track plus a live rendition of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]\", recorded at the [[University of Leeds]] during the 1971 tour of the United Kingdom. In the United States, ''Billboard'' ranked it as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1971|number 16 song for 1971]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was originally issued in mono using a now-rarely heard bespoke mono mix. This mono mix has never been used on any compilation.\n\nThe song was performed routinely during the Stones' [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1970|1970 European Tour]], occupying a prominent spot near the end of the [[set list]] even though audiences were unfamiliar with it. The band opened the shows of their infamous [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]] with \"Brown Sugar\", and it has become a Stones concert staple.\n\nWhen the Stones perform \"Brown Sugar\" live, Jagger often changes the lyrics from \"Just like a young girl should\" to \"Just like a young man should\". The line \"Hear him whip the women just around midnight\" is often changed to the less offensive \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight\". This is evident on their live albums ''[[Love You Live]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'', ''[[Live Licks]]'', ''[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|Shine a Light]]'',''[[Stripped (The Rolling Stones album)#Totally Stripped|Totally Stripped]]'', and Voodoo Lounge Uncut.

It is the opening track and lead single from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it number 495 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] and at number five on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596335/brown_sugar/ \"Brown Sugar\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 9 December 2004 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref>\n\n==Inspiration and recording==\nThough credited, like most of their compositions, to the singer/guitarist pair of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], the song was primarily the work of Jagger, who wrote it sometime during the filming of ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' in 1969.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923165126/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 \"Jagger Remembers\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995 (accessed 25 April 2007).</ref> The song was written by Jagger with [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]], Jagger's secret girlfriend and mother of his first child Karis, in mind. It is also claimed it was written with [[Claudia Lennear]] in mind. Lennear claimed to be the song's subject on BBC's [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] (25 February 2014, ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]''), because she kept Jagger's company at the time when it was written.\n\n\"Brown Sugar\" was recorded over a three-day period at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], from 2 to 4 December 1969. The song was not released until over a year later due to legal wranglings with the band's former label. At the request of guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] (who had joined the band as [[Brian Jones]]' replacement in July of 1969), the Stones debuted the number live during the infamous concert at the [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont]] Speedway on 6 December 1969. \n\nIn the [[liner notes]] to the compilation album ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'' (1993), Jagger says, \"The lyric was all to do with the dual combination of drugs and girls. This song was a very instant thing, a definite high point\".<ref>Covach, John (2005), \"Form in Rock Music: A Primer\", in Stein, Deborah, ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', New York: Oxford University Press, p.74-75, {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}} .</ref>\n\nIn the ''Rolling Stone'' interview (14 December 1995, RS 723) Jagger spoke at length about the song, its inspiration and success, and taking credit for writing the lyrics. Keith Richards also credits Jagger with the song in his autobiography.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Life|last=Richards|first=Keith|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2010|isbn=978-0-316-03438-8|location=New York|pages=178}}</ref> He attributed the success of the song to a \"good groove\". After noting that the lyrics could mean so many lewd subjects,<ref>{{Citation|last=mayerson|first=hy|title=Metamorphosis|date=2019-03-09|url=https://vimeo.com/322545607|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> he again noted that the combination of those subjects, the lyrical ambiguity was partially why the song was considered successful. He noted, \"That makes it... the whole mess thrown in. God knows what I'm on about on that song. It's such a mishmash. All the nasty subjects in one go... I never would write that song now.\" When [[Jann Wenner|interviewer Jann Wenner]] asked him why, Jagger replied, \"I would probably censor myself. I'd think, 'Oh God, I can't. I've got to stop. I can't just write raw like that.{{'\"}}<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5/ \"Jagger Remembers\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205235627/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers/page/5 |date=5 December 2009 }}. ''Rolling Stone''. 14 December 1995.</ref>\n\nThe lyrical subject matter has often been a point of interest and controversy. Described by rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] as \"a rocker so compelling that it discourages [[exegesis]]\",<ref>[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php Robert Christgau \"Rolling Stones\"]. ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll''. 1976 (accessed 24 June 2007).</ref> \"Brown Sugar{{\"'}}s popularity indeed often overshadowed its scandalous lyrics, which were essentially a pastiche of a number of taboo subjects, including [[slavery]], rape, [[interracial sex]], [[cunnilingus]], [[sadomasochism]], lost [[virginity]] and [[heroin]].<ref>Unterberger, Richie. [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t3052783|pure_url=yes}} The Rolling Stones \"Brown Sugar\"].

It features appearances by [[Al Kooper]] on piano, and [[Eric Clapton]] on slide guitar. Richards considered releasing this version on ''Sticky Fingers'', mostly for its more spontaneous atmosphere, but decided on the original.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian McPherson |url=http://timeisonourside.com/SOBrown.html |title=Brown Sugar |website=Timeisonourside.com |date=1969-12-02 |accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref> The alternative version, which had previously been available only on [[bootleg recording]]s, was released in June 2015 on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions of the reissued ''Sticky Fingers'' album.\n\n==''Top of the Pops''==\nTo promote the song, the Rolling Stones performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the performance taped sometime around late March 1971, and being shown on 15 April and 6 May. They performed \"Brown Sugar\", \"[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" for the show's segment dedicated to albums, which was shown on 22 April 1971; due to BBC practices at the time, the performances were [[wiping|erased]] and all that remains is \"Brown Sugar\".\n\n==Release==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was eventually released in April 1971 as the first single from the album, becoming a number one hit in both the United States and Canada and a number two hit in both the United Kingdom and Ireland, and has since become a [[classic rock]] radio staple. While the US single featured only \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" as the B-side, the British single featured that track plus a live rendition of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]\", recorded at the [[University of Leeds]] during the 1971 tour of the United Kingdom. In the United States, ''Billboard'' ranked it as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1971|number 16 song for 1971]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was originally issued in mono using a now-rarely heard bespoke mono mix. This mono mix has never been used on any compilation.\n\nThe song was performed routinely during the Stones' [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1970|1970 European Tour]], occupying a prominent spot near the end of the [[set list]] even though audiences were unfamiliar with it. The band opened the shows of their infamous [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]] with \"Brown Sugar\", and it has become a Stones concert staple.\n\nWhen the Stones perform \"Brown Sugar\" live, Jagger often changes the lyrics from \"Just like a young girl should\" to \"Just like a young man should\". The line \"Hear him whip the women just around midnight\" is often changed to the less offensive \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight\". This is evident on their live albums ''[[Love You Live]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'', ''[[Live Licks]]'', ''[[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|Shine a Light]]'',''[[Stripped (The Rolling Stones album)#Totally Stripped|Totally Stripped]]'', and Voodoo Lounge Uncut. This change also occurs on the version recorded at Richards's birthday party. The Altamont debut of the song in December 1969 uses \"You shoulda heard him just around midnight.\" (Source: YouTube recordings). \n\nThe song is also the first single released on [[Rolling Stones Records]] (catalogue number RS-19100) and is one of the two Stones songs (along with \"Wild Horses\") licensed to both the band and former manager [[Allen Klein]] (a result of various business disagreements) resulting in its inclusion on the compilation album ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]''. \"Brown Sugar\" is also included on the most significant latter-day Rolling Stones compilations, ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'', ''[[Forty Licks]]'' and ''[[GRRR!]]''.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\"Brown Sugar\" was used prominently in the 1981 film ''[[Nighthawks (1981 film)|Nighthawks]]'' as background music for the scene in which New York police detectives played by [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] search a crowded disco for a terrorist ([[Rutger Hauer]]).\n\n[[Little Richard]] covered the song while he was signed to [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1971)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Austria|10|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Belgium (Flanders)|7|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Honky Tonk Women|chartid=5385|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Germany2|4|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|songid=191|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|2|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=18 June 2016}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20listener&qartistid=27#n_view_location |title=flavour of new zealand - search listener |website=Flavourofnz.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Norway|4|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Dutch100|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|South Africa<ref>http://www.rock.co.za/files/sa_charts_1969_1989_songs_(A-B).html</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|Spain Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Salaverri|first=Fernando|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st|date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Switzerland|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UKsinglesbyname|2|artist=Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=The Rolling Stones|song=Brown Sugar|accessdate=17 June 2016}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1971)\n!

Miles got Bill into the college concert band, Louis Schwab and his Illini Orioles under bandmaster [[Albert Austin Harding|Austin Harding]].\n\n===First road tour and nightclub===\nDuring summer vacation, Louis contacted King Richards and Bill took his first road trip to Wisconsin and Indiana. Fred Dexter, a music scout and musician at the Wisconsin Roof Gardens club, heard Bill play and hired him for his band. He played at a resort pavilion in Hudson Lake, Indiana.

[[#Further reading|''Cass Hagan'']] bought the band from Fred Dexter and Bill toured with them on college dates which included the [[#Further reading|''Pelham Heath Inn'']] in New York; it was run by the mob.

The band members were: George Stacey, trumpet (brother of altoist, [[Jack Stacey]], with [[Jimmy Dorsey]]), Frank Orchard, trombone; [[#Further reading|''Gene Schroeder'']], piano; [[Danny Alvin]], drums.{{sfn|Reinhardt|Coller|Whyatt|1993|loc= p.139}} In 1941 Bill played at the Crystal Caf\u00e9 (Brooklyn) and Club 18 (52nd St. New York City).\n\nIn the early 1940s Bill played with Frank Orchard, Bobby Hackett, Max Kaminsky, Wingy Manone and Joe Marsala.{{sfn|Leonard|Gitler|1999|loc=p.506}} Bill met his future wife, Ruth Sato, at the Forbidden City oriental nightclub on 58th Street in New York when they both were performing there.

Bill was the first musician to own a nightclub in Chicago.{{sfn| Rotzoll|2001}} It was well known for featuring some of the best jazz musicians in the country: [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Edmond Hall]], [[George Brunies]], [[Muggsy Spanier]], [[Baby Dodds]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Art Hodes]], [[Barrett Deems]], [[#Further reading|''Les Beigel'']]. Bill based the format of the club on Nick's in New York.{{sfn|Reinhardt|Coller|Whyatt |2003|loc=p.140}} His club was rare in keeping out the mob.  He invested his own money in Jazz, Ltd. and was co-owner, bandleader and played clarinet and saxophone. Ruth was the other co-owner, managed the club and did promotions. It was highly successful, operating from 1947 to 1972.  Jazz, Ltd. occasionally played concerts outside the club for charitable benefits and to sponsor the opening of other venues.\n\n==Managing the Jazz, Ltd. band==\nRuth said of her husband in an interview: Bill had a very difficult job on the bandstand. He holds the band together with the right tempo.{{sfn|Terkel|Reinhardt|1964}} \"...a square two-or four-beat to the measure for all and that's the way it's going to stay.\"\u2014Bill Reinhardt{{sfn|Lesner|1971}} Whenever another bandmember played an instrument with a reed, such as Sidney Bechet on soprano saxopohone, Bill used a different reed so as not to play the same notes as Sidney. Bill is the one who recruited the musicians to Jazz, Ltd., bringing talented ones to Chicago whom Chicagoans never heard of. There's so many different schools of jazz that you don't know what to play half the time, so you play by names of songs. When Bill wasn't managing the band at night he sold insurance during the day.{{sfn|Terkel|Reinhardt|1964}}\n\n==Playing style==\n\"Bill Reinhardt plays a beautifully fine clarinet...and he is the one that has kept the music even and full of integrity.\"{{sfn|Green|1965|loc=p.14D}} \"Bill Reinhardt plays clarinet in a warm, dirty style, reminiscent of [[Frank Teschemacher|Teschemacher]]...\"{{sfn|Schawlow|1947}} \"Bill was somewhat rigid in his presentation and format, I liked Bill's clarinet playing, particularly his ensemble and low register work. He knew how to play in the Dixieland/counterpoint ensemble which only a few clarinetists have mastered. His tempos were usually just right as he had the correct idea that this music should he danceable.\"{{sfn|Beebe|1994}} 'Reinhardt's dark and slightly acrid tone and his fluid, low-register choruses also mark him as a 'Chicago' stylist.\"{{sfn| Muranyi |1961}} Bill preferred the Selmer brand of clarinet (from France) and he was among the first to use a crystal mouthpiece.{{sfn|chilton1|1987|p.229}}{{sfn|coller|whyatt|1996}}\n\n==Interests and hobbies==\nBill enjoyed fishing, swimming, hunting, following the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[New York Yankees]] baseball, listening to \"The [[Lone Ranger]]\" and \"The Texas Rangers\" on the radio, and following the stock market for fun.{{sfn|Leonard(2)|1951}} In the 1930s his favorite job was working at Club 18 where he liked listening to [[Jackie Gleason]], Jack White, Frankie Hyers, and [[Joe Frisco]].{{sfn|anon_2|1955}}\n\n==Personality==\nBill was down-to-earth, mild mannered, humble and, by his own admission, vain. On one of the first fine bands he joined, he said of Fred Dexter, \"Why in the world he hired me I do not know; I couldn't blow my nose.\" Bill had a remarkable memory for people he played with and places he played at six decades earlier, recalling the year and the circumstances he was at each engagement.{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|Reinhardt|1992}} He earned respect for managing so many talented musicians, especially when multiple stars were in the same band and each wanted to lead.{{sfn|Reinhardt|Reinhardt|2009}} He was passionate about Dixieland. In the face of criticism from other bandmembers, Bill insisted that Dixieland was originally intended for dancing but in Chicago other musicians got hung up on Chicago style jazz, \"which as far as I'm concerned is a cop out! They just can't keep time.\"{{sfn| Reinhardt| Coller|Whyatt|1992}} Bill was a persausive negotiator. Many bandleaders were unable to convince Doc Evans to move from his home in Minneapolis to join their band but Bill was the only one who succeeded.{{sfn|Reinhardt|1947}} Evans played for Jazz, Ltd. for five years.{{sfn| Reinhardt| Coller|Whyatt|1992}} About 20% of the club's band members Bill recruited from out of state. Nothing serious phased him. Bill said nonchalantly, \"I began having problems with my ticker...drastic for some people but not for me,\" in reference to having angioplasty for an obstructed artery and a pacemaker for arrhythmia (when he was age 79).{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|Reinhardt|1992}} Bill frequently read reviews of his Jazz, Ltd. records in [[Down Beat]] jazz magazine.\n\n==After the club==\n[[File: Bill Reinhardt 071472 fr15a concert.jpg|thumb|right|Jazz, Ltd. band in Pioneer Court, Michigan Avenue, Chicago, July, 1972]] Bill Reinhardt continued the Jazz, Ltd. band after closing the club. He remained in Chicago for the next six years. Using his publicity from the club,  Bill's band played at numerous venues around Chicago until he found a long term engagement at [[#Further reading|''Flaming Sally's'']] nightclub in the [[Blackstone Hotel]] in Chicago for three years (1974-1977). He got sick and gave the Jazz, Ltd. band over to long time bandmember, Jim Beebe, who continued at the Blackstone Hotel for three more years.{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|1992}}{{sfn|Williams|2001}}\n\n==San Diego and final years==\nIn May 1978 Bill and Ruth moved to San Diego for the warmer climate. Bill played the Solana Beach Friday cocktail session one day a week and then quit after a disagreement on salary.\n\nIn 1981 bassist Bob Finch recruited Bill to help start a new jazz band at the Belly-Up Tavern in Solana Beach. When Bill insisted on Chicago style jazz, Ruth Reinhardt named the band 'The Chicago Six.' The other four bandmembers were Frank Chaddick, Bob Long, Phil Andreen and John Hall. Bill stayed with the band for three months until he fell and fractured his jaw, at which point Bill said, \"that was for all intents and purposes the end of my career.\" In 1982 the band dedicated their first album, ''Chicago Six Live at the Belly Up Tavern'', to Bill.{{sfn|Reinhardt_2|1994}}{{sfn|Hall|2016}}{{sfn|Hodges|1982}}\n\nIn 1987 Bill had angioplasty for an obstructed artery and a pacemaker installed to treat a heart arrhythmia. He was put on a permanent strict diet and continued walking the hills of San Diego for exercise.{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|1992}}\n\nWhen his wife, Ruth, died in 1992, Bill sold the rights to the Jazz, Ltd masters to [[Delmark Records]], run by [[Bob Koester]], an old friend in Chicago.{{sfn|Koester|2001}}\nIn the early 1990s, when Bill developed Dementia and Parkinson's disease, [[#Further reading|Harlow Atwood]], a 63-year friend of Bill's, persuaded Patricia Hughes to leave her job in Arkansas and care for him. She struck up a close friendship with Bill via letters and phone conversations starting in January, 1994.{{sfn|reinhardt_3|1994}} He was 86 and she was 43, when \"I married him to keep him out of a nursing home\" Patrica said. She cared for him at home, and \"he was my best friend.\"{{sfn| Rotzoll|2001|loc=p.71}} Bill proclaimed of Pat, \"I'm just on cloud # 9 \u2013 she is a wonderful girl and far out of any expectation I might have had.\"{{sfn|Reinhardt_4|1995}} By 1994 he lost the tonality of his hearing and could no longer play the clarinet.{{sfn|Reinhardt_5|1994}}\n\nIn February 1998 Bill was mugged while jogging. He suffered a fractured pelvis and was cut with a knife, recovering by the end of the year.{{sfn|Koester|2001}} He died at home of cardiac arrest on Jan. 23, 2001 at the age of 92.{{sfn|Babikian|2001}} He is [[#Further reading|interred]] at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=24em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite journal |

Bill was the first musician to own a nightclub in Chicago.{{sfn| Rotzoll|2001}} It was well known for featuring some of the best jazz musicians in the country: [[Sidney Bechet]], [[Edmond Hall]], [[George Brunies]], [[Muggsy Spanier]], [[Baby Dodds]], [[Jack Teagarden]], [[Art Hodes]], [[Barrett Deems]], [[#Further reading|''Les Beigel'']]. Bill based the format of the club on Nick's in New York.{{sfn|Reinhardt|Coller|Whyatt |2003|loc=p.140}} His club was rare in keeping out the mob.  He invested his own money in Jazz, Ltd. and was co-owner, bandleader and played clarinet and saxophone. Ruth was the other co-owner, managed the club and did promotions. It was highly successful, operating from 1947 to 1972.  Jazz, Ltd. occasionally played concerts outside the club for charitable benefits and to sponsor the opening of other venues.\n\n==Managing the Jazz, Ltd. band==\nRuth said of her husband in an interview: Bill had a very difficult job on the bandstand. He holds the band together with the right tempo.{{sfn|Terkel|Reinhardt|1964}} \"...a square two-or four-beat to the measure for all and that's the way it's going to stay.\"\u2014Bill Reinhardt{{sfn|Lesner|1971}} Whenever another bandmember played an instrument with a reed, such as Sidney Bechet on soprano saxopohone, Bill used a different reed so as not to play the same notes as Sidney. Bill is the one who recruited the musicians to Jazz, Ltd., bringing talented ones to Chicago whom Chicagoans never heard of. There's so many different schools of jazz that you don't know what to play half the time, so you play by names of songs. When Bill wasn't managing the band at night he sold insurance during the day.{{sfn|Terkel|Reinhardt|1964}}\n\n==Playing style==\n\"Bill Reinhardt plays a beautifully fine clarinet...and he is the one that has kept the music even and full of integrity.\"{{sfn|Green|1965|loc=p.14D}} \"Bill Reinhardt plays clarinet in a warm, dirty style, reminiscent of [[Frank Teschemacher|Teschemacher]]...\"{{sfn|Schawlow|1947}} \"Bill was somewhat rigid in his presentation and format, I liked Bill's clarinet playing, particularly his ensemble and low register work. He knew how to play in the Dixieland/counterpoint ensemble which only a few clarinetists have mastered. His tempos were usually just right as he had the correct idea that this music should he danceable.\"{{sfn|Beebe|1994}} 'Reinhardt's dark and slightly acrid tone and his fluid, low-register choruses also mark him as a 'Chicago' stylist.\"{{sfn| Muranyi |1961}} Bill preferred the Selmer brand of clarinet (from France) and he was among the first to use a crystal mouthpiece.{{sfn|chilton1|1987|p.229}}{{sfn|coller|whyatt|1996}}\n\n==Interests and hobbies==\nBill enjoyed fishing, swimming, hunting, following the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[New York Yankees]] baseball, listening to \"The [[Lone Ranger]]\" and \"The Texas Rangers\" on the radio, and following the stock market for fun.{{sfn|Leonard(2)|1951}} In the 1930s his favorite job was working at Club 18 where he liked listening to [[Jackie Gleason]], Jack White, Frankie Hyers, and [[Joe Frisco]].{{sfn|anon_2|1955}}\n\n==Personality==\nBill was down-to-earth, mild mannered, humble and, by his own admission, vain. On one of the first fine bands he joined, he said of Fred Dexter, \"Why in the world he hired me I do not know; I couldn't blow my nose.\" Bill had a remarkable memory for people he played with and places he played at six decades earlier, recalling the year and the circumstances he was at each engagement.{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|Reinhardt|1992}} He earned respect for managing so many talented musicians, especially when multiple stars were in the same band and each wanted to lead.{{sfn|Reinhardt|Reinhardt|2009}} He was passionate about Dixieland. In the face of criticism from other bandmembers, Bill insisted that Dixieland was originally intended for dancing but in Chicago other musicians got hung up on Chicago style jazz, \"which as far as I'm concerned is a cop out! They just can't keep time.\"{{sfn| Reinhardt| Coller|Whyatt|1992}} Bill was a persausive negotiator. Many bandleaders were unable to convince Doc Evans to move from his home in Minneapolis to join their band but Bill was the only one who succeeded.{{sfn|Reinhardt|1947}} Evans played for Jazz, Ltd. for five years.{{sfn| Reinhardt| Coller|Whyatt|1992}} About 20% of the club's band members Bill recruited from out of state. Nothing serious phased him. Bill said nonchalantly, \"I began having problems with my ticker...drastic for some people but not for me,\" in reference to having angioplasty for an obstructed artery and a pacemaker for arrhythmia (when he was age 79).{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|Reinhardt|1992}} Bill frequently read reviews of his Jazz, Ltd. records in [[Down Beat]] jazz magazine.\n\n==After the club==\n[[File: Bill Reinhardt 071472 fr15a concert.jpg|thumb|right|Jazz, Ltd. band in Pioneer Court, Michigan Avenue, Chicago, July, 1972]] Bill Reinhardt continued the Jazz, Ltd. band after closing the club. He remained in Chicago for the next six years. Using his publicity from the club,  Bill's band played at numerous venues around Chicago until he found a long term engagement at [[#Further reading|''Flaming Sally's'']] nightclub in the [[Blackstone Hotel]] in Chicago for three years (1974-1977). He got sick and gave the Jazz, Ltd. band over to long time bandmember, Jim Beebe, who continued at the Blackstone Hotel for three more years.{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|1992}}{{sfn|Williams|2001}}\n\n==San Diego and final years==\nIn May 1978 Bill and Ruth moved to San Diego for the warmer climate. Bill played the Solana Beach Friday cocktail session one day a week and then quit after a disagreement on salary.\n\nIn 1981 bassist Bob Finch recruited Bill to help start a new jazz band at the Belly-Up Tavern in Solana Beach. When Bill insisted on Chicago style jazz, Ruth Reinhardt named the band 'The Chicago Six.' The other four bandmembers were Frank Chaddick, Bob Long, Phil Andreen and John Hall. Bill stayed with the band for three months until he fell and fractured his jaw, at which point Bill said, \"that was for all intents and purposes the end of my career.\" In 1982 the band dedicated their first album, ''Chicago Six Live at the Belly Up Tavern'', to Bill.{{sfn|Reinhardt_2|1994}}{{sfn|Hall|2016}}{{sfn|Hodges|1982}}\n\nIn 1987 Bill had angioplasty for an obstructed artery and a pacemaker installed to treat a heart arrhythmia. He was put on a permanent strict diet and continued walking the hills of San Diego for exercise.{{sfn|Coller|Whyatt|1992}}\n\nWhen his wife, Ruth, died in 1992, Bill sold the rights to the Jazz, Ltd masters to [[Delmark Records]], run by [[Bob Koester]], an old friend in Chicago.{{sfn|Koester|2001}}\nIn the early 1990s, when Bill developed Dementia and Parkinson's disease, [[#Further reading|Harlow Atwood]], a 63-year friend of Bill's, persuaded Patricia Hughes to leave her job in Arkansas and care for him. She struck up a close friendship with Bill via letters and phone conversations starting in January, 1994.{{sfn|reinhardt_3|1994}} He was 86 and she was 43, when \"I married him to keep him out of a nursing home\" Patrica said. She cared for him at home, and \"he was my best friend.\"{{sfn| Rotzoll|2001|loc=p.71}} Bill proclaimed of Pat, \"I'm just on cloud # 9 \u2013 she is a wonderful girl and far out of any expectation I might have had.\"{{sfn|Reinhardt_4|1995}} By 1994 he lost the tonality of his hearing and could no longer play the clarinet.{{sfn|Reinhardt_5|1994}}\n\nIn February 1998 Bill was mugged while jogging. He suffered a fractured pelvis and was cut with a knife, recovering by the end of the year.{{sfn|Koester|2001}} He died at home of cardiac arrest on Jan. 23, 2001 at the age of 92.{{sfn|Babikian|2001}} He is [[#Further reading|interred]] at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=24em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite journal |

In 1991, she made her solo debut with the number-one single \"She Is His Only Need\". Overall, ''Wynonna'' produced four chart singles, including two more Number Ones, and it was certified 5&times; Platinum by the [[RIAA]]. Her second and third albums, 1993's ''Tell Me Why'' and 1996's ''Revelations'', also saw platinum certification each, as well as five Top Tens from the former and a Number One from the latter. None of the singles from her next three albums (1997's ''The Other Side'', 2000's ''New Day Dawning'', or 2003's ''What The World Needs Now Is Love'') reached Top Ten, however. She and Naomi briefly reunited for a special compilation disc included on ''New Day Dawning''. Naomi also sang guest vocals on \"Flies on the Butter\", a single from ''What The World Needs Now Is Love'', which was credited to Wynonna with Naomi Judd.\n\n==Studio albums==\n\n===1990s===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
