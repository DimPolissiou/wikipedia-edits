As such, he was also deployed as a second striker or as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central]] [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] on occasion. He was also an accurate [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] taker. Furthermore, his stature, combined with his long hair and beard, made him a highly recognisable figure on the pitch.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name=\"CdS\">{{cite news |url=https://www.corriere.it/sport/20_aprile_05/casagrande-dall-ascoli-droga-libri-cosi-ho-battuto-l-inferno-4ef90f68-7732-11ea-9a9a-6cb2a51f0129.shtml |title=Casagrande, dall\u2019Ascoli alla droga e ai libri: \u00abCos\u00ec ho battuto l\u2019inferno\u00bb |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=Italian |date=5 April 2020 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"repubblica1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/torino/2017/04/27/news/casagrande_alcol_droga-163999465/ |title=Walter Casagrande: ''Cos\u00ec ho sconfitto i miei demoni'' |work=La Repubblica |language=Italian |last1=Gamba |first1=Emanuele |date=27 April 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"calciomercato\">{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/casagrande-l-ascoli-nel-cuore-la-scommessa-con-rozzi-la-doppiett-69246 |title=Casagrande: l'Ascoli nel cuore, la scommessa con Rozzi, la doppietta alla Juve e la droga... |publisher=www.calciomercato.com |language=Italian |last1=Gandolfi |first1=Remo |date=4 November 2019 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"ilfattoquotidiano1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/04/03/ti-ricordi-quando-il-toro-di-mondonico-batte-la-juve-nel-derby-davanti-a-kissinger/5759029/ |title=Ti ricordi\u2026 Quando il Toro di Mondonico batt\u00e9 la Juve nel derby davanti a Kissinger |work=Il Fatto Quotidiano |language=Italian |last1=Vella |first1=Cristiano |date=3 April 2020 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"CdSp\">{{cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/italy/corriere-dello-sport/20140629/281724087642058 |title=Casagrande c'\u00e8 vita oltre i demoni |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |page=11 |language=Italian |date=29 June 2014 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"toro.it\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toro.it/rubriche/pillole-storia/15-aprile-1963-nasce-walter-casagrande/208932/ |title=15 aprile 1963: nasce Walter Casagrande |publisher=Toro.it |language=Italian |last1=Milano |first1=Fabio |date=15 April 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"toronews2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronews.net/mondo-granata/walter-casagrande-e-le-doppiette-storiche-contro-juve-e-ajax/ |title=Walter Casagrande, le doppiette storiche contro Juventus e Ajax |publisher=Toro News |language=Italian |last1=De Rito |first1=Marco |date=15 April 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"toronews3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.toronews.net/toro/fame-di-gol/ |title=Fame di gol |publisher=Toro News |language=Italian |last1=Ferrero |first1=Michele |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=9 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/mexico-1986-part-500906.pdf?cloudid=vkami8gmuo9mpkbuzfhs |title=Mexico 1986 |publisher=FIFA.com |accessdate=9 April 2020 }}</ref>|name=\"playing-style\"|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing his retirement from professional football, Casagrande worked as an analyst.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/paris-saint-germain/story/3385178/neymar-sr-hits-back-at-after-spoiled-and-a-monster?src=com |title=Casagrande calls 'spoiled' Neymar 'a monster,' Neymar Sr. hits back |publisher=ESPN FC |date=15 February 2018 |accessdate=6 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2007, Casagrande was involved in a weekend traffic accident, and was briefly in a coma after his car rolled and hit parked cars.

While in certain subjects such as Mathematics, students are only required to study the Compulsory Part, while the Elective Modules are voluntary. As such, an Elective Part forms a part the subject curriculum, whereas an Extended module is designed for students with specific aim(s) or those who have higher abilities who may want additional knowledge and skills. The selection of offerings for both Elective Parts and Modules vary from school to school, for example, some schools offer both M1 (Extended Module 1) and M2 for Mathematics, while others may offer only the Compulsory Part.\n* Elective Part Example: English. The Elective Part of the English Language curriculum takes up 25% of total lesson time. The selection of Elective Parts is divided into two areas: \"Language Arts\" and \"Non-Language Arts\", each of which teaches English as used in different contexts and through various medium.<ref name=English>{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |title=English Language Curriculum and Assessment Guide |work=EMB: Senior Secondary Curriculum and Assessment Guides (Final Version) |publisher=Curriculum Development Council and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority |accessdate=2007-06-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130656/http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}</ref> During HKDSE, candidates also have the choice to write either the higher level (B2) or the standard level (B1) part of the paper, in addition to the mandatory Part A.

Speaking (Oral) components and examinations for certain Category B (Applied Learning) subjects are administered earlier. Category C (Other Languages) subjects usually take place in June (French and Spanish may be taken in the previous November), inline with CAIE AS-level practise.\n\nBefore the exam, candidates have a chance to become familiar with the different level descriptors and samples and may use them as objectives for their study. Also, they can also familiarise with the exam requirement by doing DSE Past Paper. When results are released, candidates can have a clearer picture of their attainment level. Thus, tertiary institutions and employers also have more accurate and robust information for admission or recruitment purposes.\n\n==Subjects==\nHKDSE subjects are offered in three different categories, including 24 in Category A: NSS (Traditional), over 40 in Category B: ApL (Applied Learning) and six in Category C: Other Languages.\n\n===Category A: New Senior Secondary Subjects===\nCategory A subjects are traditional school subjects. Exams in this category are held directly by HKEAA. Both Core Subjects (Compulsory for University Admission) and Elective Subjects fall under Category A.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/HKDSE/assessment/subject_information/category_a_subjects/|title=Category A: Senior Secondary Subjects - HKDSE|website=www.hkeaa.edu.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref> Results of these subjects are generally accepted for local and international university admission.\n\nFor Mathematics, levels of the Extended Modules (M1 and M2) are listed separately on the certificates.\n\n'''Core subjects'''\n* [[Chinese Language]]\n* [[English Language]]\n* [[Mathematics]]\n* [[Liberal Studies]]\n\nFor Mathematics, in addition to the Compulsory Part, candidates may take one of the following Extended Modules:\n* Module 1 (\"M1\", [[Calculus]] and [[Statistics]]).\n* Module 2 (\"M2\", [[Algebra]] and [[Calculus]]).\n\nFor Liberal Studies, the subject curriculum features six Modules, including:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://334.edb.hkedcity.net/doc/eng/curriculum/LS%20C&A%20Guide_updated_e.pdf|title=Liberal Studies - Curriculum and Assessment Guide (Secondary 4 - 6)|website=Curriculum Development Council and The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref>\n* \"Personal Development and Interpersonal Relationships.\"\n* \"Hong Kong Today.\"\n* \"Modern China.\"\n* \"Globalization.\"\n* \"Public Health.\"\n* \"Energy Technology and the Environment.\"\n\nHowever, save in very particular cases and as determined by institutions, a pass in an Extended Part of a subject cannot substitute a pass in the Compulsory Part for university admission, especially when applying through JUPAS for [[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|UGC]]-funded courses.\n\n'''Electives'''\n\nStudents can choose one to four electives among 20 Elective Subjects according to their interests and strengths. However, most schools do not offer a full selection of the 20 subjects in their curriculum due to practical limitations.\n\nAccording to the Registration Statistics for 2018 released by the HKEAA, the most chosen subject is Physics, with a total of 11,658 candidates.

Assessments of these subjects are conducted by the course providers, and the results reported to the HKEAA for adjustment. They are mostly vocational or professional subjects.\n\nApplied Learning Subjects may or may not be considered by tertiary institutions for admission, according to HKEAA, a reported level of \"Attained\" on the certificate is considered as equivalent to a Grade 2 in a Category A subject, and \"Attained with Distinction\" to Grade 3 or above. From 2018, \"Attained with Distinction\" has been further refined to \"Attained with Distinction (I)\" (equivalent to Grade 3) and \"Attained with Distinction (II)\" (equivalent to Grade 4 or above). However, the more prestigious universities in Hong Kong usually consider Category B subjects as mere 'Interest Groups' for admission purposes, believing them to be inferior to the traditional academic subjects in Category A.\n\nAreas of study in Category B include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/HKDSE/assessment/subject_information/category_b_subjects/|title=Category B: Applied Learning Subjects - HKDSE|website=www.hkeaa.edu.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|\n* Creative Studies\n* Media and Communication\n* Business, Management and Law\n* Services\n* Applied Science\n* Engineering and Production\n* Applied Learning Chinese (for non-Chinese speaking students)\n}}\n\n===Category C: Other Language Subjects===\nThese are language electives. They may be used to replace Chinese Language for university admissions for students whose first language is not Chinese, but it may not be used to replace English. It may also be chosen as an elective for native Chinese speaking students, in which case it will not serve as an alternative language for UG admission. In many cases, in lieu of a Category C subject, an [[IGCSE]] Chinese Language pass (or similar Chinese qualification) can also be accepted for admission to UG programmes for non-Chinese speaking students.\n\nCategory C subjects use the papers of [[Cambridge Assessment International Education|CAIE]] [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE AS-level]] language subjects.

The elective or extended part is a \"module\" of a student's choice, and concentrates on a specific topic or skill. An elective module is an integral component of the standard curriculum, while an extended module is designed for students with specific aim(s) or those who have higher ability(ies) who may want additional knowledge and skills.\n* Elective Part Example: The elective part of the HKDSE English Language curriculum takes up 25% of the lesson time. Modules in the elective part are divided in two groups: \"Language Arts\" and \"Non-Language Arts\", both of which are about learning English in different contexts and media.<ref name=English>{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |title=English Language Curriculum and Assessment Guide |work=EMB: Senior Secondary Curriculum and Assessment Guides (Final Version) |publisher=Curriculum Development Council and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority |accessdate=2007-06-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130656/http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_5999/eng_lang_final.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}</ref> During the examination, candidates can choose to write a higher level (Paper B2) or a standard level (Paper B1) paper.

Oral examinations and some other subjects are administered earlier.  Testing for Category C subjects takes place in June; French and Spanish may be taken the previous November. Category B subjects do not have an oral examination.\n\nBefore the exam, candidates have a chance to become familiar with the different level descriptors and samples and may use them as objectives for their study. Also, they can also familiarise with the exam requirement by doing DSE Past Paper. When results are released, candidates can have a clearer picture of their attainment level. Thus, tertiary institutions and employers also have more accurate and robust information for admission or recruitment purposes.\n\n==Subjects==\nThe HKDSE is divided into three different categories, including 24 senior secondary subjects, over 40 applied learning subjects and six other language subjects.\n\n===Category A: New Senior Secondary Subjects===\nCategory A subjects are traditional school subjects and their exams are administered by HKEAA.

They are vocational-oriented subjects to satisfy the needs of employers.\n\nApplied Learning Subjects may be used by tertiary institutes for admission purposes, in which case it is seen as the equivalent of achieving a Grade 2 in a traditional elective subject for a subject status of \"Attained\" and Grade 3 or above for \"Attained with Distinction\". Starting from 2018, \"Attained with Distinction\" is further refined to \"Attained with Distinction (I)\" (equivalent to Grade 3) and \"Attained with Distinction (II)\" (equivalent to Grade 4 or above).

In some cases, instead of a Category C subject, an [[IGCSE]] Chinese Language pass (or similar Chinese qualification) is required for admission in some institutes for non-Chinese speaking students.\n\nCategory C subjects adopt the same paper as the [[General Certificate of Education]] AS-level.

Due to the differences between the local and international qualifications, there has been a considerable amount of concern over the emergence of a bipartite education system, based on wealth instead of merit. However, students with only international exams results cannot apply through JUPAS, which accounts for a higher portion of admissions to undergraduate programmes in terms of total intake.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Impact on schools==\nOne notable impact on schools in [[Hong Kong]] is the discontinued need for [[sixth form college]]s due to the cancellation of HKALE and 7th form. Nevertheless, some of these colleges, such as [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]], remain in operation as senior secondary schools.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Unbalanced focus===\nThe HKDSE is criticized for placing too much emphasis on the four core subjects, causing some students to neglect the elective subjects. [[Tsui Lap-chee]], president of the University of Hong Kong at the time of the introduction of HKDSE, said that: \"The Education Bureau demands universities [to screen pupils by] setting the so-called ''3322'' as minimum entry requirement for undergraduate programmes \u2014 a minimal of grade 3 in Chinese Language and English Language, and a minimal of grade 2 in Mathematics and Liberal Studies. [It is] insufficient for studying in universities.\" He proposed a minimal grade requirement for two elective subjects, which the Education Bureau rejected. He also mentioned that many students do not study the optional extended modules for Mathematics, leaving them lacking the advanced mathematics knowledge needed for science and engineering studies; it is very difficult for them to make this up in their undergraduate courses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://topick.hket.com/article/1875385/%E6%96%87%E6%86%91%E8%A9%A63322%E4%B8%8D%E8%B6%B3%E4%B8%8A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%20%E5%BE%90%E7%AB%8B%E4%B9%8B%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%B1%80%E5%A6%82%E5%90%8C%E6%94%9E%E6%A7%8D%E8%BF%AB%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97|title=\u6587\u6191\u8a663322\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0a\u5927\u5b78 \u5f90\u7acb\u4e4b\uff1a\u6559\u80b2\u5c40\u5982\u540c\u651e\u69cd\u8feb\u5927\u5b78\u63a5\u53d7|publisher=Hong Kong Economic Times|language=zh|date=8 August 2017|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Hindrance to admission===\nSince the launch of the HKDSE, the Chinese language paper is often dubbed the \"paper of death\" (Chinese: \u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e4b\u5377).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://yp.scmp.com/education/article/105960/year%E2%80%99s-hkdse-chinese-exam-was-lively-%E2%80%9Cpaper-death%E2%80%9D|title=This year\u2019s HKDSE Chinese exam was a lively \"paper of death\"|work=Young Post {{!}} South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> Some have the opinion that the high expectation is well-founded since Cantonese Chinese is the daily language of Hong Kong, but every year nearly half of all candidates fail the subject.

Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung said that all oral and practical examinations to be held before March 27 will be postponed. He went on further to mention two different options  considered by the Bureau and the Hong Kong Examinations & Assessment Authority. Option one stated that written exams would take place on March 27 as scheduled, whereas physical education and music practical exams and the Chinese oral exams would be postponed to May. Option two stated that all examinations would be postponed by four weeks, as well as cancelling all oral examinations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200206/20200206_150218_291.html|title=New HKDSE plan to be announced|website=Hong Kong's Information Services Department|language=zh-hk|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> At the end of February, the bureau announced that option one would be adopted where HKDSE will be held as schedule on March 27 and Chinese oral exams will be postponed to May 18.

Some measures were made by the Bureau to prevent the chance of virus transmission, such as all candidates will be provided a mask when entering the examination venue and their body temperature will be checked. For those who could not attend HKDSE due to heath condition, their final grade of the subject can be determined based on school performance, but the maximum grade they can obtained will be level 5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestandnews.com/society/%E5%85%A8%E6%B8%AF%E5%AD%B8%E6%A0%A1%E6%9C%80%E6%97%A9-4-%E6%9C%88-20-%E5%BE%A9%E8%AA%B2-%E6%96%87%E6%86%91%E8%A9%A6%E5%B0%87%E5%A6%82%E6%9C%9F%E9%96%8B%E8%80%83-%E9%A0%86%E5%BB%B6%E4%B8%80%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E6%94%BE%E6%A6%9C/|title=\u5168\u6e2f\u5b78\u6821\u6700\u65e9 4 \u6708 20 \u5fa9\u8ab2 \u6587\u6191\u8a66\u5c07\u5982\u671f\u958b\u8003 \u9806\u5ef6\u4e00\u661f\u671f\u653e\u699c {{!}} \u7acb\u5834\u5831\u9053 {{!}} \u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e|website=\u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e Stand News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> \n\nCandidates this year expressed dissatisfaction on the new arrangements.

There are various theories about the origin of the word Khandesh. One theory states that the name derives from the words \"[[Khan (title)|Khan]]\" (a title used by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] deputies in the region) and \"desh\" (country). Another theory suggests the name derives from the words \"Kanha\" and \"desh\"; \"Kanha\" is a name for Krishna, the primary deity worshipped by the [[Ahir]] people of the region. Other theories suggests the varying origins of the word \"Khan\", including \"''Kanbai''\" (a regional female deity), \"''Kahan''\" (hay or grass) and \"''Khaan''\" (\"basin\", as in basin of the [[Waghur river]]). A detailed study of the various etymologies of the word Khandesh appears in the book ''Ahirani Boli'' by Dr. Ramesh Suryawanshi.\n\n== Dialects ==\n\n'''Ahirani''' is a major dialect of Khandeshi. It was originally spoken by the [[Ahir]]s (Epic cattle herders) living in the Khandesh region. It is further divided into region-based sub-dialects such as [[Chalisgaon|Chalisgaon, Dhule]], Malegaon and Dhule group. Ahirani is spoken in the [[Jalgaon district|Jalgaon]] (except Bhusaval, Jamner, Bodwad and Muktainagar) and [[Nandurbar district|Nandurbar]], [[Dhule district|Dhule]]. Outside Khandesh, it is spoken in some parts of [[Nashik district|Nashik]] (Baglan, Malegaon and Kalwan tehsils) and Aurangabad. People in the [[tehsils]] of [[Dharangaon]], [[Chopda]], [[Amalner]], [[Sakri]], [[Sindkheda]], [[Dondaicha-Warwade]], [[Shirpur]], [[Taloda]], [[Shahada]], [[Dhadgaon]], [[Akkalkuwa]], [[Navapur]], [[Raver, Maharashtra|Raver]], [[Parola]], [[Erandol]], [[Satana, India]], [[Malegaon]], [[Baglan Taluka|Baglan]] also speak Ahirani. In the neighboring state of [[Gujarat]], it is spoken in [[Surat]] and [[Vyara]], and in [[Madhya Pradesh Burhanpur]], Ahirani is spoken in and around [[Amba-Varla]]. Research by Dr. Ramesh Suryawashi suggests that the Ahirani dialect is also spoken in [[Dharni, Amravati|Dharni tehsil]] of [[Amravati district]], around the [[Melghat Tiger Reserve]] forest area. But it is known as ''Gavali Boli'' there. Around 30-35 thousand people speak Gavai boli in 40 villages.\n\nAccording to the 1971 census of India, the number of people who declared Ahirani as their mother tongue was 363,780. A 2011 estimate of the population of the Dhulia, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts, and the Ahirani speaker tehsils of Aurangabad and Nasik district was 10 million.\n\nThe non-Ahirs in the region (such as Lewa, Wani, Bhill and Pardeshi castes) started speaking variants of Ahirani mixed with their dialects while interacting with the Ahirs, which led to the birth of other dialects of the language. Chandwadi is spoken around Chandwad hills, Nandubari is spoken around Nandurbar, Jamnerior Tawadi is spoken around Jamner tehsil, Taptangi is spoken by the side of Tapi, Tapti river. Dongarangi is spoken by the side of forest Ajanta hills. All these are region-based names for Khandeshi sub-dialects. Ahirani, Gujar, Bhilau, Maharau, Lewa and Purbhi all are social (caste-based) categories of Khandeshi. Several castes speak their own dialect at home but use Khandeshi for their daily communication outside their communities.\n\nThe people residing in Nandurbar region of Maha-Gujrat border speak a dialect named as Gujar which is very different from ahirani and close to Gujrathi. These language also used in community and at market places at many towns such as Shahada,Taloda,Mhasawad etc.\n\n== Grammar and vocabulary ==\n\nThe Standard [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and Ahirani show considerable difference at various levels of structures. This indicates that the source and development of these two dialects are independent. Some of the peculiarities of Ahirani show closeness to Rajashthani and Gujarati. \n\nBorrowing and bending the words from [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Ahirani has created its own words not found in any of these languages. Ahirani is basically in colloquial form and uses the [[Devanagari]] script for its writing.\n\nEducated Khandeshis speak standard Marathi as well as Ahirani. In the urban areas, Ahirani is losing its popularity among such people to standard Marathi, but in the rural areas, Ahirani dominates. The language is widely used among the farmers and villagers. It is also known for its secret words used by goldsmiths, cattle sellers, fruit-purchasers, known only to the members of that community.\n\n== Literature ==\n\nBeing a rural language, Ahirani has not produced much literature. [[Bahinabai Chaudhari]] (1880-1951) is a well-known poet of Khandesh, and the study of her literature is studied and included in Marathi language sources. The language in her poems is different from Ahirani, but influenced by Ahirani. Some say the poet is not Ahirani, but Lewa (a dialect of Khandeshi).\n\n== Linguistic research ==\n\nDr. RameshSitaram Suryawanshi has authored following works on Ahirani:\n\n* ''Ahirani Bhasha Vaidnynik Abhyasa'' (1997), a linguistic study, which explains the grammar formation of words and formation of sentences in Ahirani.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims.\n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Prior to 2019, several laws to transfer jurisdiction to the Parks Department had been proposed to ease public access to Hart Island.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are numerous theories about the possible origins for the islands name.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims.\n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, has tried to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available.

The [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] (USOPC) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] for the United States.\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals (1,022 of them gold) at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 305 at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when [[Athens]] hosted the very first [[1896 Summer Olympics|edition]] of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-[[World War I|WW1]] period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the [[interwar period]], America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], when [[Berlin]] hosted the games, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] when [[World War II|WW2]] hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its places being taken by the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. After that, the US would not top a medal table in a non-boycotted games until [[1996 Summer Olympics]], five years after the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|collapsed]]. The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], USSR's [[satellite state]]. The only bright spot was the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott]]. In the 1990s, the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions. \n\nContrary to its Summer Olympics status, America was never really considered a power in the Winter Games until the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. Therefore, its greatest achievements in the 20th century are more tied to specific events, rather than overall performances. However, hosting the games in 2002 gave a much needed boost to the US winter sports program, and since then the country performed consistently, never placing below fourth in the medal count, although America's performance has steadily declined since winning the most medals at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], with the US winning only 23 medals at the most recent [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Games]] in [[Pyeongchang]] compared to 37 in 2010.\n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U.

Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the [[Cold War]], and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014]] and [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election|2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5164194/usa-russia-olympics-hockey/|title=USA Men's Team Vs.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States.

The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when [[Athens]] hosted the very first [[1896 Summer Olympics|edition]] of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-[[World War I|WW1]] period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the [[interwar period]], America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], when [[Berlin]] hosted the games, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] when [[World War II|WW2]] hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its places being taken by the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. After that, the US would not top a medal table in a non-boycotted games until [[1996 Summer Olympics]], five years after the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|collapsed]]. The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], USSR's [[satellite state]]. The only bright spot was the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott]]. In the 1990s the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions. \n\nContrary to its Summer Olympics status, America was never really considered a power in the Winter Games until the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. Therefore, its greatest achievements in the 20th century are more tied to specific events, rather than overall performances. However, hosting the games in 2002 gave a much needed boost to the US winter sports program, and since then the country performed consistently, never placing below fourth in the medal count, although America's performance has steadily declined since winning the most medals at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], with the US winning only 23 medals at the most recent [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Games]] in [[Pyeongchang]] compared to 37 in 2010.\n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17.

The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U. Tulli, \"Bringing Human Rights In: The Campaign Against the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games and the Origins of the Nexus Between Human Rights and the Olympic Games\", in The International Journal of the History of Sport, Vol.33, Issue 16 (2016-2017) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523367.2017.1315104</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/qfp/104481.htm|title=The Olympic Boycott, 1980|work=U.S. Department of State Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/01.20.html|title=The President Said Nyet|work=The New York Times|author=Smith, Terence|date=January 20, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0415/041531.html|title=How the Russians break the Olympic rules|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to '84 Olympics|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2002/JSH2903/jsh2903ag.pdf \u00ab03 Seconds From Gold\u00bb (2002).] \u00abJournal of Sports History\u00bb (vol 29, issue 3, page 518\u2014522) // la84foundation.org</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|United States team]] was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Spdslecturer", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics"}
