The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. [[Death Valley]], a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world,<ref name=newRecord>{{cite journal|last=El Fadli|first=K.

The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"VICE\" /> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC20170127\"/>\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.

Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|\"California 100 Company\"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general.

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

The two rivers join in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], flowing into the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].\n\nThe [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].\n\n===Regions===\n\n{{further|List of regions of California|List of places in

The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \"very important\", compared to 56 percent nationally.<ref name=\"Helfland 2008\">{{cite news |last=Helfand |first=Duke |title=State has a relaxed view on religion\u2014Survey finds Californians are less certain about the existence of God than others in the U.S |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 24, 2008 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/local/me-faith24 |access-date=December 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n\n{{Main|Sports in California|List of professional sports teams in California}}\n\nCalifornia has nineteen [[major professional sports league]] franchises, far more than any other state.

The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"VICE\" /> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC20170127\"/>\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.

He also experiments with a [[Cutter (baseball)|cutter]] in the mid 80's for some extra movement to induce ground balls or surprise hitters. His primary off-speed pitch to lefties is the changeup and to righties is the curveball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brooksbaseball.net/player_cards/player_card.php?player=571666|title=Brooks Baseball \u00b7 Home of the PitchFX Tool \u2013 Player Card: Michael Fiers|publisher=Brooks Baseball|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> His changeup is considered by many to be his best pitch, and he has excellent command of the strikezone with all of his pitches. Despite having relatively low velocity, his command, the movement of his pitches (particularly his slow, looping curveball) all make him quite capable of racking up strikeouts. He had a K/9 of 9.6 during his four years in the minors, and has a respectable K/9 of 8.4 in the majors.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography|Baseball}}\n{{baseballstats|mlb=571666|espn=30773|br=f/fiersmi01|fangraphs=sa502128|brm=fiers-001mic|retro=F/Pfierm001}}\n*{{Twitter}}\n:<br>\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|ach}}\n{{Succession box | title  = [[No-hitter]] pitcher | years  = August 21, 2015<br />May 7, 2019 | before = [[Hisashi Iwakuma]]<br />[[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] | after = [[Jake Arrieta]]<br />[[Taylor Cole (baseball)|Taylor Cole]], [[Felix Pe\u00f1a]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Oakland Athletics roster navbox}}\n{{Oakland Athletics Opening Day starting pitchers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fiers, Mike}}\n[[Category:1985 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Pompano Beach, Florida]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Florida]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Brewers players]]\n[[Category:Houston Astros players]]\n[[Category:Detroit Tigers players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Athletics players]]\n[[Category:Nova Southeastern Sharks baseball players]]\n[[Category:Helena Brewers players]]\n[[Category:Wisconsin Timber Rattlers players]]\n[[Category:Brevard County Manatees players]]\n[[Category:Huntsville Stars players]]\n[[Category:Surprise Rafters players]]\n[[Category:Nashville Sounds players]]\n[[Category:Leones del Caracas players]]\n[[Category:Broward Seahawks baseball players]]\n[[Category:Cumberlands Patriots baseball players]]\n[[Category:Deerfield Beach High School alumni]]\n", "name_user": "47.219.86.30", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Fiers"}

In addition, Seligman was also a member of [[Bruce Woolley]] & The Camera Club and [[The Dolphin Brothers]], and backed [[David Bowie]] at his performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.\n\n==Biography==\nSeligman was born in Cyprus, and his family moved to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[England]] eight months after his birth. Influenced by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Free (band)|Free]]\u2019s [[Andy Fraser]], and [[Tina Weymouth]] of [[Talking Heads]], he learned bass and subsequently, in his work with [[Thomas Dolby]], Moog. After a short spell with [[Bruce Woolley|Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club]], recording English Garden for CBS Records in 1979, he joined the [[Soft Boys]] for their 1980 album ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]'' (1980) with whom he subsequently recorded ''Invisible Hits'' (1981), ''Nextdoorland'' (2002) and ''Side 3'' (2002).\n\nIn addition to [[The Soft Boys]], Seligman was also in the early 80's a member of Local Heroes SW9 (playing on their first album, ''Drip Dry Zone'' (1980), with [[Kevin Armstrong (guitarist)|Kevin Armstrong]]), [[Bruce Woolley|The Camera Club]], the [[Thompson Twins]] and [[The Fallout Club]].

Production credits include a single with Brighton [[jangle pop]] outfit [[The Popguns]] (\"Crazy\", 1991) and ''[[Gravy Deco]]'' for [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\nIn 2002, Seligman played at the Shanghai Festival with Snail, along with Chris Bell and [[Jon Klein (musician)|Jonathan Klein]], and in 2007 began working with the Fire Escapes. In 2011\u201312 he contributed to Thomas Dolby's ''[[A Map of the Floating City]]'' also appearing with him on tours of the UK and northern Europe, at the Blue Note in Tokyo in February 2012 and at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, the UK in July 2012. In 2014, with fellow Fire Escapers Mark Headley and Lucy Pullin, he completed the Magical Creatures' ''Wishing Machine'' collection, also appearing live with them at a summer 2016 William Burroughs-inspired launch party in Brighton, UK.\n\nMatthew has always played a black Fender Jazz bass as his first choice instrument.
