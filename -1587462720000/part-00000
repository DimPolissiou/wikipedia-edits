Tokai is part of the Cape Peninsula centre of endemism of the [[Cape Floristic Region]].  With over 9000 species of plants the Cape Flora is by far the richest temperate flora on earth, earning itself the status of one of the 6 Floral Kingdoms on earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Floral Kingdoms |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1007|website=UNESCO|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Thus this tiny area has half of all the plant species in South Africa, and 20% of the flora of Africa. <ref name = \"CTBotanist\">{{cite web|title=Cape Town Botanist|url=http://www.capetownbotanist.com/pine-trees-protests-cape-flats-sand-fynbos/|website=Notes of a Cape Town Botanist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref><ref name = \"EndemicFactSheet\">{{cite web|title=Endemic Species Fact Sheet |url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_07_EndemicSpecies_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith over 2500 indigenous plant species the Peninsula is exceptionally rich even by Cape Floral standards.  By comparison, the United Kingdom has 1200 species of plants, the Kruger National Park has about 1980 species and Namibia has 3960 species. Additionally there are very few cities on earth with 150 plant species threatened with extinction, let alone in a single vegetation type within their borders ([[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]). Despite its remarkable species richness in a small area, Tokai Park is adjacent to a large conservation area, the World Heritage Site Table Mountain National Park [https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/ (SANParks)], and thus is not an isolated fragment and avoids associated management problems. <ref>{{cite web|author=SANParks Report |url=https://www.sanparks.org/assets/docs/parks_table_mountain/planning_docs/final-plan-1-25.pdf |title=Tokai Manor Precinct Plan|date=2012 |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> <ref name = \"CTBotanist\"/> In other words, the area is large enough to maintain minimum viable populations of plant species, making it ecologically viable. <ref name = \"PositionStatement\">{{cite web |url= https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/?id=56866|title= Position Statement: Tokai and Cecilia Plantations |date= 2016|website= www.sanparks.org |access-date=2019-05-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Geology of Tokai Park ==\nThree main geological types occur within Tokai Park.  The steeper slopes and cliffs of Constantiaberg are Peninsula Formation Sandstone of the Cape Supergroup, covered with plant communities belonging to Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.  The midslopes comprise  deep, fertile, loamy soils, derived from the older Cape Suite granites, which support Peninsula Granite Fynbos plant communities, but which have been converted elsewhere on the Peninsula to vineyards and leaf urban suburbs.  These granites also underlie the lower Tokai park, but these are covered by Tertiary sands.  These nutrient-poor, acidic sands reach thicknesses of tens of meters, and support the highly threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos.  The upper edge of the sands expose silcrete/ferricrete deposits, which have been mined in the past.  <ref name = \"SmallMammalStudy\"/>\n\n== Vegetation of Tokai Park ==\n\nTokai Park has four national vegetation types present, including: [[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] and some small patches of [[Afromontane]] Forest. Tokai Park is also the location of historical and cultural heritage, such as the [[Tokai Arboretum]]. <ref name = \"BertaThesis\"/>\n\n[[File:Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Cape Town endangered vegetation.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]\n\n===Cape Flats Sand Fynbos===\n[[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]] is the most threatened vegetation type at Tokai.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://studylib.net/doc/10392640/6.-cape-flats-sand-fynbos--cape-town%E2%80%99s-unique-biodiversit|website=Study Lib|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>  Only 11% of this veld type is left.  Less than 1% is conserved at present, making Tokai the most important nature reserve for this veld type.  The veld type currently contains 108 IUCN Red List species (92 threatened with extinction, 4 already extinct, and 12 other species of conservation concern).  It thus qualifies nationally as [[Critically Endangered]], both on account of its destruction and its high numbers of threatened species.  The sudden change in status of Tokai is not due to anything at Tokai itself, it is due to the rapid loss of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos elsewhere in Cape Town.  Projections of urban growth predict that unless something is urgently done, all remaining veld will be lost by 2020, leaving Tokai as the biggest reserve of this veld type. The City of Cape Town has targeted the Blouberg area as a priority conservation area to try and save a representative portion of this veld type.  This is a dry region (rainfall 410&nbsp;mm per year) - Tokai represents the wettest examples of this veld type, with almost double (190%) the average rainfall for this veld type. There are 2 IUCN Red Data List frog species on site.<ref>{{cite web|title=IUCN|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/54723/0|website=IUCN Redlist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Peninsula Granite Fynbos - Chapmans Peak Cape Town.JPG|thumb|right|Peninsula Granite Fynbos on Chapmans Peak]]\n\n===Peninsula Granite Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], occurs at the base of the mountain.  It forms the roots and foundation for the sandstone, and benefits from the moisture caught by the sandstone ramparts.  It is a relatively fertile soil, and consequently the vineyards and most expensive real estate in the city occurs on what used to be Granite Fynbos.  Because of its high carrying capacity, this is where the large herds of game, predators, and baboons used to occur historically in the southern Peninsula.  Silver Tree groves, lush riverine corridors and fertile, well-watered soils are in especial short supply along the west coast, and Constantia was one of the first farms developed by Europeans.  About one-third remains, and much that does is poorly managed, because of safety and fire concerns.  Some 24 IUCN Red List species occur, and 9 species are endemic or near-endemic to the type.  It is now classified as Critically Endangered, with 43% remaining; and only 30% conserved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Granite Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_02_PenGraniteFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rebelo |display-authors=etal |first1=AG|title=The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland|date=2006|publisher=Strelitzia 19, South African Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria|isbn=978-1919976-21-1}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos - Cape Peninsula - South Africa2.jpg|thumb|right|Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]]\n\n===Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] occurs on the uppermost slopes of Constantiaberg and Vlakkenberg.  It is confined to the sandstone geology, which weathers to a coarse sand.  The soil is exceptionally poor in nutrients and the carrying capacity for supporting animals is very low.  Animals do occur, but at extremely low densities.  The most common vertebrates are sunbirds and sugarbirds, subsidized by nectar provided by plants.  But in terms of plants this veld type is extremely rich: based solely on the large number (64) of threatened species, this veld type is classified as Endangered. Some 140 species of plant are categorized as [[Endemism|endemic]] to this vegetation type \u2013 they occur nowhere else on earth.  This high richness can be explained by the topography (greater relief means more habitats), the proximity to the sea (which limits the variation in climate, so that species occur in narrower zones on the mountain, thus packing more communities and species into the same altitudinal range), and the long isolation of the Peninsula mountains from the other mountains (so that fewer species are shared with neighbouring mountains at Kogelberg, Hottentots Holland and Piketberg, resulting in more unique species).<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_03_PenSandFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref> This vegetation type is well conserved: 97% remains; with 90% conserved.\n\n[[File:Afrotemperate forest western cape south africa.JPG|thumb|right|Afrotemperate forest]]\n\n===Afrotemperate Forest===\nThe [[Afrotemperate]] Forest is by far the rarest vegetation type at Tokai, and belongs to the Forest Biome.  Afrotemperate Forest cannot cope with fire, consequently it is confined to a few fire-safe kloofs at Tokai, minute pockets compared to the larger expanses in Orangekloof and Kirstenbosch.  As forests go, Afrotemperate is the richest forest in temperate regions, however, its species richness pales into insignificance compared to Fynbos: barely 20 species of tree occur naturally in these forests.  Animals, mainly insects, abound in these forests and their species diversity is extraordinary given their area.

Additionally there are very few cities on earth with 150 plant species threatened with extinction, let alone in a single vegetation type within their borders ([[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]). Despite its remarkable species richness in a small area, Tokai Park is adjacent to a large conservation area, the World Heritage Site Table Mountain National Park [https://www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/ (SANParks)], and thus is not an isolated fragment and avoids associated management problems. <ref>{{cite web|author=SANParks Report |url=https://www.sanparks.org/assets/docs/parks_table_mountain/planning_docs/final-plan-1-25.pdf |title=Tokai Manor Precinct Plan|date=2012 |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> <ref name = \"CTBotanist\"/> In other words, the area is large enough to maintain minimum viable populations of plant species, making it ecologically viable. <ref name = \"PositionStatement\">{{cite web |url= https://www.sanparks.org/about/news/?id=56866|title= Position Statement: Tokai and Cecilia Plantations |date= 2016|website= www.sanparks.org |access-date=2019-05-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Geology of Tokai Park ==\nThree main geological types occur within Tokai Park.  The steeper slopes and cliffs of Constantiaberg are Peninsula Formation Sandstone of the Cape Supergroup, covered with plant communities belonging to Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.  The midslopes comprise  deep, fertile, loamy soils, derived from the older Cape Suite granites, which support Peninsula Granite Fynbos plant communities, but which have been converted elsewhere on the Peninsula to vineyards and leaf urban suburbs.  These granites also underlie the lower Tokai park, but these are covered by Tertiary sands.  These nutrient-poor, acidic sands reach thicknesses of tens of meters, and support the highly threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos.  The upper edge of the sands expose silcrete/ferricrete deposits, which have been mined in the past.  <ref name = \"SmallMammalStudy\"/>\n\n== Vegetation of Tokai Park ==\n\nTokai Park has four national vegetation types present, including: [[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] and some small patches of [[Afromontane]] Forest. Tokai Park is also the location of historical and cultural heritage, such as the [[Tokai Arboretum]]. <ref name = \"BertaThesis\"/>\n\n[[File:Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Cape Town endangered vegetation.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]]\n\n===Cape Flats Sand Fynbos===\n[[Cape Flats Sand Fynbos]] is the most threatened vegetation type at Tokai.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cape Flats Sand Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://studylib.net/doc/10392640/6.-cape-flats-sand-fynbos--cape-town%E2%80%99s-unique-biodiversit|website=Study Lib|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>  Only 11% of this veld type is left.  Less than 1% is conserved at present, making Tokai the most important nature reserve for this veld type.  The veld type currently contains 108 IUCN Red List species (92 threatened with extinction, 4 already extinct, and 12 other species of conservation concern).  It thus qualifies nationally as [[Critically Endangered]], both on account of its destruction and its high numbers of threatened species.  The sudden change in status of Tokai is not due to anything at Tokai itself, it is due to the rapid loss of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos elsewhere in Cape Town.  Projections of urban growth predict that unless something is urgently done, all remaining veld will be lost by 2020, leaving Tokai as the biggest reserve of this veld type. The City of Cape Town has targeted the Blouberg area as a priority conservation area to try and save a representative portion of this veld type.  This is a dry region (rainfall 410&nbsp;mm per year) - Tokai represents the wettest examples of this veld type, with almost double (190%) the average rainfall for this veld type. There are 2 IUCN Red Data List frog species on site.<ref>{{cite web|title=IUCN|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/54723/0|website=IUCN Redlist|accessdate=18 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Peninsula Granite Fynbos - Chapmans Peak Cape Town.JPG|thumb|right|Peninsula Granite Fynbos on Chapmans Peak]]\n\n===Peninsula Granite Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], occurs at the base of the mountain.  It forms the roots and foundation for the sandstone, and benefits from the moisture caught by the sandstone ramparts.  It is a relatively fertile soil, and consequently the vineyards and most expensive real estate in the city occurs on what used to be Granite Fynbos.  Because of its high carrying capacity, this is where the large herds of game, predators, and baboons used to occur historically in the southern Peninsula.  Silver Tree groves, lush riverine corridors and fertile, well-watered soils are in especial short supply along the west coast, and Constantia was one of the first farms developed by Europeans.  About one-third remains, and much that does is poorly managed, because of safety and fire concerns.  Some 24 IUCN Red List species occur, and 9 species are endemic or near-endemic to the type.  It is now classified as Critically Endangered, with 43% remaining; and only 30% conserved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Granite Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_02_PenGraniteFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rebelo |display-authors=etal |first1=AG|title=The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland|date=2006|publisher=Strelitzia 19, South African Biodiversity Institute, Pretoria|isbn=978-1919976-21-1}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos - Cape Peninsula - South Africa2.jpg|thumb|right|Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]]\n\n===Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos===\n[[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] occurs on the uppermost slopes of Constantiaberg and Vlakkenberg.  It is confined to the sandstone geology, which weathers to a coarse sand.  The soil is exceptionally poor in nutrients and the carrying capacity for supporting animals is very low.  Animals do occur, but at extremely low densities.  The most common vertebrates are sunbirds and sugarbirds, subsidized by nectar provided by plants.  But in terms of plants this veld type is extremely rich: based solely on the large number (64) of threatened species, this veld type is classified as Endangered. Some 140 species of plant are categorized as [[Endemism|endemic]] to this vegetation type \u2013 they occur nowhere else on earth.  This high richness can be explained by the topography (greater relief means more habitats), the proximity to the sea (which limits the variation in climate, so that species occur in narrower zones on the mountain, thus packing more communities and species into the same altitudinal range), and the long isolation of the Peninsula mountains from the other mountains (so that fewer species are shared with neighbouring mountains at Kogelberg, Hottentots Holland and Piketberg, resulting in more unique species).<ref>{{cite web|title=Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos Fact Sheet|url=http://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Graphics%20and%20educational%20material/Biodiv_fact_sheet_03_PenSandFyn_2011-03.pdf|website=City of Cape Town|accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref> This vegetation type is well conserved: 97% remains; with 90% conserved.\n\n[[File:Afrotemperate forest western cape south africa.JPG|thumb|right|Afrotemperate forest]]\n\n===Afrotemperate Forest===\nThe [[Afrotemperate]] Forest is by far the rarest vegetation type at Tokai, and belongs to the Forest Biome.  Afrotemperate Forest cannot cope with fire, consequently it is confined to a few fire-safe kloofs at Tokai, minute pockets compared to the larger expanses in Orangekloof and Kirstenbosch.  As forests go, Afrotemperate is the richest forest in temperate regions, however, its species richness pales into insignificance compared to Fynbos: barely 20 species of tree occur naturally in these forests.  Animals, mainly insects, abound in these forests and their species diversity is extraordinary given their area.
