It is the sixth-oldest Catholic and fourth-oldest Jesuit university in the United States.<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\" /> Xavier has an undergraduate enrollment of 4,485 students and graduate enrollment of 2,165. It is primarily an [[undergraduate]], [[liberal arts]] institution.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Historical Collections of Ohio- An Encyclopedia of the State; History Both General and Local, Geography with Descriptions of Its Counties, Cities and Villages, Its Agricultural, Manufacturing, Mining (14772984405).jpg|thumb|left|St. Xavier Church, bishop's residence, and St. Xavier College in 1848]]\nXavier University is the fourth oldest Jesuit University and the sixth oldest Catholic university in the United States. The school was founded in 1831 as a men's college in downtown [[Cincinnati]] next to [[St. Francis Xavier Church (Cincinnati, Ohio)|St. Francis Xavier Church]] on Sycamore Street. The Athenaeum, as it was then called, was dedicated to the patronage of Saint [[Francis Xavier]] by Bishop [[Edward Fenwick]] on October 17, 1831. Upon Bishop [[John Baptist Purcell]]'s request, the [[Society of Jesus]] took control of The Athenaeum in 1840, and the name was changed to St. Xavier College in honor of the 16th century Jesuit missionary, St. [[Francis Xavier]] who, like the founder of the Jesuits, [[Ignatius Loyola]], was a Spanish [[Basques|Basque]]. \n\nSt. Xavier College moved in 1912 to its current Norwood location, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of downtown Cincinnati, after the purchase of {{convert|26|acres|km2}} from the Avondale Athletic Club. The [[Athenaeum of Ohio|\"original\" Anthenaeum]] is now the seminary of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archdiocese of Cincinnati]]. St. Xavier College and [[St. Xavier High School (Cincinnati)|St. Xavier High School]] officially split in 1919, though they did not become financially independent until 1934. The school's name was changed a second time to its current name, Xavier University, in 1930.\n\nThe Williams College of Business was established in 1961 and Xavier's first doctoral program, in psychology, began in 1997. Xavier fully admitted women in 1969, but women began attending the college in 1914 in the evening, weekend, and summer school divisions. [[Edgecliff College]], another Catholic college in Cincinnati, merged with Xavier University in 1980.\n\nIn 2000, Xavier opened the doors to the [[Cintas Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/09/07/loc_cintas_center_rising.html |title=Cintas Center rising on Xavier U.'s campus |publisher=Enquirer.com |date=September 7, 1999 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref> an arena for the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]]. Xavier also opened the [[Gallagher Student Center]] in 2002.\n\nSmith Hall and the Conaton Learning Commons opened in 2010 as part of the James E. Hoff, S.J., Academic Quadrangle. Fr. Hoff was the University's 33rd President, 1991\u20132000. [[Fr. Michael J. Graham, S.J.]], Hoff's successor and 34th President, still serves Xavier. Fenwick Place, a residential complex, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:XavierUniversityGallagherStudentCenter.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Gallagher Student Center.]]\nThe campus covers approximately {{convert|190|acre|km2}}<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\"/> in the City of [[Cincinnati]] (Norwood neighborhood) and features residential and academic malls, flanked by the older west campus and by the expanding east campus. At the center of campus are the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel. Bellarmine Chapel's roof is in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid, also known as a [[saddle roof]], that will not collapse even if the Chapel walls were removed. The chapel is also home to an active parish community independent of the university.\n\n===Academic mall===\nSix buildings with [[castle architecture]] sit elevated overlooking Victory Parkway to the west and resemble a single fortress. Next to the Gallagher Student Center (north to south) is Science Row: Lindner Hall (Physics), Logan Hall (Chemistry), and Albers Hall (Biology). In the middle of this impressive chain is Hinkle Hall, the three-story Tudor-Gothic structure that is the oldest standing building on campus (1919) and whose [[turret]]s were modeled after the Xavier Family Castle in [[Navarre]], [[Spain]]. It houses the Departments of Mathematics, Computer Science, English, History, Philosophy, and Theology. Schmidt Hall sits next as the University's current Administration Building. It is followed by Edgecliff Hall which was Alumni Science Hall (1919) but was renamed after the former [[Edgecliff College]] and is home to the Department of Music.\n\nOn the opposite side of the mall to the east stands the tallest structure on campus, Schott Hall. It houses the Office of Admission and Office of Financial Aid as well as the Departments of Modern Languages, Classics, Communication Arts, Political Science, and Sociology. Next (south to north) is McDonald Library followed by Alter Hall, which has been completely rebuilt.  Alter Hall is the main classroom building on campus, and was reopened for the 2015 fall semester. Finally, Hailstones Hall, which was the former home of the Williams College of Business, is adjoined behind Alter to the east, and so is not truly on the mall. Alter and Hailstones are next to Bellarmine Chapel.\n\n===Residential Mall===\nTo the north of the Academic Mall and on the opposite side of the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel is the Residential Mall. All four underclassmen residence halls are here. Brockman Hall is due north of Gallagher and is an all-freshmen, community-style residence where about 300 students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with their wing. Diagonally north across the mall is Buenger Hall. Buenger accommodates over 200 freshmen and sophomore athletes and honors students in suites. Diagonally south across the mall from Brockman and due east of Gallagher are Kuhlman Hall and Husman Hall. Kuhlman and Husman together house about 1,000 freshmen and sophomore students and feature suite style, where students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with another room. Between Kuhlman, Husman, and Gallagher is what is often referred to as \"The Xavier Yard,\" a large open all-purpose area for students and events.\n\n===Across Victory===\nOn the opposite side of Victory Parkway from the Academic and Residential malls is west campus. It is home to most of the athletics and recreational sports with facilities including [[J. Page Hayden Field]], Corcoran Soccer Field, Schmidt Fieldhouse, Corbett Physical Education Building, and the O'Connor Sports Center. St. Barbara Hall and the Armory are home to Xavier's ROTC. Joseph Hall and Elet Hall are home to the School of Education and Department of Psychology.\n\n===Cintas Center and Cohen Center===\nThe [[Cintas Center]], where the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]] host their [[basketball]] games, is adjacent to the Residential Mall.  Besides the 10,250-seat arena, Cintas also includes the Schiff Conference Center and the James and Caroline Duff Banquet Center.  Cintas is surrounded on all sides by several parking lots, and on the far east side is the A. B. Cohen Center.  Cohen is home to the Art Department and Xavier Art Gallery, as well as the School of Nursing and departments of Criminal Justice, Social Work, [[Occupational Therapy]], Health Services Administration, and some of the offices of the School of Education.\n\n=== Campus growth ===\nAs part of the latest construction on campus, a new residential complex called Fenwick Place opened in fall 2011 to the west of The Commons and south of the Residential Mall. It features four residential towers with 535 beds in a suite-style setup, similar to Buenger Hall, for sophomores and juniors. It is the home to a new dining center for all of campus. Fenwick Place opened for the 2011\u20132012 academic year. \n\nThe Hoff Academic Quadrangle, to the south of Fenwick Place and east of the Academic Mall, opened in 2010. Smith Hall is home to the Williams College of Business and features a [[Wall Street]]-style trading center with [[Bloomberg Terminal]]s and two stock tickers. Smith is also home to Xavier's MBA programs and Xavier's Entrepreneurial Center. The D'Artagnan Capital Fund (Xavier's undergraduate student investment fund) is in the building's Fifth Third Trading Center. Xavier's Entrepreneurship is ranked 11th nationally according to The Princeton Review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/topcolleges/undergrad/0.html |title=2015 top 25 colleges in entrepreneurship for undergraduates |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=September 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref> The Conaton Learning Commons is west of Smith Hall and next to the Academic Mall. The Learning Commons is home to all of Xavier's academic support services.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:XavierUniversitySmithHall.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith Hall, which houses the Williams College of Business]]\n\nXavier University offers 81 majors within the colleges of ''Arts and Sciences'', ''Social Sciences, Health and Education'', and the ''Williams College of Business''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Admission Office |publisher=Xavier University |url=http://www.xavier.edu/undergraduate-admission/academics/index.cfm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205025911/http://www.xavier.edu/undergraduate-admission/academics/index.cfm |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref> Several minors and pre-professional programs are also offered including a blended [http://acceleratednursing.xavier.edu/accelerated-nursing-program/ Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing] degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acceleratednursing.xavier.edu/|title=Second-Degree Accelerated BSN Program {{!}} Xavier University|website=Xavier ABSN|language=en-US|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref> All students must complete the core curriculum.\n\nUndergraduate students attending Xavier must complete a significant number of [[distribution requirements]] that are more commonly known as the Core Curriculum. There are required courses in: [[Theology]], [[Philosophy]], [[Mathematics]], [[Fine Arts]], [[History]], [[Physical Science]], [[Literature]], Foreign Language, and the [[Social Sciences]]. The Core Curriculum is a confluence of [[Jesuit]] ideals known as the [[Ratio Studiorum]] and a [[Great Books]] program. All students upon completion of a bachelor's degree have read [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]], [[Discourse on Method]], and selections from the [[Bible]] among other original texts.\n\n===Major requirements===\nAll undergraduate students are required to complete the Core Curriculum (see above) and comply with departmental requirements. Business majors (from the Williams College of Business) are also required to complete the Business Core, which consists of courses in Accounting, Business Law, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, and Statistics (the Business Core occupies 35 credit hours). Business majors, therefore, are only required to take 18\u201321 hours in their chosen field (providing many students with an incentive to declare a second major within the Williams College of Business). Students in the other colleges (the College of Social Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences) generally have to complete at least 60 credit hours of courses within the major and electives within the College. To graduate with a B.A. or B.S. degree, 120 credit hours must be obtained, and all students must achieve a 2.0 GPA minimum in their major course of study. Most scholarships require a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Transfer scholarships are awarded based on GPA from previous university attended.\n\nCertain majors, such as Politics Philosophy and the Public (PPP), Honors Bachelor of Arts (HAB), and Philosophy, require a written thesis and defense before a selected committee. Philosophy also requires a written comprehensive exam.\n\n===Honorary society chapters===\nXavier has several honorary society chapters, including:\n* [[Alpha Sigma Nu]], the honor society of Jesuit institutions of higher education<ref>{{cite web|title=Alpha Sigma Nu|url=http://www.alphasigmanu.org/index.php/students/list-of-member-institutions/}}</ref>\n* [[Beta Alpha Psi]], an honor organization for financial information students and professionals<ref>{{cite web|title=Beta Alpha Psi|url=https://www.bap.org/active-chapters}}</ref>\n* [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], the international honor society serving business programs accredited by AACSB International<ref>{{cite web|title=Beta Gamma Sigma |url=http://www.betagammasigma.org/chapterhonoree.htm#x |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231150/http://betagammasigma.org/chapterhonoree.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}</ref>\n* [[Phi Beta Kappa]], an elite honor society present within only 10% of universities<ref>{{cite web|title=Phi Beta Kappa|url=http://www.pbk.org/home/chapterdirectory.aspx?z=X|access-date=May 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020022614/http://www.pbk.org/home/chapterdirectory.aspx?z=X|archive-date=October 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Mortar Board]], national honor society recognizing college seniors<ref>{{cite web|title=Mortar Board |url=http://www.mortarboard.org/chapter/map.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029225638/http://www.mortarboard.org/chapter/map.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}</ref>\n* [[Eta Sigma Phi]], an honor society aimed at preserving interest and scholarship in Classical Studies.\n\n===Rankings===\n* Xavier was ranked 8th among 172 Midwest colleges and universities by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' for its 2019 edition of ''America's Best Colleges'' report.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/search?schoolName=Xavier%20University</ref>\n* It was ranked 1st for average six-year graduation rate in the Midwest at 78%, 3rd for alumni giving and 2nd for \"up and coming schools.\"<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\"/>\n* [[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] listed Xavier 70th among 100 private college and universities as a \"Best Value\" for 2013.<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\"/>\n* [[Forbes]] ranked 272nd among ''America's Top Colleges'' for 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/|title=America's Top Colleges|website=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Xavier Musketeers}}\n[[File:Xavier Musketeers logo.svg|thumb|Musketeers logo|upright]]\nXavier competes at the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level in the [[Big East Conference]], and their mascot is [[D'Artagnan]] the [[Musketeer]].

Renamed the Midwestern Collegiate Conference in 1985, it is now known as the Horizon League.

The school was founded in 1831 as a men's college in downtown [[Cincinnati]] next to [[St. Francis Xavier Church (Cincinnati, Ohio)|St. Francis Xavier Church]] on Sycamore Street. The Athenaeum, as it was then called, was dedicated to the patronage of Saint [[Francis Xavier]] by Bishop [[Edward Fenwick]] on October 17, 1831. Upon Bishop [[John Baptist Purcell]]'s request, the [[Society of Jesus]] took control of The Athenaeum in 1840, and the name was changed to St. Xavier College in honor of the 16th century Jesuit missionary, St. [[Francis Xavier]] who, like the founder of the Jesuits, [[Ignatius Loyola]], was a Spanish [[Basques|Basque]]. \n\nSt. Xavier College moved in 1912 to its current Norwood location, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of downtown Cincinnati, after the purchase of {{convert|26|acres|km2}} from the Avondale Athletic Club. The [[Athenaeum of Ohio|\"original\" Anthenaeum]] is now the seminary of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archdiocese of Cincinnati]]. St. Xavier College and [[St. Xavier High School (Cincinnati)|St. Xavier High School]] officially split in 1919, though they did not become financially independent until 1934. The school's name was changed a second time to its current name, Xavier University, in 1930.\n\nThe Williams College of Business was established in 1961 and Xavier's first doctoral program, in psychology, began in 1997. Xavier fully admitted women in 1969, but women began attending the college in 1914 in the evening, weekend, and summer school divisions. [[Edgecliff College]], another Catholic college in Cincinnati, merged with Xavier University in 1980.\n\nIn 2000, Xavier opened the doors to the [[Cintas Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/09/07/loc_cintas_center_rising.html |title=Cintas Center rising on Xavier U.'s campus |publisher=Enquirer.com |date=September 7, 1999 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref> an arena for the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]].

Fenwick Place, a residential complex, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:XavierUniversityGallagherStudentCenter.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Gallagher Student Center.]]\nThe campus covers approximately {{convert|190|acre|km2}}<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\"/> in the City of [[Cincinnati]] (Norwood neighborhood) and features residential and academic malls, flanked by the older west campus and by the expanding east campus. At the center of campus are the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel. Bellarmine Chapel's roof is in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid, also known as a [[saddle roof]], that will not collapse even if the Chapel walls were removed. The chapel is also home to an active parish community independent of the university.\n\n===Academic mall===\nSix buildings with [[castle architecture]] sit elevated overlooking Victory Parkway to the west and resemble a single fortress. Next to the Gallagher Student Center (north to south) is Science Row: Lindner Hall (Physics), Logan Hall (Chemistry), and Albers Hall (Biology). In the middle of this impressive chain is Hinkle Hall, the three-story Tudor-Gothic structure that is the oldest standing building on campus (1919) and whose [[turret]]s were modeled after the Xavier Family Castle in [[Navarre]], [[Spain]]. It houses the Departments of Mathematics, Computer Science, English, History, Philosophy, and Theology. Schmidt Hall sits next as the University\u2019s current Administration Building. It is followed by Edgecliff Hall which was Alumni Science Hall (1919) but was renamed after the former [[Edgecliff College]] and is home to the Department of Music.\n\nOn the opposite side of the mall to the east stands the tallest structure on campus, Schott Hall. It houses the Office of Admission and Office of Financial Aid as well as the Departments of Modern Languages, Classics, Communication Arts, Political Science, and Sociology. Next (south to north) is McDonald Library followed by Alter Hall, which has been completely rebuilt.  Alter Hall is the main classroom building on campus, and was reopened for the 2015 fall semester. Finally, Hailstones Hall, which was the former home of the Williams College of Business, is adjoined behind Alter to the east, and so is not truly on the mall. Alter and Hailstones are next to Bellarmine Chapel.\n\n===Residential Mall===\nTo the north of the Academic Mall and on the opposite side of the Gallagher Student Center and Bellarmine Chapel is the Residential Mall. All four underclassmen residence halls are here. Brockman Hall is due north of Gallagher and is an all-freshmen, community-style residence where about 300 students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with their wing. Diagonally north across the mall is Buenger Hall. Buenger accommodates over 200 freshmen and sophomore athletes and honors students in suites. Diagonally south across the mall from Brockman and due east of Gallagher are Kuhlman Hall and Husman Hall. Kuhlman and Husman together house about 1,000 freshmen and sophomore students and feature suite style, where students have one or two roommates and share a bathroom with another room. Between Kuhlman, Husman, and Gallagher is what is often referred to as \"The Xavier Yard,\" a large open all-purpose area for students and events.\n\n===Across Victory===\nOn the opposite side of Victory Parkway from the Academic and Residential malls is west campus. It is home to most of the athletics and recreational sports with facilities including [[J. Page Hayden Field]], Corcoran Soccer Field, Schmidt Fieldhouse, Corbett Physical Education Building, and the O'Connor Sports Center. St. Barbara Hall and the Armory are home to Xavier's ROTC. Joseph Hall and Elet Hall are home to the School of Education and Department of Psychology.\n\n===Cintas Center and Cohen Center===\nThe [[Cintas Center]], where the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]] host their [[basketball]] games, is adjacent to the Residential Mall.  Besides the 10,250-seat arena, Cintas also includes the Schiff Conference Center and the James and Caroline Duff Banquet Center.  Cintas is surrounded on all sides by several parking lots, and on the far east side is the A. B. Cohen Center.  Cohen is home to the Art Department and Xavier Art Gallery, as well as the School of Nursing and departments of Criminal Justice, Social Work, [[Occupational Therapy]], Health Services Administration, and some of the offices of the School of Education.\n\n=== Campus growth ===\nAs part of the latest construction on campus, a new residential complex called Fenwick Place opened in fall 2011 to the west of The Commons and south of the Residential Mall. It features four residential towers with 535 beds in a suite-style setup, similar to Buenger Hall, for sophomores and juniors. It is the home to a new dining center for all of campus. Fenwick Place opened for the 2011\u20132012 academic year. \n\nThe Hoff Academic Quadrangle, to the south of Fenwick Place and east of the Academic Mall, opened in 2010. Smith Hall is home to the Williams College of Business and features a [[Wall Street]]-style trading center with [[Bloomberg Terminal]]s and two stock tickers. Smith is also home to Xavier's MBA programs and Xavier's Entrepreneurial Center. The D'Artagnan Capital Fund (Xavier's undergraduate student investment fund) is in the building's Fifth Third Trading Center. Xavier's Entrepreneurship is ranked 11th nationally according to The Princeton Review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/topcolleges/undergrad/0.html |title=2015 top 25 colleges in entrepreneurship for undergraduates |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=September 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref> The Conaton Learning Commons is west of Smith Hall and next to the Academic Mall.

There are required courses in: [[Theology]], [[Philosophy]], [[Mathematics]], [[Fine Arts]], [[History]], [[Physical Science]], [[Literature]], Foreign Language, and the [[Social Sciences]]. The Core Curriculum is a confluence of [[Jesuit]] ideals known as the [[Ratio Studiorum]] and a [[Great Books]] program. All students upon completion of a bachelor's degree have read [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]], [[Discourse on Method]], and selections from the [[Bible]] among other original texts.\n\n===Major requirements===\nAll undergraduate students are required to complete the Core Curriculum (see above) and comply with departmental requirements. Business majors (from the Williams College of Business) are also required to complete the Business Core, which consists of courses in Accounting, Business Law, Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, and Statistics (the Business Core occupies 35 credit hours). Business majors, therefore, are only required to take 18\u201321 hours in their chosen field (providing many students with an incentive to declare a second major within the Williams College of Business). Students in the other colleges (the College of Social Sciences and the College of Arts and Sciences) generally have to complete at least 60 credit hours of courses within the major and electives within the College. To graduate with a B.A. or B.S. degree, 120 credit hours must be obtained, and all students must achieve a 2.0 GPA minimum in their major course of study. Most scholarships require a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Transfer scholarships are awarded based on GPA from previous university attended.\n\nCertain majors, such as Politics Philosophy and the Public (PPP), Honors Bachelor of Arts (HAB), and Philosophy, require a written thesis and defense before a selected committee. Philosophy also requires a written comprehensive exam.\n\n===Honorary society chapters===\nXavier has several honorary society chapters, including:\n* [[Alpha Sigma Nu]], the honor society of Jesuit institutions of higher education<ref>{{cite web|title=Alpha Sigma Nu|url=http://www.alphasigmanu.org/index.php/students/list-of-member-institutions/}}</ref>\n* [[Beta Alpha Psi]], an honor organization for financial information students and professionals<ref>{{cite web|title=Beta Alpha Psi|url=https://www.bap.org/active-chapters}}</ref>\n* [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], the international honor society serving business programs accredited by AACSB International<ref>{{cite web|title=Beta Gamma Sigma |url=http://www.betagammasigma.org/chapterhonoree.htm#x |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510231150/http://betagammasigma.org/chapterhonoree.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2013 }}</ref>\n* [[Phi Beta Kappa]], an elite honor society present within only 10% of universities<ref>{{cite web|title=Phi Beta Kappa|url=http://www.pbk.org/home/chapterdirectory.aspx?z=X|access-date=May 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020022614/http://www.pbk.org/home/chapterdirectory.aspx?z=X|archive-date=October 20, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Mortar Board]], national honor society recognizing college seniors<ref>{{cite web|title=Mortar Board |url=http://www.mortarboard.org/chapter/map.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029225638/http://www.mortarboard.org/chapter/map.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}</ref>\n* [[Eta Sigma Phi]], an honor society aimed at preserving interest and scholarship in Classical Studies.\n\n===Rankings===\n* Xavier was ranked 8th among 172 Midwest colleges and universities by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' for its 2019 edition of ''America's Best Colleges'' report.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/search?schoolName=Xavier%20University</ref>\n* It was ranked 1st for average six-year graduation rate in the Midwest at 78%, 3rd for alumni giving and 2nd for \"up and coming schools.\"<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\"/>\n* [[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]] listed Xavier 70th among 100 private college and universities as a \"Best Value\" for 2013.<ref name=\"XU_FACTS_JAN2013\"/>\n* [[Forbes]] ranked 272nd among ''America's Top Colleges'' for 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/|title=America's Top Colleges|website=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|Xavier Musketeers}}\n[[File:Xavier Musketeers logo.svg|thumb|Musketeers logo|upright]]\nXavier competes at the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level in the [[Big East Conference]], and their mascot is [[D'Artagnan]] the [[Musketeer]].
