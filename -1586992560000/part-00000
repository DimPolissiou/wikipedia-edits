The resultant route 138 continues west into Newport as Admiral Kalbfus Way. Route&nbsp;114 heads north on West Main Road in Middletown and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]]. In Portsmouth the right lane becomes [[Route 24 (Rhode Island)|Route 24]] as the left lane curves maintaining Route&nbsp;114 in Portsmouth, Route&nbsp;114 turns onto Bristol Ferry Road then crosses [[Mount Hope Bay]] into the town of [[Bristol, Rhode Island|Bristol]] along the [[Mount Hope Bridge]]. In Bristol, it continues north along Ferry Road then shifts to Hope Street. The route then enters the town of [[Warren, Rhode Island|Warren]], along Main Street through the town center, where it meets and conjoins [[Route 103 (Rhode Island)|Route 103]]. The concurrent route crosses the [[Palmer River (Massachusetts \u2013 Rhode Island)|Palmer]] and [[Barrington River (Rhode Island)|Barrington]] rivers into the town of [[Barrington, Rhode Island|Barrington]]. Routes 114 and 103 continue together along County Road, with Route&nbsp;114 soon splitting to the north using the Wampanoag Trail. Route&nbsp;114 eventually reaches the city of [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]], where the road curves west to meet Route 103 again at Pawtucket Avenue. Along the way, the East Shore Expressway begins at the Wampanoag Trail to connect to [[I-195 (RI)|I-195]]. Pawtucket Avenue continues north through downtown East Providence, crossing over [[I-195 (RI)|I-195]], where it is joined by [[US 1A (RI)|US 1A]].\n\nRoutes 1A and 114 continue through the northern part of East Providence towards the city of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]], with US 1A later splitting off to the north as Route&nbsp;114 heads northwest into the city of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]]. In Pawtucket, Route&nbsp;114 splits into a [[one-way couplet]] with the northbound direction using Prospect Street and the southbound direction using School Street. After running through several Pawtucket city streets, including an interchange with [[I-95 (RI)|I-95]], Route&nbsp;114 crosses the [[Blackstone River]] and continues north along Broad Street into the city of [[Central Falls, Rhode Island|Central Falls]].{{#tag:ref|To follow Route&nbsp;114 northbound through Pawtucket, one must follow Prospect Street, continuing on School Street, then turning right onto Main Street, which merges into Wolcott Street.

Though the routing seems odd by conventional thinking, it is well-defined in the 2001 edition of the Pavement Log kept by the [[Rhode Island Department of Transportation]]. As of July 2005 the signage in the vicinity is very spotty and offers no evidence to dispute the pavement log and, in some cases, the little signage that does exist actually seems to support it. On the other hand, Pawtucket's Department of Public Works has Route&nbsp;114 northbound using Exchange Street, which is shorter and matches the southbound direction.

However, no sign was installed on Route&nbsp;114 southbound to turn left at Rathbun, and the old sign at Social (Route 126) has not been removed. Thus southbound traffic is still directed to turn left onto Social without a [[traffic signal]], and the new sign for southbound traffic pointing right onto Diamond Hill from Social is not seen by Route&nbsp;114 traffic.|group=lower-alpha|name=Woonsocket}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rhode Island Route&nbsp;114 near Portsmouth.JPG|right|thumb|RI 114 in Portsmouth]]\nTwo sections of modern Route&nbsp;114 were previously laid out as [[Toll road|turnpikes]] in the early 19th century. In 1805, a charter was granted to the Rhode Island Turnpike corporation, which constructed a road from Portsmouth center to the [[Bristol Ferry]] at the north end of [[Aquidneck Island]]. The road is now Bristol Ferry Road (Route&nbsp;114) and Turnpike Avenue. In 1813, the road from northern Pawtucket to the village of Valley Falls in Cumberland was also laid out as a turnpike, known as the Valley Falls Turnpike'. The old road is what is now Broad Street in Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Cumberland.\n\nRoute&nbsp;114 was an original Rhode Island route designated in 1923, running from Newport to Grants Mills in Cumberland. Until the 1960s, Route&nbsp;114 ended at the intersection of Pine Swamp Road and Diamond Hill Road in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]]. Present-day Route&nbsp;114 from that point west to [[Route 122 (Rhode Island)|Route 122]] in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] was given the [[Route 142 (Rhode Island)|Route 142]] and later the [[Route 11 (Rhode Island)|Route 11]] designation. When [[Route 11 (Rhode Island)|Route 11]] became [[Route 121 (Rhode Island)|Route 121]] in the 1960s, [[Route 121 (Rhode Island)|Route 121]]'s terminus was cut back to the same intersection where Route&nbsp;114 originally ended, and the route west to [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]] became Route&nbsp;114.\n\nIn 2000, part of Route&nbsp;114 northbound south of downtown [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] was re-routed. The old alignment left Prospect Street at Pond Street, went east along Pond Street to Summit Street, north on Summit Street (this turn onto Summit is still signed as of July 2005) and re-joined Route&nbsp;114 southbound at the corner of Summit Street and Division Street.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|state=RI|length_ref=<ref name=\"length\"/>|location_ref=<ref>{{cite map |url=

In Pawtucket, Route&nbsp;114 splits into a [[one-way couplet]] with the northbound direction using Prospect Street and the southbound direction using School Street. After running through several Pawtucket city streets, including an interchange with [[I-95 (RI)|I-95]], Route&nbsp;114 crosses the [[Blackstone River]] and continues north along Broad Street into the city of [[Central Falls, Rhode Island|Central Falls]].{{#tag:ref|To follow Route&nbsp;114 northbound through Pawtucket, one must follow Prospect Street, continuing on School Street, then turning right onto Main Street, which merges into Wolcott Street.

Though the routing seems odd by conventional thinking, it is well-defined in the 2001 edition of the Pavement Log kept by the [[Rhode Island Department of Transportation]]. As of July 2005 the signage in the vicinity is very spotty and offers no evidence to dispute the pavement log and, in some cases, the little signage that does exist actually seems to support it. On the other hand, Pawtucket's Department of Public Works has Route&nbsp;114 northbound using Exchange Street, which is shorter and matches the southbound direction.

However, no sign was installed on Route&nbsp;114 southbound to turn left at Rathbun, and the old sign at Social (Route 126) has not been removed. Thus southbound traffic is still directed to turn left onto Social without a [[traffic signal]], and the new sign for southbound traffic pointing right onto Diamond Hill from Social is not seen by Route&nbsp;114 traffic.|group=lower-alpha|name=Woonsocket}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rhode Island Route&nbsp;114 near Portsmouth.JPG|right|thumb|RI 114 in Portsmouth]]\nTwo sections of modern Route&nbsp;114 were previously laid out as [[Toll road|turnpikes]] in the early 19th century. In 1805, a charter was granted to the Rhode Island Turnpike corporation, which constructed a road from Portsmouth center to the [[Bristol Ferry]] at the north end of [[Aquidneck Island]]. The road is now Bristol Ferry Road (Route&nbsp;114) and Turnpike Avenue. In 1813, the road from northern Pawtucket to the village of Valley Falls in Cumberland was also laid out as a turnpike, known as the Valley Falls Turnpike'. The old road is what is now Broad Street in Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Cumberland.\n\nRoute&nbsp;114 was an original Rhode Island route designated in 1923, running from Newport to Grants Mills in Cumberland. Until the 1960s, Route&nbsp;114 ended at the intersection of Pine Swamp Road and Diamond Hill Road in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]]. Present-day Route&nbsp;114 from that point west to [[Route 122 (Rhode Island)|Route 122]] in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] was given the [[Route 142 (Rhode Island)|Route 142]] and later the [[Route 11 (Rhode Island)|Route 11]] designation. When [[Route 11 (Rhode Island)|Route 11]] became [[Route 121 (Rhode Island)|Route 121]] in the 1960s, [[Route 121 (Rhode Island)|Route 121]]'s terminus was cut back to the same intersection where Route&nbsp;114 originally ended, and the route west to [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island|Woonsocket]] became Route&nbsp;114.\n\nIn 2000, part of Route&nbsp;114 northbound south of downtown [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] was re-routed. The old alignment left Prospect Street at Pond Street, went east along Pond Street to Summit Street, north on Summit Street (this turn onto Summit is still signed as of July 2005) and re-joined Route&nbsp;114 southbound at the corner of Summit Street and Division Street.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|state=RI|length_ref=<ref name=\"length\"/>|location_ref=<ref>{{cite map |url= http://www.dot.ri.gov/documents/gis/maps/NC01.PDF |title= General Highway Map: Portsmouth/Middletown/Newport |publisher= [[Rhode Island Department of Transportation]] |format= PDF |accessdate= December 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |url= http://www.dot.ri.gov/documents/gis/maps/BC01.PDF|title=General Highway Map: Barrington/Warren/Bristol |accessdate= December 20, 2011 |format= PDF |publisher= Rhode Island Department of Transportation }}</ref><ref>{{cite map |url= http://www.dot.ri.gov/documents/gis/maps/PC08.PDF |title= General Highway Map: Providence/North Providence/Pawtucket/Central Falls/East Providence |format= PDF |publisher= Rhode Island Department of Transportation |accessdate= December 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |url= http://www.dot.ri.gov/documents/gis/maps/PC04.PDF |format= PDF |title= General Highway Map: Woonsocket/Lincoln/Cumberland |accessdate= December 20, 2011 |publisher= Rhode Island Department of Transportation }}</ref>}}\n{{RIint\n|county=Newport\n|cspan=4\n|location=Middletown\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.0\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|138|name1=Admiral Kalbfus Road|dir1=west}}\n|notes=Southern terminus;

Also it can contain optional metadata stored as [[XML]] file, but there's no open format or DTD schema for it. \n\nThe [[filename extension]] indicates the archive type used:\n* .cb7 \u2192 [[7z]]\n* .cba \u2192 [[ACE (compression file format)|ACE]]\n* .cbr \u2192 [[RAR (file format)|RAR]]<ref>{{cite web|title=CBR file extension|url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/cbr|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n* .cbt \u2192 [[tar (file format)|TAR]]\n* .cbz \u2192 [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]]<ref>{{cite web|title=CBZ file extension|url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/cbz|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nComic book archive files are not a distinct file format; only the file name extension differs from a standard file of the given archive type.\n\nComic book archive viewers typically offer various dedicated functions to read the content, like one page forward/backwards, go to first/last page, zoom or print. Some applications support additional tag information in the form of embedded XML files in the archive or use of the ZIP comment to store additional information.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://code.google.com/p/comicbookinfo/ | title = Metadata for Digital Comics }}</ref>{{Dead link|date=March 2020}} These files can include additional information like artists, story information, table of contents or even a separate text layer for comic book translations.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://launchpad.net/acbf | title = Advanced Comic Book Format project page }}</ref>\n\n== Adoption ==\n\n===Windows===\n* [[Calibre (software)|Calibre]] e-book reader can view and convert comic archives to different formats, but does not handle .cbr or .cb7 formats.\n* [[CDisplay]] was the first application to support the CBR format.\n* CDisplayEx inspired by [[CDisplay]] with additional viewing features.\n* [[Comic Seer (Desktop)]] is a comic book archive viewer and organizer for the desktop.\n* [[Gonvisor]] is a comic reader simple to use with some features to improve image quality.\n* [[STDU Viewer]]\n* [[SumatraPDF]]\n\n===Mac===\n* [[Calibre (software)|Calibre]] can view and convert to different formats.\n* [[Simple Comic]], an open source comic viewer with many features including archive reading support.\n\n===Android=== \n* [[FBReader]] supports CBZ/CBR files on Android via the ComicBook plugin available from its website<ref>{{cite web |title=FBReader ComicBook plugin|url=https://fbreader.org/content/fbreader-comicbook-plugin |website=FBReader}}</ref>.\n* Moon+ Reader supports CBZ and CBR files.\n* Readler can read CBZ/CBR files ad-free.\n\n===Unix-like===\n* [[Calibre (software)|Calibre]] can view and convert to different formats.\n* [[Comic Seer (Desktop)]] is a comic book archive viewer and organizer for the desktop.\n* [[Evince]] document viewer, includes support for the format.\n* [[Okular]] can view many formats, including PDF and CBR, and is included in the [[KDE Software Compilation]].\n* [[MuPDF]] is a cross-platform lightweight PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Comparison of image viewers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Software/Graphics/Viewers/Comic_Book_Files}}\n\n{{Ebooks}} <!--navbox-->\n\n[[Category:Computer file formats]]\n[[Category:E-books]]\n[[Category:Comics formats]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_archive"}
