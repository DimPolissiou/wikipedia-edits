This \"cultural decade\" is more loosely defined than the actual decade, beginning around [[1963]] with the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy assassination]] and ending around [[1974]] with the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name=\"Barth84Exhaustion\">[[John Barth]] (1984) intro to ''[[The Literature of Exhaustion]]'', in ''The Friday Book''.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/books/05masl.html| work= [[The New York Times]] | title= Brokaw Explores Another Turning Point, the '60s  | date= 5 November 2007 | accessdate= 26 August 2011 | author = [[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]}}</ref>\n\n\"The Sixties\", as they are known in both scholarship and popular culture, is a term used by historians, journalists, and other academics to describe the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and revolution in social norms about clothing, music, drugs, dress, sexuality, formalities, and schooling; and in others to denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess, flamboyance, and decay of social order. The decade was also labeled the [[Swinging London|Swinging Sixties]] because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time, but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music; from a folk music revival, to the Beatles revolution, to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Norms of all kinds were broken down, especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars.\n\nCommentator [[Christopher Booker]]<ref>[[Christopher Booker]]: ''The Neophiliacs:  A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties'', Gambit Incorporated, London, 1970</ref> described this era as a classical [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater [[Individualism|individual freedom]], broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several [[Western culture|Western]] nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] turned to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] in the early and mid-1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\n\nThe [[Cold War|confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union]] dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global [[superpower]] and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by [[proxy war]]s, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\n\nIn response to [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] campaigns from groups like the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-7,00.html|title=The Economy: We Are All Keynesians Now|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=1 January 2011|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|quote=Keynesianism made its biggest breakthrough under John Kennedy, who, as Arthur Schlesinger reports in A Thousand Days, \"was unquestionably the first Keynesian President.\"}}</ref> and staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], pushed for social reforms.  Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] including civil rights for [[African Americans]] and healthcare for [[Medicare (United States)|the elderly]] and [[Medicaid|the poor]]. Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] outraged student protestors around the globe.  The [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] upon working with underpaid [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|Tennessee garbage collectors]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]], and [[Chicago Seven|the police response towards protesters of the 1968 Democratic National Convention]], defined politics of violence in the United States.\n\nIn Western Europe and Japan, organizations such as [[Situationist International|those present at May 1968]], the [[Red Army Faction]], and the [[Zengakuren]] tested [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracy's]] ability to satisfy its marginalized or alienated citizenry amidst [[Advanced capitalism|post-industrial age hybrid capitalist economies]].

Unlike other European nations, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]] did not leave its African colonies, or the overseas provinces, during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements, most prominently led by [[communist]]-led parties who cooperated under the [[CONCP]] umbrella and pro-U.S. groups, became active in these areas, most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]].

Mao alleged that \"liberal bourgeois\" elements were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore [[capitalism]]. Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], [[West Bengal]], led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in August 1966 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was able to forge a connection. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 in France|May]] student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed capable of overthrowing the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. De Gaulle went off to visit French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.\n* University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.\n* In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West. In Poland and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] they protested against restrictions on free speech by [[communist]] regimes.\n* The [[Tlatelolco massacre]] \u2013 was a government massacre of student and civilian protesters and bystanders that took place during the afternoon and night of 2 October 1968, in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] section of Mexico City.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1960\u20131969}}\nProminent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade included:\n* On 27 May 1960, a coup in [[Turkey]] led by [[Cemal G\u00fcrsel]] and [[Cemal Madano\u011flu]] overthrew the government of [[Adnan Menderes]].\n* On 16 May 1961, a coup in [[South Korea]] led by army officer [[Park Chung-hee]] made the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* In 1963, a coup in [[South Viet Nam]] leads to the death of President [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] and the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* On 21 April 1967, in Greece a group of colonels established a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military dictatorship]] for seven years.\n* In 1968, a coup in Iraq led to the overthrow of [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] by the [[Arab socialism|Arab Socialist]] [[Baath Party]].\n* On 1 September 1969, a small group of military officers led by the army officer [[Muammar Gaddafi]] overthrows monarchy in [[Libya]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|150px|Pictures of Soviet missile silos in [[Cuba]], taken by United States spy planes on 1 November 1962.]]\n* The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) \u2013 a near-military confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union about the presence of Soviet missiles in [[Cuba]].

President Kennedy had plans to restore Sino-US relations, but his assassination, the war in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution put an end to that. Not until Richard Nixon took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n* Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S., as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]].

In his campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to \"get America moving again.\" His goal was economic growth of 4\u20136% per year and unemployment below 4%. To do this, he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment. By the end of the decade, median family income had risen from $8,540 in 1963 to $10,770 by 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. History \u2013 1960s|url=http://elcoushistory.tripod.com/economics1960.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the first half of the decade had low inflation, by 1966 Kennedy's tax credit had reduced unemployment to 3.7% and inflation remained below 2%.

Fires had erupted on the river many times, including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that \"oozes rather than flows\" and in which a person \"does not drown but decays.\" This helped spur legislative action on water pollution control resulting in the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Hurricane Camille]] hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status. To date it is the strongest hurricane ever recorded at landfall in means of sustained windspeed in the Atlantic Basin, reaching sustained winds of 190&nbsp;mph and a low pressure of 905 mbs. It is one of only three hurricanes in the Atlantic to ever make landfall at Category 5 Status and one of only four hurricanes worldwide to reach a maximum sustained windspeed of 190&nbsp;mph.\n\n'''Non-natural:'''\n* On 16 December 1960, a [[United Airlines]] DC-8 and a [[Trans World Airlines]] Lockheed Constellation [[1960 New York mid-air collision|collided over New York City]] and crashed, killing 134 people.\n* On 15 February 1961, [[Sabena Flight 548]] crashed on its way to Brussels, Belgium, killing all 72 passengers on board and 1 person on the ground. Among those killed were all 18 members of the US figure skating team, on their way to the World Championships. \n* On 16 March 1962, [[Flying Tiger Line Flight 739]], a Lockheed Super Constellation, inexplicably disappeared over the Western Pacific, leaving all 107 on board presumed dead.

This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\".  Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American|black American]]s and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolent action|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included [[boycott]]s such as the successful [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955\u20131956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the [[Southwestern United States]], such as [[California]] with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>[http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html History | LULAC-League of United Latin American Citizens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling which declared that segregating children of \"Mexican and Latin descent\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 ''[[Hernandez v.

The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in [[Miami, Florida]].\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.  A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.  These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality.  This philosophy would be dominant again after [[AIDS]], but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close.  Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.  Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.  On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.  This uprising called the [[Stonewall Riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf U.S. Census Bureau Data https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n\n===Science===\n\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968 the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September, 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, [[Apollo 11]], the [[Moon landing|first human spaceflight landed on the Moon]]. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and the Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.\n\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 - The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 - The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 \u2013 [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 \u2013 First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 \u2013 Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n\n===Technology===\n\n====Automobiles====\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 \u2013 [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 \u2013 [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 \u2013 First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 \u2013 The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 \u2013 Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 \u2013 The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], '''[[Syncom 2]]''' is launched.\n* 1963 \u2013 First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 \u2013 The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 \u2013 [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 \u2013 The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 \u2013 [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 \u2013 The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 \u2013 [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 \u2013 The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], [[email]], and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Arpanet]], the research-oriented prototype of the [[Internet]], was introduced.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n* The [[Manson Murders]] occurred between 8\u201310 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] & [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During the anniversary celebrations, French president [[Charles De Gaulle]] visited Canada, and caused a considerable uproar by declaring his support for Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois independence.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco in 1967, and the [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[upstate New York]] in 1969. [[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The arrival of the [[Beatles]] in the US during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the US]]\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The 60's{{sic}} were a leap in human consciousness.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], and many other [[singer-songwriters]] to the public.\n\n[[Girl group]]s and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], the [[The Dixie Cups|Dixie Cups]], the [[Ronettes]], and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were [[African-American]], but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], the [[The Angels (American group)|Angels]], and the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las]] also emerged during  this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early '60s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 60s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]],\" \"[[409 (song)|409]],\" and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]],\" all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]],\" [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]],\" and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[traffic accident]]s. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]],\" [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]],\" [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve]],\" the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las']] \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" and [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers']] \"[[Last Kiss]].\"\n\nWhile rock 'n' roll had \"disappeared\" from the U.S. charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a 2-1/2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in prior decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n'''Significant events in music in the 1960s:'''\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8\u00bd]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jet\u00e9e]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of light-weight and affordable cameras, the underground [[New American Cinema|avant-garde film]] movement thrived. Canada's [[Michael Snow]], Americans [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]. Notable films in this genre are: ''[[Dog Star Man]]''; ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]''; ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]''; ''[[Chelsea Girls]]''; ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]''; ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]''; ''[[Flaming Creatures]]''.\n\nAside of [[Walt Disney]]'s most important blockbusters ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', Animated feature films which are of notable status include ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'', ''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'', ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.\n\n\n====Significant events in the film industry in the 1960s====\n\n*Removal of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[Production Code]] in 1967.\n*The decline and end of the [[Studio system|Studio System]].\n*The rise of \"[[art house]]\" films and theaters.\n*The end of the [[classical hollywood cinema]] era.\n*The beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] Era due to the counterculture.\n*The rise of independent producers that worked outside the Studio System.\n*Move to all-color production in Hollywood films.\n*The invention of the [[Nagra]] 1/4\", sync-sound, portable open-reel tape deck.\n*[[Expo 67]] where new film formats like [[Imax]] were invented and new ways of displaying film were tested.\n*Flat-bed film editing tables appear, like the [[Steenbeck]], they eventually replace the [[Moviola]] editing platform.\n*The [[French New Wave]].\n*[[Direct Cinema]] and [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentaries.\n*The beginning of the [[Golden Age of Porn]] in 1969, which continued throughout the 1970s and into the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1960s in television}}\nThe most prominent American TV series of the 1960s include: ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]], [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. ''The Flintstones'' was a favoured show, receiving 420 million views an episode with an average of 69 million views a day.  Some programming such as ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls; making fun of world leaders, and questioning U.S. involvement in and escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n[[Walt Disney]], the founder of the [[Walt Disney Co.]] died on 15 December 1966, from a major tumor in his left lung.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1960s in fashion}}\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\n* [[The Beatles]] exerted an enormous influence on young men's fashions and hairstyles in the 1960s which included most notably the [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], the [[Beatle boots]] and the [[Nehru jacket]].\n* The [[hippie]] movement late in the decade also had a strong influence on clothing styles, including [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom jeans]], [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] fabrics, as well as [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] prints.\n* The [[bikini]] came into fashion in 1963 after being featured in the film ''[[Beach Party]]''.\n* [[Mary Quant]] invented the [[miniskirt]], which became one of the most popular fashion rages in the late 1960s among young women and teenage girls. Its popularity continued throughout the first half of the 1970s and then disappeared temporarily from mainstream fashion before making a comeback in the mid-1980s.\n* Men's mainstream hairstyles ranged from the [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], the [[crew cut]], the [[flattop]] hairstyle, the tapered hairstyle, and short, parted hair in the early part of the decade, to longer parted hairstyles with [[sideburns]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* Women's mainstream hairstyles ranged from [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], the bird's nest hairstyle, and the [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] hairstyle in the early part of the decade, to very short styles popularized by [[Twiggy]] and [[Mia Farrow]] in [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* African-American hairstyles for men and women included the [[afro]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Mop-top hair.jpg|The [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], which became popular due to the Beatles but was considered at the time a rebellious hairstyle, was particularly fashionable among young men during the decade\nFile:On the Beach at Tiberias.jpg|The [[bikini]] became a fashionable item in the Western world during the decade\nFile:Londons_Carnaby_Street,_1966.jpg|\"Swinging London\" fashions on [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1966\nFile:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|[[Tie-dye]] shirt\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also|List of years in literature#1960s}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Olympics====\nThere were six [[Olympic Games]] held during the decade.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant. Coached by [[John Wooden]], they were helped by [[Lew Alcindor]] and by [[Bill Walton]] to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qycPRAAACAAJ|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> Starting with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation |url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |work=History of the Flying Disc |accessdate=20 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> Two sports, the team sport of [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]] and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.

The decade was also labeled the [[Swinging London|Swinging Sixties]] because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time, but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music; from a folk music revival, to the Beatles revolution, to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Norms of all kinds were broken down, especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars.\n\nCommentator [[Christopher Booker]]<ref>[[Christopher Booker]]: ''The Neophiliacs:  A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties'', Gambit Incorporated, London, 1970</ref> described this era as a classical [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater [[Individualism|individual freedom]], broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several [[Western culture|Western]] nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] turned to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] in the early and mid-1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\n\nThe [[Cold War|confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union]] dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global [[superpower]] and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by [[proxy war]]s, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\n\nIn response to [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] campaigns from groups like the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-7,00.html|title=The Economy: We Are All Keynesians Now|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=1 January 2011|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|quote=Keynesianism made its biggest breakthrough under John Kennedy, who, as Arthur Schlesinger reports in A Thousand Days, \"was unquestionably the first Keynesian President.\"}}</ref> and staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], pushed for social reforms.  Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] including civil rights for [[African Americans]] and healthcare for [[Medicare (United States)|the elderly]] and [[Medicaid|the poor]]. Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] outraged student protestors around the globe.  The [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] upon working with underpaid [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|Tennessee garbage collectors]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]], and [[Chicago Seven|the police response towards protesters of the 1968 Democratic National Convention]], defined politics of violence in the United States.\n\nIn Western Europe and Japan, organizations such as [[Situationist International|those present at May 1968]], the [[Red Army Faction]], and the [[Zengakuren]] tested [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracy's]] ability to satisfy its marginalized or alienated citizenry amidst [[Advanced capitalism|post-industrial age hybrid capitalist economies]].

During the 1960s, various armed independence movements, most prominently led by [[communist]]-led parties who cooperated under the [[CONCP]] umbrella and pro-U.S. groups, became active in these areas, most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]].

Mao alleged that \"liberal bourgeois\" elements were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore [[capitalism]]. Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], [[West Bengal]], led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in August 1966 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was able to forge a connection. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 in France|May]] student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed capable of overthrowing the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]].

President Kennedy had plans to restore Sino-US relations, but his assassination, the war in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution put an end to that. Not until Richard Nixon took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n* Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S., as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]].

In his campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to \"get America moving again.\" His goal was economic growth of 4\u20136% per year and unemployment below 4%. To do this, he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment.

Fires had erupted on the river many times, including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that \"oozes rather than flows\" and in which a person \"does not drown but decays.\" This helped spur legislative action on water pollution control resulting in the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Hurricane Camille]] hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status. To date it is the strongest hurricane ever recorded at landfall in means of sustained windspeed in the Atlantic Basin, reaching sustained winds of 190&nbsp;mph and a low pressure of 905 mbs.

This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\".  Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American|black American]]s and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolent action|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included [[boycott]]s such as the successful [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955\u20131956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the [[Southwestern United States]], such as [[California]] with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>[http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html History | LULAC-League of United Latin American Citizens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v.

The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in [[Miami, Florida]].\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.  A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.  These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality.  This philosophy would be dominant again after [[AIDS]], but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close.  Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.  Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.  On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.  This uprising called the [[Stonewall Riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf U.S. Census Bureau Data https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n\n===Science===\n\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968 the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September, 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, [[Apollo 11]], the [[Moon landing|first human spaceflight landed on the Moon]]. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and the Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.\n\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 - The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 - The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 \u2013 [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 \u2013 First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 \u2013 Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n\n===Technology===\n\n====Automobiles====\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 \u2013 [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 \u2013 [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 \u2013 First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 \u2013 The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 \u2013 Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 \u2013 The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], '''[[Syncom 2]]''' is launched.\n* 1963 \u2013 First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 \u2013 The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 \u2013 [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 \u2013 The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 \u2013 [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 \u2013 The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 \u2013 [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 \u2013 The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], [[email]], and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Arpanet]], the research-oriented prototype of the [[Internet]], was introduced.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n* The [[Manson Murders]] occurred between 8\u201310 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] & [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During the anniversary celebrations, French president [[Charles De Gaulle]] visited Canada, and caused a considerable uproar by declaring his support for Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois independence.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco in 1967, and the [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[upstate New York]] in 1969. [[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The arrival of the [[Beatles]] in the US during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the US]]\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The 60's{{sic}} were a leap in human consciousness.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], and many other [[singer-songwriters]] to the public.\n\n[[Girl group]]s and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], the [[The Dixie Cups|Dixie Cups]], the [[Ronettes]], and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were [[African-American]], but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], the [[The Angels (American group)|Angels]], and the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las]] also emerged during  this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early '60s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 60s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]],\" \"[[409 (song)|409]],\" and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]],\" all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]],\" [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]],\" and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[traffic accident]]s. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]],\" [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]],\" [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve]],\" the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las']] \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" and [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers']] \"[[Last Kiss]].\"\n\nWhile rock 'n' roll had \"disappeared\" from the U.S. charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a 2-1/2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in prior decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n'''Significant events in music in the 1960s:'''\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8\u00bd]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jet\u00e9e]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of light-weight and affordable cameras, the underground [[New American Cinema|avant-garde film]] movement thrived. Canada's [[Michael Snow]], Americans [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]. Notable films in this genre are: ''[[Dog Star Man]]''; ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]''; ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]''; ''[[Chelsea Girls]]''; ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]''; ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]''; ''[[Flaming Creatures]]''.\n\nAside of [[Walt Disney]]'s most important blockbusters ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', Animated feature films which are of notable status include ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'', ''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'', ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.\n\n\n====Significant events in the film industry in the 1960s====\n\n*Removal of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[Production Code]] in 1967.\n*The decline and end of the [[Studio system|Studio System]].\n*The rise of \"[[art house]]\" films and theaters.\n*The end of the [[classical hollywood cinema]] era.\n*The beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] Era due to the counterculture.\n*The rise of independent producers that worked outside the Studio System.\n*Move to all-color production in Hollywood films.\n*The invention of the [[Nagra]] 1/4\", sync-sound, portable open-reel tape deck.\n*[[Expo 67]] where new film formats like [[Imax]] were invented and new ways of displaying film were tested.\n*Flat-bed film editing tables appear, like the [[Steenbeck]], they eventually replace the [[Moviola]] editing platform.\n*The [[French New Wave]].\n*[[Direct Cinema]] and [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentaries.\n*The beginning of the [[Golden Age of Porn]] in 1969, which continued throughout the 1970s and into the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1960s in television}}\nThe most prominent American TV series of the 1960s include: ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]], [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. ''The Flintstones'' was a favoured show, receiving 420 million views an episode with an average of 69 million views a day.  Some programming such as ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls; making fun of world leaders, and questioning U.S. involvement in and escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n[[Walt Disney]], the founder of the [[Walt Disney Co.]] died on 15 December 1966, from a major tumor in his left lung.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1960s in fashion}}\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\n* [[The Beatles]] exerted an enormous influence on young men's fashions and hairstyles in the 1960s which included most notably the [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], the [[Beatle boots]] and the [[Nehru jacket]].\n* The [[hippie]] movement late in the decade also had a strong influence on clothing styles, including [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom jeans]], [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] fabrics, as well as [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] prints.\n* The [[bikini]] came into fashion in 1963 after being featured in the film ''[[Beach Party]]''.\n* [[Mary Quant]] invented the [[miniskirt]], which became one of the most popular fashion rages in the late 1960s among young women and teenage girls. Its popularity continued throughout the first half of the 1970s and then disappeared temporarily from mainstream fashion before making a comeback in the mid-1980s.\n* Men's mainstream hairstyles ranged from the [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], the [[crew cut]], the [[flattop]] hairstyle, the tapered hairstyle, and short, parted hair in the early part of the decade, to longer parted hairstyles with [[sideburns]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* Women's mainstream hairstyles ranged from [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], the bird's nest hairstyle, and the [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] hairstyle in the early part of the decade, to very short styles popularized by [[Twiggy]] and [[Mia Farrow]] in [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* African-American hairstyles for men and women included the [[afro]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Mop-top hair.jpg|The [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], which became popular due to the Beatles but was considered at the time a rebellious hairstyle, was particularly fashionable among young men during the decade\nFile:On the Beach at Tiberias.jpg|The [[bikini]] became a fashionable item in the Western world during the decade\nFile:Londons_Carnaby_Street,_1966.jpg|\"Swinging London\" fashions on [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1966\nFile:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|[[Tie-dye]] shirt\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also|List of years in literature#1960s}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Olympics====\nThere were six [[Olympic Games]] held during the decade.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant. Coached by [[John Wooden]], they were helped by [[Lew Alcindor]] and by [[Bill Walton]] to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qycPRAAACAAJ|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> Starting with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation |url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |work=History of the Flying Disc |accessdate=20 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> Two sports, the team sport of [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]] and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.

Based on the 209-0 series, these trains have end doors for use in emergencies inside tunnels. These sets were based at JR East's Matsudo depot. These train sets have since been withdrawn from the Joban Line in October 2018 and reallocated to the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid)]] in December 2018, being based at JR East's Toyoda Depot after the reallocation. Operations officially started on the Chuo Line Rapid Service in March 2019.\n\nWhile these sets usually operate only between Tokyo and Takao, on rare occasions (such as a shortage of train sets on the Ome Line due to an accident) they may operate on the [[Ome Line]] as far as Ome station as a substitute. Furthermore, unlike the E233 series in use, due to the lack of passenger-operated door controls, all doors open on these sets while in use on the Ome Line.\n\n===Formation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"border-bottom:solid 5px #F15A22;\"\n|style=\"background-color:#ccc;\"|&nbsp;\n|colspan=\"10\"|<div style=\"float:left;\">\u2190 T\u014dky\u014d</div><div style=\"float:right;\">\u014ctsuki \u2192</div>\n|-\n!

Based on the 209-0 series, these trains have end doors for use in emergencies inside tunnels. These sets were based at JR East's Matsudo depot. These train sets have since been withdrawn from the Joban Line in October 2018 and reallocated to the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid)]] in December 2018, being based at JR East's Toyoda Depot after the reallocation. Operations officially started on the Chuo Line Rapid Service in March 2019.\n\nWhile these sets usually operate only between Tokyo and Takao, on rare occasions (such as a shortage of train sets on the Ome Line due to an accident) they may operate on the [[Ome Line]] as far as Ome station as a substitute.

France fared poorly, with few gains and heavy debts, which were contributing causes of [[French Revolution|France's own revolution]] and eventual transition to a Republic.\n\nThe American relationship with France has been peaceful except for the [[Quasi War]] in 1798-99, and fighting against [[Vichy France]] (while supporting [[Free France]]) during [[World War II]].  The relationship had always been important for both nations.\n\nIn the 21st Century, differences over the [[Iraq War]] led each country to have lowered favorability ratings of the other.

However, beginning in earnest following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England (1688), the simmering dynastic, religious, and factional rivalries between the Protestant British and Catholic French in both Europe and the Americas triggered four \"[[French and Indian Wars]]\" fought largely on American soil ([[King William's War]], 1689\u201397; [[Queen Anne's War]], 1702\u201313; [[King George's War]], 1744\u201348; and, finally the [[Seven Years' War]], 1756\u201363). Great Britain finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763 following French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Within a decade, the British colonies were in open revolt, and France retaliated by secretly supplying the independence movement with troops and war materials.\n\n[[File:First meeting of Washington and Lafayette, Currier and Ives 1876.jpg|thumb|The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visiting [[George Washington]] in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.]]\nAfter [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] declared independence in July 1776, its agents in Paris recruited officers for the [[Continental Army]], notably the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who served with distinction as a major general. Despite a lingering distrust of France, the agents also requested a formal alliance. After readying their fleet and being impressed by the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the French on February 6, 1778, concluded treaties of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States \u2013 France)|commerce]] and [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] that bound them to fight Britain until independence of the United States was assured.<ref>C. H. Van Tyne, \"Influences which Determined the French Government to Make the Treaty with America, 1778,\"\n''American Historical Review'' (1916) 21#3 pp. 528\u2013541 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1835010 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>\n\nThe military alliance began poorly. French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] sailed to North America with a fleet in 1778, and began a joint effort with American General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to capture a British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. D'Estaing broke off the operation to confront a British fleet, and then, despite pleas from Sullivan and Lafayette, sailed away to Boston for repairs. Without naval support, the plan collapsed, and American forces under Sullivan had to conduct a fighting retreat alone. American outrage was widespread, and several French sailors were killed in anti-French riots. D'Estaing's actions in a [[Siege of Savannah|disastrous siege]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] further undermined Franco-American relations.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, '' The French Navy and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774\u20131787'' (1975)</ref>\n\n[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] where the French Navy defeated the Royal Navy in 1781]]\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Yorktown|Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]] depicting the English surrendering to French (left) and American (right) troops.]]\nThe alliance improved with the arrival in the United States in 1780 of the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who maintained a good working relationship with General Washington. French naval actions at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] made possible the decisive Franco\u2013American victory at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, effectively ending the war as far as the Americans were concerned.  The French went on fighting, losing a naval battle to Britain in 1782.\n\nThe Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric.  Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155..

Indeed, the French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] had maneuvered so that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow the advice of the French. However, the American commissioners, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], and particularly [[John Jay]], correctly realized that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would get better terms directly from Britain itself. The key episodes came in September, 1782, when Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that there would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an [[Indian barrier state]] and keep the Americans from the Mississippi River or New Orleans, which were under Spanish control. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322-345.</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada. The northern boundary would be almost the same as today.<ref>In 1842 some shifts were made in Maine and Minnesota. {{cite book|author=William E.

It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as it indeed came to pass.  Trade with France was always on a much smaller scale.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

Albert, eds., ''Peace and the Peacemakers: The Treatyof 1783'' (1986)</ref>\n\n== The French Revolution and Napoleon ==\nSix years later, the [[French Revolution]] toppled the Bourbon regime. At first, the United States was quite sympathetic to the new situation in France, where the [[hereditary monarchy]] was replaced by a [[French First Republic|constitutional republic]]. However, in the matter of a few years, the situation in France turned sour, as foreign powers tried to invade France and King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was accused of high treason. The French revolutionary government then became increasingly authoritarian and brutal, which dissipated some of the United States' warmth for France.\n\nA crisis emerged in 1793 when France found itself at war again with Great Britain and its allies, this time after the French revolutionary government had executed the king. The new federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond. Should the United States recognize the radical government of France by accepting a diplomatic representative from it? Was the United States obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France? The treaty had been called \"military and economic\", and as the United States had not finished paying off the French loan, would the military alliance be ignored as well?  President [[George Washington]] (responding to advice from both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]) recognized the French government, but did not support France in the war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. The proclamation was issued and declared without Congressional approval. Congress instead acquiesced, and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens to participate in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operation for either side.

The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams' administration.  Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent [[William Vans Murray]] to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the [[Convention of 1800]] (also called the \"Treaty of Mortefontaine\") of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 \"French Spoliation Claims\" of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims.

He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not powerful France in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in [[St. Domingue]], modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte's North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million.  British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dlK8PIAJ5oC&pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55\u201362|isbn=9780742565340}}</ref>\n\nBritain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Great Britain, but saw Britain (with its monarchism, aristocracy and great navy and position in Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Both Britain and France infringed on U.S. maritime rights. The British infringed more and also impressed thousands of American sailors into the Royal Navy; France never did anything like impressment.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812'' (2012) pp 17-47</ref>  Jefferson signed the [[Embargo Act]] in 1807, which forbade all exports and imports.

Both Britain and France remained hostile to the United States. The [[War of 1812]] was the logical extension of the embargo program as the United States declared war on Britain.

The United States, in cooperation with Great Britain, issued the \"[[Monroe Doctrine]]\" in 1823 to keep European powers, especially Spain but also France, from seizing lands in the New World.  The French had a strong interest in expanding commercial opportunity in Latin America, especially as the Spanish role was faltering.  There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, but no actual operations ever took place.

Jackson's political opponents blocked any legislation.  France was annoyed but finally voted the money if the United States apologized.  Jackson refused to apologize, and diplomatic relations were broken off until in December 1835 Jackson did offer some friendlier words.

From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in Europe, which endeared it to the United States. Many French people held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Few French people emigrated to the United States. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals.

However, the two countries clashed over France's policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the entire French war. The burning ambition of French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]: \"Even God was satisfied with [[Ten Commandments]], but Wilson insists on fourteen\" (a reference to Wilson's \"[[Fourteen Points]]\"). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany.\n\nClemenceau was also determined that a buffer state consisting of the German territory [[Rhineland|west of the Rhine River]] should be established under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] agreed that the United States and Great Britain, by treaty, would guarantee France against German aggression.  Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It failed because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.<ref>Lloyd E.

Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany's full integration into the world economic and political community as an equal partner.  One result was that in the 1920s the French deeply distrusted the Americans, who were loaning money to Germany (which Germany used to pay its reparations to France and other Allies), while demanding that France repay its war loans from Washington.<ref>Zahniser, 1987</ref><ref>Melvyn Leffler, ''The Elusive Quest: America's Pursuit of European Stability and French Security, 1919-1933'' (1979) [https://www.amazon.com/Elusive-Quest-Americas-Stability-1919-1933/dp/0807813338/ excerpt and text search]</ref><ref>Stephen Schuker, ''The End of French Predominance in Europe: The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (1976) [https://www.amazon.com/End-French-Predominance-Europe-Financial/dp/1597403989/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Interwar years (1919\u201338) ==\n[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|The French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Known as the [[Lost Generation]], their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.\n\nHowever, [[anti-Americanism]] came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional [[Culture of France|French values]], customs, and popular literature.<ref>David Strauss, \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism In France: French Intellectuals and the American Film Industry, 1927\u20131932,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' (177) 10#4 pp 752\u2013759\n</ref> The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened a $4 billion [[Disneyland Paris]] theme park in 1992.

After Normandy the Americans and the Allies knew it was only a matter of time before the Nazis lost. Eisenhower did give De Gaulle his word that Paris would be liberated by the French as the Americans had no interest in Paris, a city they considered lacking tactical value. It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let De Gaulle's FFI take the charge. There was one important aspect of Paris that did seem to matter to everyone: it was its historical and cultural significance. Hitler had given the order to bomb and burn Paris to the ground; he wanted to make it a second [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. The Americans and the Allies could not let this happen.<ref name=\"historynet.com\">[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-the-liberation-of-paris.htm].

Patton]] was at the command of the U.S. Third Army that swept across northern France. It campaigned in Lorraine for some time, but it was one of the least successful of Patton's career. While in Lorraine, he annexed the Maj. Gen. Phillipe Leclerc's battalion into his army.<ref name=\"historynet.com\"/> Leclerc did not respect his American counterparts because like the British he thought that they were new to the war. Therefore, he thought the Americans did not know what they were doing on the field. After being more trouble than help Patton let Leclerc go for Paris. The French then went on to liberate Paris from the east while the 4th U.S. Infantry (originally part of Patton's Army) came from the west. Because of Eisenhower's deal with De Gaulle, the Liberation was left to the French's 2nd armored division.<ref name=\"historynet.com\" /><ref name=\"rfi.fr\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapage.noos.fr/liberation_de_paris2/maincourante252.htm |title=19-25 ao\u00fbt 1944...

'' (1965)</ref>\n\n===Roosevelt opposes French colonies in Asia===\nRoosevelt was strongly committed to terminating European colonialism in Asia, especially French Indochina. He wanted to put it under an international trusteeship. He wanted the United States to work closely with China to become the policeman for the region and stabilize it; the U.S. would provide suitable financing. The scheme was directly contrary to the plans of the Free French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to abandon Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on [[Chiang Kai-shek]] the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressure in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long-range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia, and China was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia.<ref>Walter LaFeber, \"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\" ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1852060 online]</ref>\n\n== Postwar years ==\nIn the postwar years, both cooperation and discord persisted. After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948\u201351). There was post-Marshall aid (1951\u201355) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator [[Jean Monnet]] set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irwin M.

The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry.  France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F.

Johnson]], 1967]]\n\nWhile occasional tensions surfaced between the governments, the French public, except for the Communists, generally had a good opinion of the United States throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Despite some cultural friction, the United States was seen as a benevolent giant, the land of modernity, and French youth took a taste to American culture such as [[chewing gum]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[rock and roll]].\n\n===De Gaulle===\nIn the 1950s France sought American help in developing nuclear weapons; Eisenhower rejected the overtures for four reasons. Before 1958, he was troubled by the political instability of the [[French Fourth Republic]] and worried that it might use nuclear weapons in its colonial wars in Vietnam and Algeria. [[Charles de Gaulle]] brought stability to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own ''[[Force de frappe]].'' Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO.  Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.<ref>Keith W. Baum,  \"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd: The Eisenhower Administration, France, and Nuclear Weapons.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20#2 (1990): 315-328. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550617 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCharles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the [[European Economic Community]]. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle's decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and forced it to move its headquarters to Belgium.  De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France's international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Third World]] countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France's traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds. ''De Gaulle and the United States: a centennial reappraisal'' (Berg Publishers, 1994).</ref>\n\nThe two nations differed over the waging of the [[Vietnam War]], in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.<ref>Yuko Torikata,  \"Reexamining de Gaulle's peace initiative on the Vietnam War.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 31.5 (2007): 909-938.</ref><ref>Marianna P.

Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the [[European Union]] as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to [[NATO]]. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]] and the desirability of a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the [[Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline|Siberia-Europe pipeline]]. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.<ref>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, eds., ''Germany unified and Europe transformed: a study in statecraft'' (Harvard UP, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Anti-Americanism==\n{{Main|Anti-Americanism#France}}\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power.  He writes in 2013:\n\n{{quote|America functioned as the \"other\" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, \"The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power,\" ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41-45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Kuisel identifies several strong pull effects:\n\n{{quote|American products often carried a representational or symbolic quality. They encoded messages like modernity, youthfulness, rebellion, transgression, status, and freedom ... There was the linkage with political and economic power: historically culture has followed power. Thus Europeans learned English because it is a necessary skill in a globalized environment featuring American technology, education, and business. Similarly the size and power of U.S. multinationals, like that of the global giant Coca-Cola, helped American products win market shares. Finally, it must be acknowledged, that there has been something inherently appealing about what we make and sell. Europeans liked Broadway musicals, TV shows, and fashions. We know how to make and market what others want.<ref>Kuisel, pp 43-44.</ref>}}\n\n== Middle East conflict ==\nFrance under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] supported the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] in Iraq as a major participant under [[Operation Daguet]]. The French [[Assemblee Nationale]] even took the \"unprecedented decision\" to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.<ref>Reynolds, David One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W.W.Norton and Co. p. 588</ref>\n\n===9-11===\n{{Further|September 11 attacks|War on terror}}\nAll the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the barbaric acts of the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001.  President [[Jacques Chirac]] \u2014later known for his frosty relationship with President [[George W. Bush]]\u2014ordered the [[French secret services]] to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s [[War on Terror]].  However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had to deal with a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate.  As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall, ed.|title=France and the Americas, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA881|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=878\u201383|isbn=9781851094110}}</ref><ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \"Old wine and old bottles: anti-Americanism in Britain, France and Germany.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 7.2 (2009): 148-162.</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\n\nIn March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. [[Invasion of Iraq (2003)|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/11/sprj.irq.main/ |title=CNN.com \u2013 White House all but concedes U.N. defeat \u2013 Mar. 12, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | date=2003-03-11}}</ref> During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies.

This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the [[French forces in Afghanistan]]) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.\n\nAs the Iraq War progressed, relations between the two nations began to improve.

France was the first ally of the new United States. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|The 1778 treaty and military support]] proved decisive in the American victory over Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  France fared poorly, with few gains and heavy debts, which were contributing causes of [[French Revolution|France's own revolution]] and eventual transition to a Republic.\n\nThe American relationship with France has been peaceful except for the [[Quasi War]] in 1798-99, and fighting against [[Vichy France]] (while supporting [[Free France]]) during [[World War II]].  The relationship had always been important for both nations.\n\nIn the 21st Century, differences over the [[Iraq War]] led each country to have lowered favorability ratings of the other.

However, beginning in earnest following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England (1688), the simmering dynastic, religious, and factional rivalries between the Protestant British and Catholic French in both Europe and the Americas triggered four \"[[French and Indian Wars]]\" fought largely on American soil ([[King William's War]], 1689\u201397; [[Queen Anne's War]], 1702\u201313; [[King George's War]], 1744\u201348; and, finally the [[Seven Years' War]], 1756\u201363). Great Britain finally removed the French from continental North America in 1763 following French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Within a decade, the British colonies were in open revolt, and France retaliated by secretly supplying the independence movement with troops and war materials.\n\n[[File:First meeting of Washington and Lafayette, Currier and Ives 1876.jpg|thumb|The [[Marquis de Lafayette]] visiting [[George Washington]] in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War.]]\nAfter [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] declared independence in July 1776, its agents in Paris recruited officers for the [[Continental Army]], notably the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who served with distinction as a major general. Despite a lingering distrust of France, the agents also requested a formal alliance. After readying their fleet and being impressed by the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, the French on February 6, 1778, concluded treaties of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States \u2013 France)|commerce]] and [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|alliance]] that bound them to fight Britain until independence of the United States was assured.<ref>C. H. Van Tyne, \"Influences which Determined the French Government to Make the Treaty with America, 1778,\"\n''American Historical Review'' (1916) 21#3 pp. 528\u2013541 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1835010 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Jonathan R. Dull, ''A Diplomatic History of American Revolution'' (1985)</ref>\n\nThe military alliance began poorly. French Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] sailed to North America with a fleet in 1778, and began a joint effort with American General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to capture a British outpost at [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. D'Estaing broke off the operation to confront a British fleet, and then, despite pleas from Sullivan and Lafayette, sailed away to Boston for repairs. Without naval support, the plan collapsed, and American forces under Sullivan had to conduct a fighting retreat alone. American outrage was widespread, and several French sailors were killed in anti-French riots. D'Estaing's actions in a [[Siege of Savannah|disastrous siege]] at [[Savannah, Georgia]] further undermined Franco-American relations.<ref>Jonathan R. Dull, '' The French Navy and American Independence: A Study of Arms and Diplomacy, 1774\u20131787'' (1975)</ref>\n\n[[File:BattleOfVirginiaCapes.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] where the French Navy defeated the Royal Navy in 1781]]\n[[File:Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Yorktown|Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]] depicting the English surrendering to French (left) and American (right) troops.]]\nThe alliance improved with the arrival in the United States in 1780 of the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who maintained a good working relationship with General Washington. French naval actions at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] made possible the decisive Franco\u2013American victory at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in October 1781, effectively ending the war as far as the Americans were concerned.  The French went on fighting, losing a naval battle to Britain in 1782.\n\nThe Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric.  Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war while most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155..

Indeed, the French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] had maneuvered so that the American Congress ordered its delegation to follow the advice of the French. However, the American commissioners, [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Adams]], and particularly [[John Jay]], correctly realized that France did not want a strong United States. They realized that they would get better terms directly from Britain itself. The key episodes came in September, 1782, when Vergennes proposed a solution that was strongly opposed by the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it captured Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that there would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an [[Indian barrier state]] and keep the Americans from the Mississippi River or New Orleans, which were under Spanish control. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in full charge of the British negotiations and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref>Charles R. Ritcheson, \"The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality.\" ''International History Review'' 5#3 (1983): 322-345.</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as it indeed came to pass.  Trade with France was always on a much smaller scale.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

At first, the United States was quite sympathetic to the new situation in France, where the [[hereditary monarchy]] was replaced by a [[French First Republic|constitutional republic]]. However, in the matter of a few years, the situation in France turned sour, as foreign powers tried to invade France and King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was accused of high treason. The French revolutionary government then became increasingly authoritarian and brutal, which dissipated some of the United States' warmth for France.\n\nA crisis emerged in 1793 when France found itself at war again with Great Britain and its allies, this time after the French revolutionary government had executed the king. The new federal government in the United States was uncertain how to respond. Should the United States recognize the radical government of France by accepting a diplomatic representative from it? Was the United States obliged by the alliance of 1778 to go to war on the side of France? The treaty had been called \"military and economic\", and as the United States had not finished paying off the French loan, would the military alliance be ignored as well?  President [[George Washington]] (responding to advice from both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]) recognized the French government, but did not support France in the war with Britain, as expressed in his 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. The proclamation was issued and declared without Congressional approval. Congress instead acquiesced, and a year later passed a neutrality act forbidding U.S. citizens to participate in the war and prohibiting the use of U.S. soil as a base of operation for either side. Thus, the revolutionary government viewed Washington's policy as partial to the enemy.<ref>John C. Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789-1801'' (1960)  [https://archive.org/details/federalistera197000675mbp online] pp 126-39.</ref>\n\nThe first challenge to U.S. neutrality came from France, when its first diplomatic representative, the brash [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]], toured the United States to organize U.S. expeditions against Spain and Britain. Exasperated, Washington demanded Gen\u00eat's recall, but by then the French Revolution had taken yet another turn and the new French ministers arrived to arrest Gen\u00eat. Washington refused to extradite Gen\u00eat (knowing he would otherwise be guillotined). Gen\u00eat became a U.S. citizen.<ref>Sioli, Marco. \"Citizen Gen\u00eat and Political Struggle in the Early American Republic.\" ''Revue fran\u00e7aise d'\u00e9tudes am\u00e9ricaines'' (1995): 259-267. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/rfea_0397-7870_1995_num_64_1_1582 Online free in English]</ref>\n\nFrance regarded [[Jay's Treaty]] (November 1794) between Britain and the United States as hostile.  It opened a decade of trade when France was at war with Britain.\n\n[[Timothy Pickering]] (1745-1829) was the third [[United States Secretary of State]], serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Washington and [[John Adams]].  Biographer Gerald Clarfield says he was a \"quick-tempered, self-righteous, frank, and aggressive Anglophile,\" who handled the French poorly. In response the French envoy Pierre Adet repeatedly provoked Pickering into embarrassing situations, then ridiculed his blunderings and blusterings to appeal to Republican Party opponents of the Administration.<ref>Gerard H. Clarfield, ''Timothy Pickering and American Diplomacy, 1795-1800'' (1969).</ref>\n\n===Quasi War 1798\u20131800===\nTo overcome this resentment John Adams sent a special mission to Paris in 1797 to meet the French foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]]. The American delegation was shocked, however, when it was demanded that they pay monetary bribes in order to meet and secure a deal with the French government. Adams exposed the episode, known as the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\", which greatly offended Americans even though such bribery was not uncommon among the courts of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |title=American Foreign Relations: A History, to 1920 |last=Paterson |first=Thomas G. |author2=Clifford, J.

The unexpected fighting ability of the U.S. Navy, which destroyed the French West Indian trade, together with the growing weaknesses and final overthrow of the ruling Directory in France, led Talleyrand to reopen negotiations. At the same time, President Adams feuded with Hamilton over control of the Adams' administration.  Adams took sudden and unexpected action, rejecting the anti-French hawks in his own party and offering peace to France. In 1800 he sent [[William Vans Murray]] to France to negotiate peace; Federalists cried betrayal. The subsequent negotiations, embodied in the [[Convention of 1800]] (also called the \"Treaty of Mortefontaine\") of September 30, 1800, affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the alliance with France of 1778. The treaty failed to provide compensation for the $20,000,000 \"French Spoliation Claims\" of the United States; the U.S. government eventually paid these claims. The Convention of 1800 ensured that the United States would remain neutral toward France in the wars of Napoleon and ended the \"entangling\" French alliance with the United States.<ref>E.

He envisioned it as the base (along with Haiti) of a New World empire. Louisiana would be a granary providing food to the enslaved labor force in the West Indies. President Jefferson could tolerate weak Spain but not powerful France in the west. He considered war to prevent French control of the Mississippi River. Jefferson sent his close friend, James Monroe, to France to buy as much of the land around New Orleans as he could. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to sell the entire territory. Because of an insuppressible slave rebellion in [[St. Domingue]], modern-day Haiti, among other reasons, Bonaparte's North American plans collapsed. To keep Louisiana out of British hands in an approaching war he sold it in April 1803 to the United States for $15 million.  British bankers financed the deal, taking American government bonds and shipping gold to Paris. The size of the United States was doubled without going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard Jones|title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dlK8PIAJ5oC&pg=PA55|year=2009|pages=55\u201362|isbn=9780742565340}}</ref>\n\nBritain and France resumed their war in 1803, just after the Purchase. Both challenged American neutrality and tried to disrupt trade with its enemy. The presupposition was that small neutral nations could benefit from the wars of the great powers. Jefferson distrusted both Napoleon and Great Britain, but saw Britain (with its monarchism, aristocracy and great navy and position in Canada) as the more immediate threat to American interests. Therefore, he and Madison took a generally pro-French position and used the embargo to hurt British trade. Both Britain and France infringed on U.S. maritime rights. The British infringed more and also impressed thousands of American sailors into the Royal Navy; France never did anything like impressment.<ref>J. C. A. Stagg, ''The War of 1812'' (2012) pp 17-47</ref>  Jefferson signed the [[Embargo Act]] in 1807, which forbade all exports and imports. Designed to hurt the British, it hurt American commerce far more. The destructive Embargo Act, which had brought U.S. trade to a standstill, was rescinded in 1809, as Jefferson left office. Both Britain and France remained hostile to the United States. The [[War of 1812]] was the logical extension of the embargo program as the United States declared war on Britain. However, there was never any sense of being an ally of France and no effort was made to coordinate military activity.<ref>Lawrence S.

The U.S. inherited the [[French colonization of Texas|French claims]] to Texas, then in the 1819 [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] traded these (and a little of the Mississippi drainage itself) in return for American possession of Florida, where American settlers and the U.S. Army were already encroaching, and acquisition of Spain's weak claims to the Pacific Northwest.

The United States, in cooperation with Great Britain, issued the \"[[Monroe Doctrine]]\" in 1823 to keep European powers, especially Spain but also France, from seizing lands in the New World.  The French had a strong interest in expanding commercial opportunity in Latin America, especially as the Spanish role was faltering.  There was a desire among top French officials that some of the newly independent countries in Latin America might select a Bourbon king, but no actual operations ever took place.  French officials ignored the American position. France and Austria, two reactionary monarchies, strenuously opposed American republicanism and wanted the United States to have no voice whatsoever in European affairs.<ref>Dexter Perkins,  \"Europe, Spanish America, and the Monroe Doctrine.\" ''American Historical Review'' 27#2 (1922): 207-218.

France did pay European claims, but refused to pay the United States.  President Andrew Jackson was livid, In 1834 ordered the U.S. Navy to stand by and asked Congress for legislation.  Jackson's political opponents blocked any legislation.  France was annoyed but finally voted the money if the United States apologized.  Jackson refused to apologize, and diplomatic relations were broken off until in December 1835 Jackson did offer some friendlier words.  The British mediated, France paid the money, and cordial relations were resumed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Greg H.

From 1870 until 1918, France was the only major republic in Europe, which endeared it to the United States. Many French people held the United States in high esteem, as a land of opportunity and as a source of modern ideas. Few French people emigrated to the United States. Intellectuals, however, saw the United States as a land built on crass materialism, lacking in a significant culture, and boasting of its distrust of intellectuals. Very few self-styled French intellectuals were admirers.<ref>Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin, ''Hating America: A History'' (2005) p 133.</ref>\n\nIn 1906, when Germany challenged French influence in [[Morocco]] (''see'' [[Tangier Crisis]] and [[Agadir Crisis]]), President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sided with the French.

The French were annoyed that so many Americans were going to Germany for post-graduate education, and discussed how to attract more Americans.

However, the two countries clashed over France's policy to weaken Germany and make it pay for the entire French war. The burning ambition of French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] was to ensure the security of France in the future; his formula was not friendship with Germany restitution, reparations, and guarantees. Clemenceau had little confidence in what he considered to be the unrealistic and utopian principles of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]: \"Even God was satisfied with [[Ten Commandments]], but Wilson insists on fourteen\" (a reference to Wilson's \"[[Fourteen Points]]\"). The two nations disagreed on debts, reparations, and restraints on Germany.\n\nClemenceau was also determined that a buffer state consisting of the German territory [[Rhineland|west of the Rhine River]] should be established under the aegis of France. In the eyes of the U.S. and British representatives, such a crass violation of the principle of self-determination would only breed future wars, and a compromise was therefore offered Clemenceau, which he accepted. The territory in question was to be occupied by Allied troops for a period of five to fifteen years, and a zone extending fifty kilometers east of the Rhine was to be demilitarized. Wilson and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] agreed that the United States and Great Britain, by treaty, would guarantee France against German aggression.  Republican leaders in Washington were willing to support a security treaty with France. It failed because Wilson insisted on linking it to the Versailles Treaty, which the Republicans would not accept without certain amendments Wilson refused to allow.<ref>Lloyd E.

Blumenthal agrees with Wilson that peace and prosperity required Germany's full integration into the world economic and political community as an equal partner.  One result was that in the 1920s the French deeply distrusted the Americans, who were loaning money to Germany (which Germany used to pay its reparations to France and other Allies), while demanding that France repay its war loans from Washington.<ref>Zahniser, 1987</ref><ref>Melvyn Leffler, ''The Elusive Quest: America's Pursuit of European Stability and French Security, 1919-1933'' (1979) [https://www.amazon.com/Elusive-Quest-Americas-Stability-1919-1933/dp/0807813338/ excerpt and text search]</ref><ref>Stephen Schuker, ''The End of French Predominance in Europe: The Financial Crisis of 1924 and the Adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (1976) [https://www.amazon.com/End-French-Predominance-Europe-Financial/dp/1597403989/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Interwar years (1919\u201338) ==\n[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|The French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Beginning in the 1920s, U.S. intellectuals, painters, writers, and tourists were drawn to French art, literature, philosophy, theatre, cinema, fashion, wines, and cuisine.\n\nA number of American artists, such as [[Josephine Baker]], experienced popular success in France. Paris was also quite welcoming to American [[jazz]] music and black artists in particular, as France, unlike a significant part of the United States at the time, had no racial discrimination laws. Numerous writers such as [[William Faulkner]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and others were deeply influenced by their experiences of French life.  Known as the [[Lost Generation]], their time in Paris was documented by Hemingway in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]''.\n\nHowever, [[anti-Americanism]] came of age in the 1920s, as many French traditionalists were alarmed at the power of Hollywood and warned that America represented modernity, which in turn threatened traditional [[Culture of France|French values]], customs, and popular literature.<ref>David Strauss, \"The Rise of Anti-Americanism In France: French Intellectuals and the American Film Industry, 1927\u20131932,\" ''Journal of Popular Culture'' (177) 10#4 pp 752\u2013759\n</ref> The alarm of American influence escalated half a century later when Americans opened a $4 billion [[Disneyland Paris]] theme park in 1992.

The successful performance of German warplanes during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339) suddenly forced France to realize its military inferiority.  Germany had better warplanes,  more of them, pilots with wartime experience in Spain, and much more efficient factories. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange.

This led the Roosevelt administration to maintain diplomatic relations. FDR appointed his close associate Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] as ambassador. The Vichy regime was officially neutral but it was helping Germany. The United States severed diplomatic relations in late 1942 when Germany took direct control of areas that Vichy had ruled, and Vichy France became a Nazi [[puppet state]].<ref>William L.

After Normandy the Americans and the Allies knew it was only a matter of time before the Nazis lost. Eisenhower did give De Gaulle his word that Paris would be liberated by the French as the Americans had no interest in Paris, a city they considered lacking tactical value. It was therefore easy for Eisenhower to let De Gaulle's FFI take the charge. There was one important aspect of Paris that did seem to matter to everyone: it was its historical and cultural significance. Hitler had given the order to bomb and burn Paris to the ground; he wanted to make it a second [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]].

He wanted to put it under an international trusteeship. He wanted the United States to work closely with China to become the policeman for the region and stabilize it; the U.S. would provide suitable financing. The scheme was directly contrary to the plans of the Free French; de Gaulle had a grand vision of the French overseas empire as the base for his return to defeat Vichy France. Roosevelt could not abide de Gaulle, but Winston Churchill realized that Britain needed French help to reestablish its position in Europe after the war. He and the British foreign office decided to work closely with de Gaulle to achieve that goal, and therefore they had to abandon Roosevelt's decolonization scheme. In doing so, they had considerable support from like-minded American officials. The basic weakness of Roosevelt's scheme was its dependence on [[Chiang Kai-shek]] the ruler of China. Chiang's regime virtually collapsed under Japanese pressure in 1944, and Japan overran the American airbases that were built to attack Japan. The Pentagon's plans to use China as a base to destroy Japan collapsed, so the U.S. Air Force turned its attention to attacking Japan with very long-range B-29 bombers based in the Pacific. The American military no longer needed China or Southeast Asia, and China was too weak to be a policeman. With the defeat of Japan, Britain took over Southeast Asia and returned Indochina to France. Roosevelt realized his trusteeship plan was dead and accepted the British-French actions as necessary to stabilize Southeast Asia.<ref>Walter LaFeber, \"Roosevelt, Churchill, and Indochina: 1942-45\" ''American Historical Review'' (1975) 80#5 pp 1277-1295.

After de Gaulle left office in January 1946, the logjam was broken in terms of financial aid.  Lend Lease had barely restarted when it was unexpectedly ended in August 1945. The U.S.  Army shipped in food, 1944-46. U.S. Treasury loans and cash grants were given in 1945-47, and especially the Marshall Plan gave large sums (1948\u201351). There was post-Marshall aid (1951\u201355) designed to help France rearm and provide massive support for its war in Indochina. Apart from low-interest loans, the other funds were grants that did not involve repayment.  The debts left over from World War I, whose payment had been suspended since 1931, was renegotiated in the [[Blum-Byrnes agreement]] of 1946. The United States forgave all $2.8 billion in debt from the First World War, and gave France a new loan of $650 million. In return French negotiator [[Jean Monnet]] set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Irwin M.

The Marshall Plan set up intensive tours of American industry.  France sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F.

Johnson]], 1967]]\n\nWhile occasional tensions surfaced between the governments, the French public, except for the Communists, generally had a good opinion of the United States throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Despite some cultural friction, the United States was seen as a benevolent giant, the land of modernity, and French youth took a taste to American culture such as [[chewing gum]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[rock and roll]].\n\n===De Gaulle===\nIn the 1950s France sought American help in developing nuclear weapons; Eisenhower rejected the overtures for four reasons. Before 1958, he was troubled by the political instability of the [[French Fourth Republic]] and worried that it might use nuclear weapons in its colonial wars in Vietnam and Algeria. [[Charles de Gaulle]] brought stability to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] starting in 1958, but Eisenhower was still hesitant to assist in the nuclearization of France. De Gaulle wanted to challenge the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on Western weapons by having his own ''[[Force de frappe]].'' Eisenhower feared his grandiose plans to use the bombs to restore French grandeur would weaken NATO.  Furthermore, Eisenhower wanted to discourage the proliferation of nuclear arms anywhere.<ref>Keith W. Baum,  \"Two's Company, Three's a Crowd: The Eisenhower Administration, France, and Nuclear Weapons.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20#2 (1990): 315-328. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27550617 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nCharles de Gaulle also quarreled with Washington over the admission of Britain into the [[European Economic Community]]. These and other tensions led to de Gaulle's decision in 1966 to withdraw French forces from the integrated military structure of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] and forced it to move its headquarters to Belgium.  De Gaulle's foreign policy was centered on an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, which would increase France's international prestige in relative terms. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to a leading first-world power with a large following among certain [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Third World]] countries. The nations de Gaulle considered potential participants in this grouping were those in France's traditional spheres of influence, Africa and the Middle East.<ref>Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds. ''De Gaulle and the United States: a centennial reappraisal'' (Berg Publishers, 1994).</ref>\n\nThe two nations differed over the waging of the [[Vietnam War]], in part because French leaders were convinced that the United States could not win. The recent French experience with the [[Algerian War of Independence]] was that it was impossible, in the long run, for a democracy to impose by force a government over a foreign population without considerable manpower and probably the use of unacceptable methods such as torture. The French popular view of the United States worsened at the same period, as it came to be seen as an imperialist power.<ref>Yuko Torikata,  \"Reexamining de Gaulle's peace initiative on the Vietnam War.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 31.5 (2007): 909-938.</ref><ref>Marianna P.

Small tensions reappeared intermittently. France, more strongly than any other nation, has seen the [[European Union]] as a method of counterbalancing American power, and thus works towards such ends as having the Euro challenge the preeminent position of the United States dollar in global trade and developing a European defense initiative as an alternative to [[NATO]]. Overall, the United States had much closer relations with the other large European powers, Great Britain, Germany and Italy. In the 1980s the two nations cooperated on some international matters but disagreed sharply on others, such as [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]] and the desirability of a [[German reunification|reunified Germany]]. The Reagan administration did its best efforts to prevent France and other European countries from buying natural gas from Russia, through the construction of the [[Urengoy\u2013Pomary\u2013Uzhgorod pipeline|Siberia-Europe pipeline]]. The European governments, including the French, were undeterred and the pipeline was finally built.<ref>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, eds., ''Germany unified and Europe transformed: a study in statecraft'' (Harvard UP, 1995).</ref>\n\n==Anti-Americanism==\n{{Main|Anti-Americanism#France}}\nRichard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American values and power.  He writes in 2013:\n\n{{quote|America functioned as the \"other\" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to essentialize French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, \"The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power,\" ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41-45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}\n\nOn the other hand, Kuisel identifies several strong pull effects:\n\n{{quote|American products often carried a representational or symbolic quality. They encoded messages like modernity, youthfulness, rebellion, transgression, status, and freedom ... There was the linkage with political and economic power: historically culture has followed power. Thus Europeans learned English because it is a necessary skill in a globalized environment featuring American technology, education, and business. Similarly the size and power of U.S. multinationals, like that of the global giant Coca-Cola, helped American products win market shares. Finally, it must be acknowledged, that there has been something inherently appealing about what we make and sell. Europeans liked Broadway musicals, TV shows, and fashions. We know how to make and market what others want.<ref>Kuisel, pp 43-44.</ref>}}\n\n== Middle East conflict ==\nFrance under President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] supported the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] in Iraq as a major participant under [[Operation Daguet]]. The French [[Assemblee Nationale]] even took the \"unprecedented decision\" to place all French forces in the Gulf under United States command for the duration of the war.<ref>Reynolds, David One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W.W.Norton and Co. p. 588</ref>\n\n===9-11===\n{{Further|September 11 attacks|War on terror}}\nAll the left and right wing political elements in France strongly denounced the barbaric acts of the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists in the 9/11 attack in 2001.  President [[Jacques Chirac]] \u2014later known for his frosty relationship with President [[George W. Bush]]\u2014ordered the [[French secret services]] to collaborate closely with U.S. intelligence, and created [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, a joint-intelligence service center charged with enacting the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s [[War on Terror]].  However, all the political elements rejected the idea of a full-scale war against Islamic radical terrorism. Memories of the Algerian war, and its disastrous impact on French internal affairs, as well as more distant memories of its own failed Indochina/Vietnam war, played a major role. Furthermore, France had to deal with a large Islamic population of its own, which Chirac could not afford to alienate.  As a consequence, France refused to support any American military efforts in the Middle East. Numerous works by French novelists and film makers criticized the American efforts to transform the 9/11 terrorist attacks into a justification for war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bill Marshall, ed.|title=France and the Americas, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfq5Tp0nq98C&pg=PA881|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=878\u201383|isbn=9781851094110}}</ref><ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, \"Old wine and old bottles: anti-Americanism in Britain, France and Germany.\" ''Journal of Transatlantic Studies'' 7.2 (2009): 148-162.</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\n\nIn March 2003 France, along with Germany, China, and Russia, opposed the proposed UN resolution that would have authorized a U.S. [[Invasion of Iraq (2003)|invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/11/sprj.irq.main/ |title=CNN.com \u2013 White House all but concedes U.N. defeat \u2013 Mar. 12, 2003 |accessdate=2008-12-17 | date=2003-03-11}}</ref> During the run-up to the war, French foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] emerged as a prominent critic of the American Iraq policies.

This contributed to the perception of the French as uncooperative and unsympathetic in American popular opinion at the time. This perception was quite strong and persisted despite the fact that France was and had been for some time a major ally in the campaign in Afghanistan (see for example the [[French forces in Afghanistan]]) where both nations (among others in the US-led coalition) were dedicated to the removal of the rogue Taliban, and the subsequent stabilization of Afghanistan, a recognized training ground and safe haven for terrorists intent on carrying out attacks in the Western world.\n\nAs the Iraq War progressed, relations between the two nations began to improve.
