At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 10\" /> In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near [[Wonogiri]]. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\">McDonald (1980), p. 11.</ref>\n\nPrawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto with a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquainted with Darjatmo, a ''dukun'' (\"shaman\") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee [[Muhammadiyah]] middle school in the city of [[Yogyakarta]] until 1939.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\" /><ref name=\"ELSON1\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 1\u20136 }}</ref>\n\nLike many Javanese, Suharto had [[Javanese name|only one name]].<ref name=globe>Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece \"Suharto dead at 86\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008</ref> In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called \"[[Hajji|Haji]]\" or \"el-Haj Mohammed Suharto\", but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" reflects modern Indonesian spelling, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was \"Soeharto\", but he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.<ref>{{cite book | title=Politics and the press in Indonesia | last=Romano | first=Angela Rose | page=ix | year=2003 | isbn=0-7007-1745-5}}</ref>\n\nSuharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as [[Sukarno]] in that he is believed to have had little interest in [[anti-colonialism]], or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonisers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.<ref name=\"ELSON1\"/>\n\n==Military career==\n{{Main|Early life and career of Suharto}}\n\n===World War II and Japanese occupation===\n{{See also|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies}}\n\nSuharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes.<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 12\u201313</ref> Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in June 1940 and undertook basic training in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\">McDonald (1980), pages 13</ref> Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL ''Kaderschool'' in [[Gombong]] to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in [[Cisarua]].<ref name=\"ELSON2\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page=8 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Dutch surrender to the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|invading Japanese forces]] in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of the thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\" /> In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or \"way of the warrior\", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.<ref name=\"ELSON3\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page = 9 }}</ref>\n\nSuharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at [[Wates, Kulon Progo|Wates]], south of Yogyakarta until he was admitted for training for company commander (''chudancho'') in [[Bogor]] from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in [[Surakarta]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Madiun]]. The Japanese surrender and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February [[1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar]], led by [[Supriyadi]].\n\n===Indonesian National Revolution===\n{{See also|Indonesian National Revolution}}\n\nTwo days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]] and were appointed President and Vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment under orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\">McDonald (1980), p. 14.</ref> As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. Based on his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently, a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\" /> Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around [[Magelang]] and [[Semarang]] and was subsequently appointed the head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander.<ref>McDonald (1980), p. 16.</ref> In the early years of the War, he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X's leader.<ref name=\"ELSON4\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 14\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T (\"Tiger\") Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.<ref name=\"ELSON5\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 15\u201317 }}</ref> The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the \"[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]]\") stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for the defence of the west and southwest of [[Yogyakarta]] from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet [[Musso]], chairman of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the [[Madiun Affair|communist uprising in Madiun]].<ref name=\"ELSON6\" />\n\n[[File:Lieutenant Colonel Suharto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lieutenant Colonel Suharto in 1947]]\n\nIn December 1948, the Dutch launched \"[[Operatie Kraai|Operation Crow]]\", which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital [[Yogyakarta]].

However, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Abdul Nasution]] said that Suharto took great care in preparing the \"General Offensive\" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Serangan Umum''). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 29\u201338, 42\u201344 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Revolution, Suharto married [[Siti Hartinah]] (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> The couple had six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (\"[[Titiek Suharto]]\", born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce{{clarify|date=April 2014}} to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role.

This formed the military side of the campaign to win [[western New Guinea]] from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that ''Konfrontasi'' would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, [[Ali Murtopo]], to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\n==Overthrow of Sukarno (1965)==\n{{Main|Transition to the New Order}}\n\n===Background===\n{{See also|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Sukarno, Sang Saka Melanglang Djagad, p12.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Sukarno]]]]\n\nTensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI's proposal for a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army's leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the \"[[Gilchrist Document]]\" aroused Sukarno's fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he repeatedly mentioned during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes and warned the army not to interfere.<ref>Dake, Antonie (2006). Sukarno Files. Yayasan Obor</ref>\n\nWhile Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled.  Sukarno's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno's protection. They feared the imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had three million members and was particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. The party had become the most potent political party in Indonesia.\n\n===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===\n{{Main|30 September Movement|Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966}}\n\n[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends funeral for assassinated generals, 5 October 1965.]]\n\nBefore dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281</ref> Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre.

It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of [[30 September Movement]] and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief's later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist; hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.<ref name=\"Friend-2003_p104\">Friend (2003), page 104</ref>\n\nUpon being told of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilised [[KOSTRAD]] and RPKAD (now [[Kopassus]]) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00&nbsp;pm that six generals had been kidnapped by \"counter-revolutionaries\" and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 282.</ref> Suharto issued an ultimatum to [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Air Force Base]], where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander [[Omar Dhani]] and PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the airbase on 2 October after short fighting.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281\u2013282</ref> With the failure of the poorly organised coup,<ref name=\"Ricklefs-1991_p281-282\">Ricklefs (1991), pages 281\u2013282</ref> and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals' bodies.\n\nComplicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. The army's version, and subsequently that of the [[Orde Baru|\"New Order\"]], was that the PKI was solely responsible.

For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\">Vickers (2005), page 160</ref>\n\nIn January 1966, university students under the banner of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]], begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation.

Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 288 - 290</ref>\n\nIn February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966).<ref name=\"Elson 2001 pages = 130\u2013135\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 130\u2013135 }}</ref> The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]] in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around [[Merdeka Palace]] during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to [[Bogor Palace]] (60&nbsp;km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major-General [[Basuki Rahmat]], Brigadier-General [[M Jusuf]], and Brigadier-General [[Amirmachmud]] went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see ''[[Supersemar]]'') that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\" />\n\nUsing the ''Supersemar'' letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint [[Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet|a new cabinet]] consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the [[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]] (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service.<ref name=\"Elson 2001 pages = 130\u2013135\"/>\n\nIn June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], ratifying the [[Supersemar]], and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, pages 267-270\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| pages = 267\u2013270 }}</ref> (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, page 107\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| page = 107 }}</ref> Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.25</ref>\n\nBy January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno.

After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a fundamental principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\">{{cite web |author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514025044/http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title='2 Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |access-date=2013-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe New Order also implemented the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy which enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of the Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Consolidation of power===\n{{See also|Acting presidency of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Jenderal TNI Soeharto.png|thumb|upright|Official portrait during Suharto's acting presidency]]\n[[File:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|Suharto taking the presidential oath of office, 27 March 1968]]\n\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-Communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals [[Hartono Rekso Dharsono]], [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nSuharto's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''Angkatan '66'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections (\"''Golput''\" movement), the costly construction of the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures [[Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti]], [[Adnan Buyung Nasution]], Hariman Siregar, and [[Syahrir]]), and even sending  troops to occupy the campus of ITB ([[Bandung Institute of Technology]]) from January\u2013March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing a decree on \"Normalisation of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 60\u201368</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in [[Jakarta]] during a visit by the Japanese prime minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General [[Sumitro]], deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilise the regime, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred to as the [[Malari incident|Malari Incident (''Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari'' / Disaster of 15 January)]]. However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.<ref>[http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025707/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm|date=7 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]], which criticised Suharto's use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 86\u201388</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1973 (full).jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official photo for his second term]]\n{{see also|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Papua conflict}}\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76\u201377</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto decided to take over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Groups\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, [[Golkar]] managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second-term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n{{Quote|text=\"It is not the military strength of the Communists but their fanaticism and ideology which is the principal element of their strength.

The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref> Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition. Ultimately, he held all governing power in the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSuharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicised \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the [[KORPRI|Indonesian Civil Servants Corps]] (''Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia'' or ''KORPRI'') in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the Army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were [[Sinophobia|prohibited]] from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were forced to take-up [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]; creating a systematic [[cultural genocide]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the highly successful family-planning program (''Keluarga Berentjana / KB'') to stem the high population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the [[Santa Cruz massacre]] of at least 250 [[East Timor]]ese pro-independence demonstrators during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]].]] \nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations that ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to the dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262\u2013265</ref> Notably, on March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nTo comply with [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on the integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before the end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled for July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organised militia (''[[Papuan Volunteer Corps|Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK]]'') at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963 while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite would be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178\u2013279</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n\n[[File:Suharto 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his third term (1978\u20131983)]]\n\nTo stabilise the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto's administration enlisted a group of mostly US-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by the influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments from 1967 to 1968.<ref>J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, \"The New Order and the Economy,\" Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.</ref>\n\nWith a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment through the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] / [[International Nickel Company]]. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as [[Astra Group]] and [[Salim Group]].<ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\">Robinson (2012), p. 178\u2013203</ref>\n\nFrom 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170\u2013172</ref> With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the [[1973 oil crisis]], the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (''Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun'') I to VI from 1969 to 1998.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\"/><ref name=\"Sheridan-theaustralian\">\n{{cite news| last = Sheridan| first = Greg| title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel|work=The Australian| date = 28 January 2008| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/farewell-to-jakartas-man-of-steel/story-e6frg6v6-1111115412423| accessdate =14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOutside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organisations (\"''yayasan''\") run by the military and his family members, which extracted \"donations\" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits.

Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in the [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with [[Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the left-wing populist [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford]] and Australian prime minister [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent the establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerrilla resistance caused the government to maintain a strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness, although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent killings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Indonesia's [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of [[East Timor]] during Suharto's presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths.<ref>[[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] {{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Socio-economic progress and growing corruption===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1983.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fourth term (1983\u20131988). Early into this term, Suharto was bestowed the title \"Father of Development\" by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Parliament]] due to his \"development projects\".]]\nReal socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto's regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia's poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of a series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites); consequently, Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating the education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia achieving rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialisation was mostly undertaken by [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] companies which evolved into large conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest of these conglomerates were the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his experience, he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref name=\"Deepblue.lib.umich.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40018/wp632.pdf?sequence=3|title=The Politics of Development Policy and Development Policy Reform in New Order Indonesia |publisher=Deepblue.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing a domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in the number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' program to the populace. The [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded a \"bull run\", due to a spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPOs]] and an influx of foreign funds after the deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled robust economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997, which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf|title=Bank Indonesia|publisher=Bi.go.id|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy coincided with the rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was monopolised by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] (owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\"/><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen in USD, the highest-ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion \u2013 $35 billion.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4450/26759/file/GCR_2004_press_release_FINAL.pdf|title=Plundering politicians and bribing multinationals undermine economic development, says TI|publisher=Transparency International|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The New Order in the 1980s and 1990s===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fifth term (1988\u20131993)]]\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces who adopted a hard-line approach on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The [[Tanjung Priok massacre]] saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of [[Borobudur]], led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (later leader of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by a resurgent [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating  license (''SIUPP'') which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nWestern concern over communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510\u2013511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the business dealings of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani's criticism of the Suharto family's corruption saw the president dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarise\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242\u2013264</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto and wife after hajj.jpg|256px|left|thumb|Suharto and his wife in Islamic attire after performing hajj in 1991]]\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented the dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Janet|title=Wars Within: The Story of Tempo, an Independent Magazine in Soeharto's Indonesia|date=2005|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=9793780088|pages=234\u2013235 |edition=First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto with military uniform, 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto with five-star rank on his shoulders]]\nIn the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development were becoming restless with his autocracy and the corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Post-Suharto era|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by [[Suryadi (politician)|Suryadi]], which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref>\n\n===Economic crisis and resignation===\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his resignation speech at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the [[Indonesian rupiah]] to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7%, leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country.<ref name=\"CountryBrief\">{{cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html}}</ref> Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits and set-up the [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised an interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998, which further worsened the contraction of the economy.\n\nIn December 1997, Suharto did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit for the first time, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 313.</ref> However, his attempts to re-instil confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.<ref>Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v.</ref>\n\n[[File:President Suharto, 1998.png|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his seventh term (1998)]]\nThe economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. [[Golkar]] won the rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|1997 election]], and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He nominated his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[B. J.

[[Indonesian riots of May 1998|Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities]] over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Commander of Army Strategic Command (Indonesia)|Army Strategic Commander]] Lt. Gen. [[Prabowo Subianto]], and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanded Suharto's resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of [[DPR/MPR Building|the parliament building]]. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref><ref>E.

The High Court reversed the [[judgment (law)|judgement]] of an [[appellate court]] and [[Central Jakarta]] [[district court]] (made in 2000 and 2001).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSuharto was placed highest on [[Transparency International]]'s list of corrupt leaders with alleged misappropriation of between US$15\u201335 billion during his 32-year presidency.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\"/><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\"/>\n\nOn 29 May 2000, Suharto was placed under [[house arrest]] when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of several foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. However, in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002, but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110&nbsp;m (\u00a355&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7315976.stm |title=Suharto charity told to pay $110&nbsp;m| publisher=BBC News | date=27 March 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Suharto's son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]] was sentenced to 15 years' jail for ordering the killing of a judge (who had previously convicted him of corruption), illegal weapons possession and fleeing justice.

He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the \"judicial mafia\" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on 30 November 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nOn 9 July 2007, Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against former President Suharto, to recover state funds ($440&nbsp;m or \u00a3219&nbsp;m, which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund, and a further $1.1 billion in damages).<ref name=\"BBC_9July\">{{cite news | title= Civil suit filed against Suharto | date= 9 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6283322.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nAfter resigning from the presidency, Suharto was hospitalised repeatedly for [[Cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute him as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial.  Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial.

At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 10\" /> In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near [[Wonogiri]]. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\">McDonald (1980), p. 11.</ref>\n\nPrawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto with a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquainted with Darjatmo, a ''dukun'' (\"shaman\") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee [[Muhammadiyah]] middle school in the city of [[Yogyakarta]] until 1939.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\" /><ref name=\"ELSON1\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 1\u20136 }}</ref>\n\nLike many Javanese, Suharto had [[Javanese name|only one name]].<ref name=globe>Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece \"Suharto dead at 86\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008</ref> In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called \"[[Hajji|Haji]]\" or \"el-Haj Mohammed Suharto\", but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" reflects modern Indonesian spelling, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was \"Soeharto\", but he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.<ref>{{cite book | title=Politics and the press in Indonesia | last=Romano | first=Angela Rose | page=ix | year=2003 | isbn=0-7007-1745-5}}</ref>\n\nSuharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as [[Sukarno]] in that he is believed to have had little interest in [[anti-colonialism]], or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonisers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.<ref name=\"ELSON1\"/>\n\n==Military career==\n{{Main|Early life and career of Suharto}}\n\n===World War II and Japanese occupation===\n{{See also|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies}}\n\nSuharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes.<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 12\u201313</ref> Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in June 1940 and undertook basic training in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\">McDonald (1980), pages 13</ref> Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL ''Kaderschool'' in [[Gombong]] to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in [[Cisarua]].<ref name=\"ELSON2\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page=8 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Dutch surrender to the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|invading Japanese forces]] in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of the thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\" /> In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or \"way of the warrior\", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.<ref name=\"ELSON3\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page = 9 }}</ref>\n\nSuharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at [[Wates, Kulon Progo|Wates]], south of Yogyakarta until he was admitted for training for company commander (''chudancho'') in [[Bogor]] from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in [[Surakarta]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Madiun]]. The Japanese surrender and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February [[1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar]], led by [[Supriyadi]].\n\n===Indonesian National Revolution===\n{{See also|Indonesian National Revolution}}\n\nTwo days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]] and were appointed President and Vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment under orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\">McDonald (1980), p. 14.</ref> As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. Based on his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently, a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\" /> Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around [[Magelang]] and [[Semarang]] and was subsequently appointed the head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander.<ref>McDonald (1980), p. 16.</ref> In the early years of the War, he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X's leader.<ref name=\"ELSON4\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 14\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T (\"Tiger\") Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.<ref name=\"ELSON5\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 15\u201317 }}</ref> The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the \"[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]]\") stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for the defence of the west and southwest of [[Yogyakarta]] from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet [[Musso]], chairman of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the [[Madiun Affair|communist uprising in Madiun]].<ref name=\"ELSON6\" />\n\n[[File:Lieutenant Colonel Suharto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lieutenant Colonel Suharto in 1947]]\n\nIn December 1948, the Dutch launched \"[[Operatie Kraai|Operation Crow]]\", which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital [[Yogyakarta]].

However, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Abdul Nasution]] said that Suharto took great care in preparing the \"General Offensive\" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Serangan Umum''). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 29\u201338, 42\u201344 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Revolution, Suharto married [[Siti Hartinah]] (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> The couple had six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (\"[[Titiek Suharto]]\", born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964).

This formed the military side of the campaign to win [[western New Guinea]] from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that ''Konfrontasi'' would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, [[Ali Murtopo]], to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\n==Overthrow of Sukarno (1965)==\n{{Main|Transition to the New Order}}\n\n===Background===\n{{See also|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Sukarno, Sang Saka Melanglang Djagad, p12.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Sukarno]]]]\n\nTensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI's proposal for a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army's leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the \"[[Gilchrist Document]]\" aroused Sukarno's fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he repeatedly mentioned during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes and warned the army not to interfere.<ref>Dake, Antonie (2006). Sukarno Files. Yayasan Obor</ref>\n\nWhile Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled.  Sukarno's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno's protection. They feared the imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had three million members and was particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. The party had become the most potent political party in Indonesia.\n\n===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===\n{{Main|30 September Movement|Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966}}\n\n[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends funeral for assassinated generals, 5 October 1965.]]\n\nBefore dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281</ref> Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre.

It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of [[30 September Movement]] and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief's later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist; hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.<ref name=\"Friend-2003_p104\">Friend (2003), page 104</ref>\n\nUpon being told of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilised [[KOSTRAD]] and RPKAD (now [[Kopassus]]) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00&nbsp;pm that six generals had been kidnapped by \"counter-revolutionaries\" and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 282.</ref> Suharto issued an ultimatum to [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Air Force Base]], where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander [[Omar Dhani]] and PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the airbase on 2 October after short fighting.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281\u2013282</ref> With the failure of the poorly organised coup,<ref name=\"Ricklefs-1991_p281-282\">Ricklefs (1991), pages 281\u2013282</ref> and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October).

The army's version, and subsequently that of the [[Orde Baru|\"New Order\"]], was that the PKI was solely responsible.

For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\">Vickers (2005), page 160</ref>\n\nIn January 1966, university students under the banner of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]], begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation.

On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around [[Merdeka Palace]] during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to [[Bogor Palace]] (60&nbsp;km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major-General [[Basuki Rahmat]], Brigadier-General [[M Jusuf]], and Brigadier-General [[Amirmachmud]] went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see ''[[Supersemar]]'') that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\" />\n\nUsing the ''Supersemar'' letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint [[Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet|a new cabinet]] consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the [[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]] (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service.<ref name=\"Elson 2001 pages = 130\u2013135\"/>\n\nIn June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], ratifying the [[Supersemar]], and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, pages 267-270\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| pages = 267\u2013270 }}</ref> (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, page 107\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| page = 107 }}</ref> Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.25</ref>\n\nBy January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno.

After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a fundamental principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\">{{cite web |author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514025044/http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title='2 Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |access-date=2013-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe New Order also implemented the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy which enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of the Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Consolidation of power===\n{{See also|Acting presidency of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Jenderal TNI Soeharto.png|thumb|upright|Official portrait during Suharto's acting presidency]]\n[[File:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|Suharto taking the presidential oath of office, 27 March 1968]]\n\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-Communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals [[Hartono Rekso Dharsono]], [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nSuharto's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''Angkatan '66'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections (\"''Golput''\" movement), the costly construction of the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures [[Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti]], [[Adnan Buyung Nasution]], Hariman Siregar, and [[Syahrir]]), and even sending  troops to occupy the campus of ITB ([[Bandung Institute of Technology]]) from January\u2013March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing a decree on \"Normalisation of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 60\u201368</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in [[Jakarta]] during a visit by the Japanese prime minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General [[Sumitro]], deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilise the regime, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred to as the [[Malari incident|Malari Incident (''Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari'' / Disaster of 15 January)]]. However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.<ref>[http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025707/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm|date=7 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]], which criticised Suharto's use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 86\u201388</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1973 (full).jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official photo for his second term]]\n{{see also|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Papua conflict}}\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76\u201377</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto decided to take over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Groups\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, [[Golkar]] managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second-term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n{{Quote|text=\"It is not the military strength of the Communists but their fanaticism and ideology which is the principal element of their strength.

The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref> Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition. Ultimately, he held all governing power in the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSuharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicised \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the [[KORPRI|Indonesian Civil Servants Corps]] (''Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia'' or ''KORPRI'') in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the Army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were [[Sinophobia|prohibited]] from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were forced to take-up [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]; creating a systematic [[cultural genocide]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the highly successful family-planning program (''Keluarga Berentjana / KB'') to stem the high population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the [[Santa Cruz massacre]] of at least 250 [[East Timor]]ese pro-independence demonstrators during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]].]] \nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations that ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to the dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262\u2013265</ref> Notably, on March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nTo comply with [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on the integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before the end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled for July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organised militia (''[[Papuan Volunteer Corps|Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK]]'') at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963 while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite would be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178\u2013279</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n\n[[File:Suharto 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his third term (1978\u20131983)]]\n\nTo stabilise the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto's administration enlisted a group of mostly US-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by the influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments from 1967 to 1968.<ref>J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, \"The New Order and the Economy,\" Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.</ref>\n\nWith a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment through the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] / [[International Nickel Company]]. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as [[Astra Group]] and [[Salim Group]].<ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\">Robinson (2012), p. 178\u2013203</ref>\n\nFrom 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170\u2013172</ref> With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the [[1973 oil crisis]], the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (''Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun'') I to VI from 1969 to 1998.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\"/><ref name=\"Sheridan-theaustralian\">\n{{cite news| last = Sheridan| first = Greg| title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel|work=The Australian| date = 28 January 2008| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/farewell-to-jakartas-man-of-steel/story-e6frg6v6-1111115412423| accessdate =14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOutside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organisations (\"''yayasan''\") run by the military and his family members, which extracted \"donations\" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits.

Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in the [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with [[Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the left-wing populist [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford]] and Australian prime minister [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent the establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerrilla resistance caused the government to maintain a strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness, although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent killings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Indonesia's [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of [[East Timor]] during Suharto's presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths.<ref>[[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] {{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Socio-economic progress and growing corruption===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1983.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fourth term (1983\u20131988). Early into this term, Suharto was bestowed the title \"Father of Development\" by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Parliament]] due to his \"development projects\".]]\nReal socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto's regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia's poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of a series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites); consequently, Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating the education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia achieving rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialisation was mostly undertaken by [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] companies which evolved into large conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest of these conglomerates were the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his experience, he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref name=\"Deepblue.lib.umich.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40018/wp632.pdf?sequence=3|title=The Politics of Development Policy and Development Policy Reform in New Order Indonesia |publisher=Deepblue.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing a domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in the number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' program to the populace. The [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded a \"bull run\", due to a spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPOs]] and an influx of foreign funds after the deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled robust economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997, which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf|title=Bank Indonesia|publisher=Bi.go.id|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy coincided with the rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was monopolised by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] (owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\"/><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen in USD, the highest-ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion \u2013 $35 billion.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4450/26759/file/GCR_2004_press_release_FINAL.pdf|title=Plundering politicians and bribing multinationals undermine economic development, says TI|publisher=Transparency International|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The New Order in the 1980s and 1990s===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fifth term (1988\u20131993)]]\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces who adopted a hard-line approach on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The [[Tanjung Priok massacre]] saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of [[Borobudur]], led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (later leader of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by a resurgent [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating  license (''SIUPP'') which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nWestern concern over communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510\u2013511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the business dealings of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani's criticism of the Suharto family's corruption saw the president dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarise\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242\u2013264</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto and wife after hajj.jpg|256px|left|thumb|Suharto and his wife in Islamic attire after performing hajj in 1991]]\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented the dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Janet|title=Wars Within: The Story of Tempo, an Independent Magazine in Soeharto's Indonesia|date=2005|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=9793780088|pages=234\u2013235 |edition=First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto with military uniform, 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto with five-star rank on his shoulders]]\nIn the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development were becoming restless with his autocracy and the corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Post-Suharto era|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by [[Suryadi (politician)|Suryadi]], which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref>\n\n===Economic crisis and resignation===\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his resignation speech at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the [[Indonesian rupiah]] to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7%, leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country.<ref name=\"CountryBrief\">{{cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html}}</ref> Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits and set-up the [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised an interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998, which further worsened the contraction of the economy.\n\nIn December 1997, Suharto did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit for the first time, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 313.</ref> However, his attempts to re-instil confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.<ref>Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v.</ref>\n\n[[File:President Suharto, 1998.png|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his seventh term (1998)]]\nThe economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. [[Golkar]] won the rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|1997 election]], and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He nominated his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[B. J.

[[Indonesian riots of May 1998|Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities]] over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Commander of Army Strategic Command (Indonesia)|Army Strategic Commander]] Lt. Gen. [[Prabowo Subianto]], and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanded Suharto's resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of [[DPR/MPR Building|the parliament building]]. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref><ref>E.

The High Court reversed the [[judgment (law)|judgement]] of an [[appellate court]] and [[Central Jakarta]] [[district court]] (made in 2000 and 2001).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSuharto was placed highest on [[Transparency International]]'s list of corrupt leaders with alleged misappropriation of between US$15\u201335 billion during his 32-year presidency.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\"/><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\"/>\n\nOn 29 May 2000, Suharto was placed under [[house arrest]] when Indonesian authorities began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, it was announced that he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to one of several foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. However, in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002, but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110&nbsp;m (\u00a355&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7315976.stm |title=Suharto charity told to pay $110&nbsp;m| publisher=BBC News | date=27 March 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Suharto's son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]] was sentenced to 15 years' jail for ordering the killing of a judge (who had previously convicted him of corruption), illegal weapons possession and fleeing justice.

He was sentenced to four years in jail. He later won a reduction of his sentence to two years, initiating a probe by the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission into the alleged scandal of the \"judicial mafia\" which uncovered offers of $600,000 to various judges. Probosutedjo confessed to the scheme in October 2005, leading to the arrest of his lawyers. His full four-year term was reinstated. After a brief standoff at a hospital, in which he was reportedly protected by a group of police officers, he was arrested on 30 November 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nOn 9 July 2007, Indonesian prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against former President Suharto, to recover state funds ($440&nbsp;m or \u00a3219&nbsp;m, which allegedly disappeared from a scholarship fund, and a further $1.1 billion in damages).<ref name=\"BBC_9July\">{{cite news | title= Civil suit filed against Suharto | date= 9 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6283322.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nAfter resigning from the presidency, Suharto was hospitalised repeatedly for [[Cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], heart, and intestinal problems. His declining health hindered attempts to prosecute him as his lawyers successfully claimed that his condition rendered him unfit for trial.  Moreover, there was little support within Indonesia for any attempts to prosecute him. In 2006, Attorney General Abdurrahman announced that a team of twenty doctors would be asked to evaluate Suharto's health and fitness for trial.

Television Productions UK]] (formerly [[Shed Media]] Group), is an independent television production company that produces event specials and drama, factual entertainment, science and history programmes for broadcast by networks in both the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nIn January 2009, Wall to Wall's first feature film ''[[Man on Wire]]'' won a [[BAFTA]] award for Outstanding British Film and followed this success with an [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary Feature. Previously, the company had won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2000 for ''The 1900 House''.<ref>[[The 1900 House|60th Annual Peabody Awards]], May 2001.</ref>\n\nWall to Wall joined the [[Shed Media]] Group in November 2007.\n\nThe company's name derives from negative references made in the mid-1980s, by then [[Director-General of the BBC|BBC Director-General]] [[Alasdair Milne]] and in the title of a book by ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist Chris Dunkley, to \"wall-to-wall ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''\" as a possible aftereffect of the coming deregulation of UK broadcasting.  Future [[BBC Two|BBC2]] controller [[Jane Root]], among the company's founders, considered this a negative, puritanical and conservative view of the medium's possibilities (ref. ''[[NME]]'', 17 May 1986) and the name \"Wall to Wall Television\" was adopted as a conscious celebration of the medium, which its founders considered the [[The Establishment|\"establishment\"]] of the time to be frightened of.\n\n==Programming==\n===Current productions===\n*''[[Long Lost Family (UK TV series)|Long Lost Family]]'': six series for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV-]] total 43 episodes with more in production.\n*[[Back in Time for...|''Back in Time For''...]]: five series for [[BBC Two]] \u2013 total 22 episodes, with more in production.\n*''[[Child Genius (UK TV series)|Child Genius]]'': four series plus a documentary, Celebrity Special and a \"Five Years On\" special for [[Channel 4]] \u2013 total 18 episodes with more in production. \n*[[Who Do You Think You Are?

Television Productions UK]] (formerly [[Shed Media]] Group), is an independent television production company that produces event specials and drama, factual entertainment, science and history programmes for broadcast by networks in both the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nIn January 2009, Wall to Wall's first feature film ''[[Man on Wire]]'' won a [[BAFTA]] award for Outstanding British Film and followed this success with an [[Academy Award]] for Best Documentary Feature. Previously, the company had won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2000 for ''The 1900 House''.<ref>[[The 1900 House|60th Annual Peabody Awards]], May 2001.</ref>\n\nWall to Wall joined the [[Shed Media]] Group in November 2007.\n\nThe company's name derives from negative references made in the mid-1980s, by then [[Director-General of the BBC|BBC Director-General]] [[Alasdair Milne]] and in the title of a book by ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist Chris Dunkley, to \"wall-to-wall ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''\" as a possible aftereffect of the coming deregulation of UK broadcasting.  Future [[BBC Two|BBC2]] controller [[Jane Root]], among the company's founders, considered this a negative, puritanical and conservative view of the medium's possibilities (ref. ''[[NME]]'', 17 May 1986) and the name \"Wall to Wall Television\" was adopted as a conscious celebration of the medium, which its founders considered the [[The Establishment|\"establishment\"]] of the time to be frightened of.\n\n==Programming==\n===Current productions===\n*''[[Long Lost Family (UK TV series)|Long Lost Family]]'': six series for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV-]] total 43 episodes with more in production.\n*[[Back in Time for...|''Back in Time For''...]]: five series for [[BBC Two]] \u2013 total 22 episodes, with more in production.\n*''[[Child Genius (UK TV series)|Child Genius]]'': four series plus a documentary, Celebrity Special and a \"Five Years On\" special for [[Channel 4]] \u2013 total 18 episodes with more in production. \n*[[Who Do You Think You Are?

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations. The [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]] tram services to the [[Glattal]] area to the north of the city interwork with the city tram services and are also operated by the VBZ, although in this case it does so as a sub-contractor to the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] (VBG).

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles. The ''Karpfen'' last ran in regular service in 2006, and the ''Mirage'' in 2010.

Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten. This is connected to the tram network, and also has a rail connection to the [[Swiss Federal Railway]] system, allowing the delivery of infrastructure items and vehicles by rail.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=zws>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/werkstatt.html | title = Werkstatt | language = German | trans-title = Workshop | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above depots and workshops, two other former tram depots, at Burgweis and Wartau, are also still connected to the tram network. Burgweis depot now houses the [[Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich]] main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.<ref name=gpw/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Tram fleet===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles. The heritage fleet sees occasional use on special services.<ref name=vbzfafveh>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/vehicles.html | title = VBZ - Portrait - Facts & figures - Vehicles | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007014744/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/vehicles.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref><ref name=vbzfafser>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/service.html | title = VBZ - Portrait - Facts & figures - Service | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-04}}</ref>\n\nThe tram fleet comprises the following vehicles:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;\"\n!Image\n!Numbers\n!Type\n![[Swiss locomotive and railcar classification|Notation]]\n!Capacity<br>Sit/Stand\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2034 Bellevue.jpg|200px|Z\u00fcrich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2034 Bellevue]]\n|2001-2098\n|Tram&nbsp;2000\n|Be 4/6\n|50/54\n|The two section articulated variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] for Z\u00fcrich, of which 98 vehicles were delivered in two stages from 1976 to 1978, and from 1985 to 1987.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year. As Z\u00fcrich has an extensive tram network serving most neighbourhoods, and many suitable sidings not used by regular services, it was decided to use the tram network.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year. As Z\u00fcrich has an extensive tram network serving most neighbourhoods, and many suitable sidings not used by regular services, it was decided to use the tram network.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

the overthrow of [[King Zahir Shah]] by his distant cousin [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] in a bloodless [[1973 Afghan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Daoud Khan had served as prime minister since 1953 and promoted economic modernization, [[emancipation]] of women, and [[Pashtun nationalism]]. This was threatening to neighboring Pakistan, faced with its own restive [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] population. In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan [[Islamist]] leaders such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|title=Mohammad Daud Khan|date=2000|website=Afghanland.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817040633/http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref> The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The [[Soviet Union]], sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\nThe entry of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the United States, Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]] to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Besides Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen.

The report emphasizes the rise of \"complex attacks\", a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, described by the New York Times as the hallmark of the war in 2018. These attacks are referred to as the Taliban's ferocious response to US President Trump's new strategy of war (an increased pace of aerial bombardments targeting Taliban and Islamic State Militants), giving the message that the Taliban can strike at will, even in the capital city, Kabul. The U.N. report included a statement showing the Taliban's position, the Taliban blamed the U.S and its allies for fighting the war in Afghanistan, and it denied targeting civilians. The New York Times quoted Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired general and military analyst based in Kabul, saying that the UN report proved the failure of peace talks, as the Taliban and the US government are both determined for victory rather than negotiating a settlement. He said \"More airstrikes mean more suicide attacks,\" proving the intensification of the war by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAfghanistan&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection|title=More Afghan Civilians Being Deliberately Targeted, U.N.

In the mid-1970s, Pakistani Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] began to encourage Afghan [[Islamist]] leaders such as [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] to fight against the regime. In 1978, Daoud Khan was killed in [[Saur Revolution|a coup by Afghan's Communist Party]], his former partner in government, known as the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|title=Mohammad Daud Khan|date=2000|website=Afghanland.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817040633/http://www.afghanland.com/history/biography/daoud.html|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=|access-date=11 March 2018}}</ref> The PDPA pushed for a socialist transformation by abolishing arranged marriages, promoting mass literacy and reforming land ownership. This undermined the traditional tribal order and provoked opposition across rural areas. The PDPA's crackdown was met with open rebellion, including [[Ismail Khan]]'s [[1979 Herat Uprising|Herat Uprising]]. The PDPA was beset by internal leadership differences and was weakened by an internal coup on 11 September 1979 when [[Hafizullah Amin]] ousted [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]. The [[Soviet Union]], sensing PDPA weakness, [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened militarily three months later]], [[Operation Storm-333|to depose Amin]] and install [[Parcham|another PDA faction]] led by [[Babrak Karmal]].\n\nThe entry of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in December 1979 prompted its [[Cold War]] rivals, the United States, Pakistan, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[China]] to support rebels fighting against the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In contrast to the secular and socialist government, which controlled the cities, religiously motivated [[mujahideen]] held sway in much of the countryside. Besides Rabbani, Hekmatyar, and Khan, other mujahideen commanders included [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]]. The [[CIA]] worked closely with Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence]] to funnel foreign support for the mujahideen. The war also attracted Arab volunteers, known as \"[[Afghan Arabs]]\", including [[Osama bin Laden]].\n\nAfter the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawal of the Soviet military from Afghanistan]] in May 1989, the PDPA regime under [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] held on until 1992, when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] deprived the regime of aid, and the defection of Uzbek general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] cleared the approach to [[Kabul]]. With the political stage cleared of socialists, the warlords, some of them Islamist, vied for power. By then, Bin Laden had left the country and the United States' interest in Afghanistan also diminished.\n\n===Warlord rule (1992\u20131996)===\n{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1992\u201396)}}\n[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] (right) with Pashtun anti-Taliban leader and later Vice-President of the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]]]\n\nIn 1992, Rabbani officially became president of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], but had to battle other warlords for control of Kabul.

The report emphasizes the rise of \"complex attacks\", a type of suicide assault that is becoming more deadly, described by the New York Times as the hallmark of the war in 2018. These attacks are referred to as the Taliban's ferocious response to US President Trump's new strategy of war (an increased pace of aerial bombardments targeting Taliban and Islamic State Militants), giving the message that the Taliban can strike at will, even in the capital city, Kabul. The U.N. report included a statement showing the Taliban's position, the Taliban blamed the U.S and its allies for fighting the war in Afghanistan, and it denied targeting civilians. The New York Times quoted Atiqullah Amarkhel, a retired general and military analyst based in Kabul, saying that the UN report proved the failure of peace talks, as the Taliban and the US government are both determined for victory rather than negotiating a settlement. He said \"More airstrikes mean more suicide attacks,\" proving the intensification of the war by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/world/asia/afghanistan-civilian-casualties.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAfghanistan&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection|title=More Afghan Civilians Being Deliberately Targeted, U.N.

By the end of March 1975, the study revealed a plan to build three inline runways, three international terminal buildings, three domestic buildings, and one building for [[Hajj]] flights. Three stores for the domestic terminals would be built between 1975 and 1981 at a cost of [[US$]]465 million and one domestic terminal including an apron from 1982\u20131985 at a cost of US$126 million.

The airport terminal took the plan of spanning fan, with the main entrances of terminals connected to a series of waiting and boarding pavilions via corridors. These waiting and boarding pavilions are connected to the airplanes through [[jet bridge|boarding bridges]]. Terminal 1 is on the southern side of the airport, while Terminal 2 and 3 are on the north side.\n\nThe airport concept is described as \"garden within the airport\" or \"airport in the garden\", as tropical decorative and flower plants fill the spaces between corridors, waiting and boarding pavilions. The boarding pavilions demonstrate local [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], particularly the roof, in the [[Java]]nese stepped-roof ''[[pendopo]]'' and ''[[joglo]]'' style. The interior design displays the diversity of Indonesian art and culture, with ethnic decorative elements taken from wooden carvings of Java, Bali, Sumatra, Dayak, [[Toraja]] to Papua. Another example is the railings of stairs, doors, and gates, which show the [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] (giant head and mythical fish-elephant creature) theme typical in [[Candi of Indonesia#Kala-Makara|ancient Indonesian temples]] such as [[Borobudur]].

The cost rose because of using a decentralized system. The centralized system was seen as a more suitable option. The team, however, chose the latter, similar to [[Orly Airport]], [[Lyon Satolas Airport|Lyon Satolas]], [[Hannover Airport]] and [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City Airport]] due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the building project tender was won by the French Aeroport de Paris. 6 months later, the final design was agreed on by the Indonesian government and Aeroport de Paris with a fixed cost of about 22,323,203 French francs and Rp. 177,156,000 equivalent to 2,100,000 francs. The work was scheduled to take 18 months. The government-appointed PT. Konavi as the local partner. The plan included 2 runways with taxiways, one access road in the east and one in the west (closed to public use) for airport services, 3 terminals capable of accommodating 3 million passengers per year, and 1 module for international flights and 2 for domestic. \"An airport inside a garden\" was chosen as the design idea.\n\nOn 20 May 1980, a four-year contract was signed.

The feasibility study started on 20 February 1974, with a total cost of 1 million [[Canadian dollars]]. The one-year project proceeded with an Indonesian partner represented by PT Konavi. By the end of March 1975, the study revealed a plan to build three inline runways, three international terminal buildings, three domestic buildings, and one building for [[Hajj]] flights. Three stores for the domestic terminals would be built between 1975 and 1981 at a cost of [[US$]]465 million and one domestic terminal including an apron from 1982\u20131985 at a cost of US$126 million.

There are two parallel runways, on the north and south side. The airport terminal took the plan of spanning fan, with the main entrances of terminals connected to a series of waiting and boarding pavilions via corridors. These waiting and boarding pavilions are connected to the airplanes through [[jet bridge|boarding bridges]]. Terminal 1 is on the southern side of the airport, while Terminal 2 and 3 are on the north side.\n\nThe airport concept is described as \"garden within the airport\" or \"airport in the garden\", as tropical decorative and flower plants fill the spaces between corridors, waiting and boarding pavilions. The boarding pavilions demonstrate local [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], particularly the roof, in the [[Java]]nese stepped-roof ''[[pendopo]]'' and ''[[joglo]]'' style. The interior design displays the diversity of Indonesian art and culture, with ethnic decorative elements taken from wooden carvings of Java, Bali, Sumatra, Dayak, [[Toraja]] to Papua. Another example is the railings of stairs, doors, and gates, which show the [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] (giant head and mythical fish-elephant creature) theme typical in [[Candi of Indonesia#Kala-Makara|ancient Indonesian temples]] such as [[Borobudur]].

The cost rose because of using a decentralized system. The centralized system was seen as a more suitable option. The team, however, chose the latter, similar to [[Orly Airport]], [[Lyon Satolas Airport|Lyon Satolas]], [[Hannover Airport]] and [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City Airport]] due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the building project tender was won by the French Aeroport de Paris. 6 months later, the final design was agreed on by the Indonesian government and Aeroport de Paris with a fixed cost of about 22,323,203 French francs and Rp. 177,156,000 equivalent to 2,100,000 francs. The work was scheduled to take 18 months. The government-appointed PT. Konavi as the local partner. The plan included 2 runways with taxiways, one access road in the east and one in the west (closed to public use) for airport services, 3 terminals capable of accommodating 3 million passengers per year, and 1 module for international flights and 2 for domestic. \"An airport inside a garden\" was chosen as the design idea.\n\nOn 20 May 1980, a four-year contract was signed. Sainraptet Brice, SAE, Colas together with PT. Waskita Karya were chosen to be the developers. Ir.

The cost structure was: Rp140,450,513,000 from the state budget, 1,223,457 francs donated by France and US$15,898,251 from the United States. The airport structure was completed exactly four years later.

According to the press release, ''Hoard Inaugural\u2019s works function on a vector divorced from the model of the standardized, refined index or \u2018complete\u2019 artwork. They are works and collections that tarry with the hoard and sometimes succumb. The works suggest the possibility of endless conjugation and the impossibility of final categorization, they contain evidence of digging, of obsession, and in some cases unresolvable moral quandaries.'' In 2015, Benzel organized ''Sonatine Bureaucratique'' at Los Angeles Contemporary Archive. According to the press release, ''The show features found and archived material from seemingly disparate spheres presented in conjunction to illuminate how the works of certain conceptual artists ultimately prefigured contemporary systems that have become thoroughly aligned with an administration of social control.

According to the press release, ''Hoard Inaugural\u2019s works function on a vector divorced from the model of the standardized, refined index or \u2018complete\u2019 artwork. They are works and collections that tarry with the hoard and sometimes succumb. The works suggest the possibility of endless conjugation and the impossibility of final categorization, they contain evidence of digging, of obsession, and in some cases unresolvable moral quandaries.'' In 2015, Benzel organized ''Sonatine Bureaucratique'' at Los Angeles Contemporary Archive. According to the press release, ''The show features found and archived material from seemingly disparate spheres presented in conjunction to illuminate how the works of certain conceptual artists ultimately prefigured contemporary systems that have become thoroughly aligned with an administration of social control.

The show revolves around the titular characters: the cats Oggy, Jack and the cockroaches Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee. When the show started airing in 1998, it was successful in France and was eventually broadcast worldwide.\n\n==Synopsis==\nOggy, an [[anthropomorphic]] cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating, but is continuously pestered by three roaches, Joey, Dee Dee and Marky (all named after members of the [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]]). The Cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. There are two additional main characters: Oggy's cousin Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the Cockroaches; and Bob, a short-tempered bulldog who is Oggy's neighbor.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n{{section#h|Series overview|page=List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework \u2014 when not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of [[love\u2013hate relationship]] with them, having lived with them for a long time. In the episode \"The Ghost Hunter\", Oggy kills the cockroaches but is terrorized by the spirits. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode \"Priceless Roaches\" and \"So Lonely\") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. Oggy's house appears bigger on the inside, mainly featured in the roller coaster-like staircase scenes. According to executive producer [[Marc du Pontavice]] and [[France Info]], the character of Oggy was named after punk rock musician [[Iggy Pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commeaucinema.com/interviews/oggy-et-les-cafards-le-film-animation-comedie,289933|title=Interview with Marc du Pontavice|accessdate=14 January 2014|language=French}}</ref> and the rock album [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/cartoon-story/2014-ete/oggy-et-les-cafards-08-06-2014-09-55|title=Article on Oggy and the Cockroaches|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=10 August 2014|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/09/18/1954159-oggy-superstar-made-in-france.html|title=La D\u00e9p\u00eache interview|accessdate=19 September 2014|language=French}}</ref> In early episodes, Oggy, like his   [[Tom Cat|Tom and Jerry counterpart]] was the main punching bag in the series. However, in more recent episodes, Oggy has been portrayed as heroic, often triumphing over the cockroaches despite the beatings he takes from them and Bob. Notable other accomplishments include winning the Formula 1, placing first in a marathon, and ultimately winning over his girlfriend Olivia.\n*The Cockroaches are three brothers who antagonize other characters, mainly Oggy and Jack. The cockroaches love pranking them so much, that if the cats were to leave, they would miss them (as seen in the episode \"Moving Out\"). It is also implied that the roaches are named after members of the rock band, [[The Ramones]].\n** Joey (born 15 June 1991)<ref>{{cite episode|season=4|title=Let's Party, Guys!|series=Oggy and the Cockroaches|number=201|credits=Olivier Jean-Marie (director, writer), Fred Mintoff (storyboard)|date=15 July 2012|network=Gulli}}</ref> is a purple-pink body, purple-blue head roach with a [[Heterochromia iridum|pink right eye (originally red) and yellow left eye]], and the oldest brother. Even though he's the smallest roach in the group, most of the time he's the most intelligent, always being the brain in the plans, but is sometimes forced to go solo, because his brothers often think that his plans are stupid. He loves money, but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He is named after lead singer [[Joey Ramone]].\n** Marky is a suave heartbreaking, silvery-grey body, green head roach with pink eyes (originally red, but returned in the ending of the episode \"Teleportation\" where he is stuck in the ice cubes); he is the tallest and middle brother of the three roaches and often doesn't really care about what the two others are doing. While he originally used to love causing mischief just like his brothers, he has grown to be more laid-back in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and causing general mayhem like he has always done. His hobbies are dating puppets and reading books. He also has bad breath, as revealed in the season 1 and season 6 episode \"It's A Small World\". He is named after drummer [[Marky Ramone]].\n** Dee Dee is the ever-hungry cockroach and youngest of the three. He has a blue body, orange head and green eyes. His appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as [[hyena]]s in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect. Other instances include the fish on the wallpaper \"Oggy's Clone\",\" and a [[clownfish]] in \"Scuba Diving\"). He is known to like opera. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling, the juice they produce is toxic and melt objects, as shown in \"Caught in a Trap\". He is named after bassist [[Dee Dee Ramone]]\n* Jack is Oggy's cousin, He is a cat who has an olive green body, yellow eyes, pale Salmon pink tummy and white feet, in the show. He is like the complete opposite of Oggy, as he is more short-tempered, violent and arrogant than him \u2013 a perfect target for the roaches to annoy. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, most of the time resulting in them backfiring, making him less lucky than Oggy in most situations. He is also very interested in chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it). Jack often sleeps over at Oggy's house. At times, he bullies Oggy. Jack seems to be the strongest character in the show. He likes to show off, challenge the roaches and date girls \u2013 mainly Oggy's sister Monica. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches' pranks always make him stop short. In one episode, they seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. Jack also has a morbid fear of heights, as shown in several episodes like the season 4 episode \"The Lighthouse Keeper\". However, in the season 1 episode \"The Rise & The Fall\" Oggy has a fear of heights instead of Jack.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Bob is a fierce brown [[bulldog]] and Oggy's neighbour. He has severe anger management issues.  A running gag in the show has Oggy or Jack doing something that accidentally crushes Bob or shaves his fur or destroys his house, with Bob then pummeling Oggy or Jack off-screen. He does not always pummel Oggy, as seen in a few episodes. He has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in ''Olivia'' and ''Back to the Past!''. He is known to like boxing.\n* Olivia is a white cat (also mainly wearing a yellow bow on her head), who is Oggy's new neighbour and new love interest introduced in season 4. She loves nature, even Oggy's main enemies, the cockroaches, leading to Oggy acting nice to them every time she's around. She is aware of their mischief, so she does stop them when they are around by using some aggressive methods, from her anger to even an painful-looking fly swatter. She always breaks down when someone hurts any part of nature. She also cares a lot about her looks, as seen in the episode \"Olivia's Pimple\", where when she saw a pimple on her face, she refused to leave her house. In the season 4 finale episode \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy get married after a trip to [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], [[Italy]].\n* Oggy's grandma is a very rarely seen character only appearing in three episodes; \"Granny's Day\" in season 1 and \"Oggy's Grandma\" in season 3, where she appears to be very strict with Oggy's mannerisms and in \"Deep Trouble\" beside Monica, as they support Oggy and Jack. In the episodes Granny's Day and Oggy's Grandma, she attacks the cockroaches, and is actually attacked by them in Oggy's Grandma, one time being her head flattened by the lid of Oggy's toilet. She also gets frequent, short lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In Granny's Day, she captures Joey and Marky, but feels sympathy for them, when Dee Dee cries on a picture of them with Joey and Marky crossed out. She is the least seen member of Oggy's family except for Oggy's parents, who were seen in a picture in \"Oggy's Grandma\". Oggy's grandma is the only female character to appear on the show to intentionally want to kill/defeat the cockroaches.\n* Monica is Oggy's twin sister and Jack's love-interest. In one episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\", they seem to have a child together. She visits Oggy's house every now and then. She is well known for being very active and likes to take on physical challenges such as [[sky diving]] and [[bungee jumping]]. She's always seen skating around on her [[inline skates]]. Out of all the main characters, she has the least number of appearances; even fewer than Bob. Monica has rarely appeared onscreen with the cockroaches or Bob (until her cameo only with Bob at the end of the 4th-season finale episode \"Oggy is Getting Married! (Featuring Olivia)\"). In the show's Hindi dubbed version, Monica is instead introduced as Oggy's childhood friend, which might be a glitch. After Season 2, she's only appeared in two other episodes, them being \"Deep Trouble\". In a Season 3 episode, she's instead seen wearing a magenta skirt and shoes instead of her rollerskates. This also marks her first appearance without them since her latest appearance in the season 2 episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\". This also marks her first appearance without her baby in a later episode who, as mentioned before, also originated from that episode. The second and latest appearance after season 2 was the season 4 finale \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", where she makes a brief appearance at Oggy and Olivia's wedding as she sits next to Bob. It is unknown, but it is easier to assume she split up with Jack, as their child has never been seen again, that they've never been seen together or have been talking since season 2 and that during that same episode, Jack is staring/ogling at his new partner. She soon became friends with Olivia as in episode of Season 7, \"Sharing Oggy\".\n* Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach introduced in the season 4 episode \"Lady K\", and the roaches' new love interest (mainly Joey). She's the cockroach that lives in Olivia's house, by which Olivia is not aware of. She hates Olivia. She use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or to get her job done.\n* Bobette is the daughter of Bob who is introduced in Season 5. She is Jack's love interest, as seen in the episodes, \" Marky's Tournament\", and \"Jackromeo and Bobette\". She is seen in the episode, \"Emperor for a Day\" as Napoleon's love interest.\n\n==Production==\nAfter a four-year gap in production, Season 5 is planned for release in late 2017 with two more seasons coming later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam makes debut appearance at BLE 2016|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Xilam-makes-debut-appearance-at-BLE-2016-FINAL-V5-23.08.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=23 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011044542/http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Xilam-makes-debut-appearance-at-BLE-2016-FINAL-V5-23.08.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam steers international growth with debut at BLE 2016 and PR agency appointment|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/340-Xilam-steers-international-growth-at-BLE-and-appoints-PR-experts-091....pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011044802/http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/340-Xilam-steers-international-growth-at-BLE-and-appoints-PR-experts-091....pdf|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Season 6 episodes have begun airing on K2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|title=Oggy Forever|language=Italian|accessdate=8 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628014934/http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|archive-date=28 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> while Season 5 will be previewed on Gulli.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.leblogtvnews.com/2017/06/saison-5-inedite-d-oggy-et-les-cafards-avant-premiere-le-30-juin-sur-gulli.html|title=Saison 5 in\u00e9dite d'Oggy et les cafards : avant-premi\u00e8re le 30 juin sur Gulli.|language=French|accessdate=8 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' originates in France, where it aired on networks [[France 3]], [[Canal+]], [[Gulli]] and [[Canal J]].\n\n* In the United States, ''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' initially aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Fox Kids]] block on September 12, 1998, six days after the original French airdate.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oltX9DmpLX8&t=11s</ref> It was soon moved to then-sister channel [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family Channel]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2016/04/04/oggy-gets-exclusive-broadcasting-deal-with-lagardere/|title=Oggy gets exclusive broadcasting deal with Lagard\u00e8re|publisher=}}</ref> in 1999.

The series continued to air on Nickelodeon in that timeslot until the season's episodes were exhausted, and it aired on sister network Nicktoons until 1 May 2015, likely solely for contractual purposes due to Nickelodeon's worldwide deal for the series which requires an airing on its American networks. For future airings of the episode worldwide, and on the official Oggy channel on YouTube, the poster image was replaced with a neutral beach scene.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of French animated television series]]\n* [[List of French television series]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://oggy.com/ Official website]\n* [http://www.xilam.com/portfolio/oggy-and-the-cockroaches/?lang=en Website of the producer Xilam] {{in lang|en}}\n* {{IMDb title|0213363|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* {{bcdb|Other_Studios/X/Xilam_Animation/Oggy_Et_Les_Cafards/|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* [https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCNEKMkg_DG8eAyR1BNWsSvw Official Youtube Channel]\n\n{{Cockroach}}\n{{Xilam}}\n{{Fox Kids}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oggy And The Cockroaches}}\n[[Category:1990s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:1998 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:Canal+ original programming]]\n[[Category:Fox Kids original programming]]\n[[Category:YTV shows]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fictional rivalries]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:French children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about insects]]\n[[Category:Surreal comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Xilam]]\n[[Category:Television series without speech]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|French animated comedy series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = \n| image                    = Oggy and the Cockroaches tittle.jpg\n| caption                  = Oggy (left) with Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey\n| genre                    = [[Surreal comedy]]<br>[[Slapstick]]\n| creator                  = [[Jean-Yves Raimbaud]]\n| developer                = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| director                 = [[Olivier Jean-Marie]]<br>Jean-Christophe Dessaint\n| country                  = [[France]]\n| language                 = No dialogue (text in English or French)\n| music                    = Herv\u00e9 Lavandier <small>(seasons 1\u20132)</small><br />[[Hugues Le Bars]] (seasons 1\u20134)<br />Vincent Artaud (season 5\u20137)\n| num_seasons              = 7 <!--This value to be incremented once an episode from a new season airs-->\n| num_episodes             = 501 <!--This value to be incremented as new episodes air, not before.-->\n| list_episodes            = List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes\n| executive_producer       = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| producer                 = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| editor                   = Laure Charossuett<br>Lou Bouniol<br>Patrick Ducruet\n| runtime                  = 7 minutes\n| company                  = [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont Multimedia]] (seasons 1-2)<br>[[Xilam Animation]] (season 3 onwards)\n| distributor              = <!-- Please provide sourced prose in article body before adding to infobox -->\n| network                  = [[France 3]] (season 1-2)<br>[[Canal+ Family]] (season 3-4)<br>[[Gulli]] (season 1-onwards) <!--Parameter is for original broadcast network only.

The show revolves around the titular characters: the cats Oggy, Jack and the cockroaches Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee. When the show started airing in 1998, it was successful in France and was eventually broadcast worldwide.\n\n==Synopsis==\nOggy, an [[anthropomorphic]] cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating, but is continuously pestered by three roaches, Joey, Dee Dee and Marky (all named after members of the [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]]). The Cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. There are two additional main characters: Oggy's cousin Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the Cockroaches; and Bob, a short-tempered bulldog who is Oggy's neighbor.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n{{section#h|Series overview|page=List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework \u2014 when not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of [[love\u2013hate relationship]] with them, having lived with them for a long time. In the episode \"The Ghost Hunter\", Oggy kills the cockroaches but is terrorized by the spirits. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode \"Priceless Roaches\" and \"So Lonely\") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. Oggy's house appears bigger on the inside, mainly featured in the roller coaster-like staircase scenes. According to executive producer [[Marc du Pontavice]] and [[France Info]], the character of Oggy was named after punk rock musician [[Iggy Pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commeaucinema.com/interviews/oggy-et-les-cafards-le-film-animation-comedie,289933|title=Interview with Marc du Pontavice|accessdate=14 January 2014|language=French}}</ref> and the rock album [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/cartoon-story/2014-ete/oggy-et-les-cafards-08-06-2014-09-55|title=Article on Oggy and the Cockroaches|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=10 August 2014|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/09/18/1954159-oggy-superstar-made-in-france.html|title=La D\u00e9p\u00eache interview|accessdate=19 September 2014|language=French}}</ref> In early episodes, Oggy, like his   [[Tom Cat|Tom and Jerry counterpart]] was the main punching bag in the series. However, in more recent episodes, Oggy has been portrayed as heroic, often triumphing over the cockroaches despite the beatings he takes from them and Bob. Notable other accomplishments include winning the Formula 1, placing first in a marathon, and ultimately winning over his girlfriend Olivia.\n*The Cockroaches are three brothers who antagonize other characters, mainly Oggy and Jack. The cockroaches love pranking them so much, that if the cats were to leave, they would miss them (as seen in the episode \"Moving Out\"). It is also implied that the roaches are named after members of the rock band, [[The Ramones]].\n** Joey (born 15 June 1991)<ref>{{cite episode|season=4|title=Let's Party, Guys!|series=Oggy and the Cockroaches|number=201|credits=Olivier Jean-Marie (director, writer), Fred Mintoff (storyboard)|date=15 July 2012|network=Gulli}}</ref> is a purple-pink body, purple-blue head roach with a [[Heterochromia iridum|pink right eye (originally red) and yellow left eye]], and the oldest brother. Even though he's the smallest roach in the group, most of the time he's the most intelligent, always being the brain in the plans, but is sometimes forced to go solo, because his brothers often think that his plans are stupid. He loves money, but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He is named after lead singer [[Joey Ramone]].\n** Marky is a suave heartbreaking, silvery-grey body, green head roach with pink eyes (originally red, but returned in the ending of the episode \"Teleportation\" where he is stuck in the ice cubes); he is the tallest and middle brother of the three roaches and often doesn't really care about what the two others are doing. While he originally used to love causing mischief just like his brothers, he has grown to be more laid-back in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and causing general mayhem like he has always done. His hobbies are dating puppets and reading books. He also has bad breath, as revealed in the season 1 and season 6 episode \"It's A Small World\". He is named after drummer [[Marky Ramone]].\n** Dee Dee is the ever-hungry cockroach and youngest of the three. He has a blue body, orange head and green eyes. His appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as [[hyena]]s in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect. Other instances include the fish on the wallpaper \"Oggy's Clone\",\" and a [[clownfish]] in \"Scuba Diving\"). He is known to like opera. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling, the juice they produce is toxic and melt objects, as shown in \"Caught in a Trap\". He is named after bassist [[Dee Dee Ramone]]\n* Jack is Oggy's cousin, He is a cat who has an olive green body, yellow eyes, pale Salmon pink tummy and white feet, in the show. He is like the complete opposite of Oggy, as he is more short-tempered, violent and arrogant than him \u2013 a perfect target for the roaches to annoy. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, most of the time resulting in them backfiring, making him less lucky than Oggy in most situations. He is also very interested in chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it). Jack often sleeps over at Oggy's house. At times, he bullies Oggy. Jack seems to be the strongest character in the show. He likes to show off, challenge the roaches and date girls \u2013 mainly Oggy's sister Monica. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches' pranks always make him stop short. In one episode, they seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. Jack also has a morbid fear of heights, as shown in several episodes like the season 4 episode \"The Lighthouse Keeper\". However, in the season 1 episode \"The Rise & The Fall\" Oggy has a fear of heights instead of Jack.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Bob is a fierce brown [[bulldog]] and Oggy's neighbour. He has severe anger management issues.  A running gag in the show has Oggy or Jack doing something that accidentally crushes Bob or shaves his fur or destroys his house, with Bob then pummeling Oggy or Jack off-screen. He does not always pummel Oggy, as seen in a few episodes. He has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in ''Olivia'' and ''Back to the Past!''. He is known to like boxing.\n* Olivia is a white cat (also mainly wearing a yellow bow on her head), who is Oggy's new neighbour and new love interest introduced in season 4. She loves nature, even Oggy's main enemies, the cockroaches, leading to Oggy acting nice to them every time she's around. She is aware of their mischief, so she does stop them when they are around by using some aggressive methods, from her anger to even an painful-looking fly swatter. She always breaks down when someone hurts any part of nature. She also cares a lot about her looks, as seen in the episode \"Olivia's Pimple\", where when she saw a pimple on her face, she refused to leave her house. In the season 4 finale episode \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy get married after a trip to [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], [[Italy]].\n* Oggy's grandma is a very rarely seen character only appearing in three episodes; \"Granny's Day\" in season 1 and \"Oggy's Grandma\" in season 3, where she appears to be very strict with Oggy's mannerisms and in \"Deep Trouble\" beside Monica, as they support Oggy and Jack. In the episodes Granny's Day and Oggy's Grandma, she attacks the cockroaches, and is actually attacked by them in Oggy's Grandma, one time being her head flattened by the lid of Oggy's toilet. She also gets frequent, short lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In Granny's Day, she captures Joey and Marky, but feels sympathy for them, when Dee Dee cries on a picture of them with Joey and Marky crossed out. She is the least seen member of Oggy's family except for Oggy's parents, who were seen in a picture in \"Oggy's Grandma\". Oggy's grandma is the only female character to appear on the show to intentionally want to kill/defeat the cockroaches.\n* Monica is Oggy's twin sister and Jack's love-interest. In one episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\", they seem to have a child together. She visits Oggy's house every now and then. She is well known for being very active and likes to take on physical challenges such as [[sky diving]] and [[bungee jumping]]. She's always seen skating around on her [[inline skates]]. Out of all the main characters, she has the least number of appearances; even fewer than Bob. Monica has rarely appeared onscreen with the cockroaches or Bob (until her cameo only with Bob at the end of the 4th-season finale episode \"Oggy is Getting Married! (Featuring Olivia)\"). In the show's Hindi dubbed version, Monica is instead introduced as Oggy's childhood friend, which might be a glitch. After Season 2, she's only appeared in two other episodes, them being \"Deep Trouble\". In a Season 3 episode, she's instead seen wearing a magenta skirt and shoes instead of her rollerskates. This also marks her first appearance without them since her latest appearance in the season 2 episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\". This also marks her first appearance without her baby in a later episode who, as mentioned before, also originated from that episode. The second and latest appearance after season 2 was the season 4 finale \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", where she makes a brief appearance at Oggy and Olivia's wedding as she sits next to Bob. It is unknown, but it is easier to assume she split up with Jack, as their child has never been seen again, that they've never been seen together or have been talking since season 2 and that during that same episode, Jack is staring/ogling at his new partner. She soon became friends with Olivia as in episode of Season 7, \"Sharing Oggy\".\n* Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach introduced in the season 4 episode \"Lady K\", and the roaches' new love interest (mainly Joey). She's the cockroach that lives in Olivia's house, by which Olivia is not aware of. She hates Olivia. She use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or to get her job done.\n* Bobette is the daughter of Bob who is introduced in Season 5. She is Jack's love interest, as seen in the episodes, \" Marky's Tournament\", and \"Jackromeo and Bobette\". She is seen in the episode, \"Emperor for a Day\" as Napoleon's love interest.\n\n==Production==\nAfter a four-year gap in production, Season 5 is planned for release in late 2017 with two more seasons coming later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam makes debut appearance at BLE 2016|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Xilam-makes-debut-appearance-at-BLE-2016-FINAL-V5-23.08.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=23 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011044542/http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Xilam-makes-debut-appearance-at-BLE-2016-FINAL-V5-23.08.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam steers international growth with debut at BLE 2016 and PR agency appointment|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/340-Xilam-steers-international-growth-at-BLE-and-appoints-PR-experts-091....pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011044802/http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/340-Xilam-steers-international-growth-at-BLE-and-appoints-PR-experts-091....pdf|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Season 6 episodes have begun airing on K2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|title=Oggy Forever|language=Italian|accessdate=8 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628014934/http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|archive-date=28 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> while Season 5 will be previewed on Gulli.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.leblogtvnews.com/2017/06/saison-5-inedite-d-oggy-et-les-cafards-avant-premiere-le-30-juin-sur-gulli.html|title=Saison 5 in\u00e9dite d'Oggy et les cafards : avant-premi\u00e8re le 30 juin sur Gulli.|language=French|accessdate=8 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' originates in France, where it aired on networks [[France 3]], [[Canal+]], [[Gulli]] and [[Canal J]].\n\n* In the United States, ''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' initially aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Fox Kids]] block on September 12, 1998, six days after the original French airdate.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oltX9DmpLX8&t=11s</ref> It was soon moved to then-sister channel [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family Channel]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2016/04/04/oggy-gets-exclusive-broadcasting-deal-with-lagardere/|title=Oggy gets exclusive broadcasting deal with Lagard\u00e8re|publisher=}}</ref> in 1999.

The series continued to air on Nickelodeon in that timeslot until the season's episodes were exhausted, and it aired on sister network Nicktoons until 1 May 2015, likely solely for contractual purposes due to Nickelodeon's worldwide deal for the series which requires an airing on its American networks. For future airings of the episode worldwide, and on the official Oggy channel on YouTube, the poster image was replaced with a neutral beach scene.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of French animated television series]]\n* [[List of French television series]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://oggy.com/ Official website]\n* [http://www.xilam.com/portfolio/oggy-and-the-cockroaches/?lang=en Website of the producer Xilam] {{in lang|en}}\n* {{IMDb title|0213363|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* {{bcdb|Other_Studios/X/Xilam_Animation/Oggy_Et_Les_Cafards/|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* [https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCNEKMkg_DG8eAyR1BNWsSvw Official Youtube Channel]\n\n{{Cockroach}}\n{{Xilam}}\n{{Fox Kids}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oggy And The Cockroaches}}\n[[Category:1990s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:1998 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:Canal+ original programming]]\n[[Category:Fox Kids original programming]]\n[[Category:YTV shows]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fictional rivalries]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:French children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about insects]]\n[[Category:Surreal comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Xilam]]\n[[Category:Television series without speech]]\n", "name_user": "112.79.93.137", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oggy_and_the_Cockroaches"}

Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[AT&T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. Launched in 1994, TCM is headquartered at Turner's Techwood broadcasting campus in the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] business district of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nThe channel's programming consists mainly of [[Golden age (metaphor)|classic]] theatrically released [[feature film]]s from the [[Turner Entertainment]] film library \u2013 which comprises films from [[Warner Bros.]] (covering films released before 1950), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (covering films released before May 1986), and the North American distribution rights to films from [[RKO Pictures]]. However, TCM also licenses films from other studios, and occasionally shows more recent films.\n\nThe channel is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, [[Latin America]], France,  Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the [[Nordic countries]], the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nIn 1986, eight years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, [[Ted Turner]] acquired the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio for $1.5 billion. Concerns over [[Turner Entertainment]]'s corporate [[debt]] load resulted in [[Turner Entertainment#Background|Turner selling the studio]] that October back to [[Kirk Kerkorian]], from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before.<ref name=\"Fabrikant\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/07/business/turner-to-sell-mgm-assets.html Fabrikant, Geraldine. \"Turner to Sell MGM Assets.\"] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 7, 1986.</ref>\n\nAs part of the deal, Turner Entertainment retained ownership of MGM's library of films released up to May 9, 1986. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and reincorporated as [[MGM/UA Communications Co.]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe film library of Turner Entertainment would serve as the base form of programming for TCM upon the network's launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner's library of movies aired on the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]'s advertiser-supported cable network [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] \u2013 along with [[colorized]] versions of black-and-white classics such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''.\n\n===Launch and contributions===\n\n[[File:Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Turner Classic Movies.jpg|thumb|In May 2009, host Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh, senior vice president for programming, accepted TCM's Institutional [[Peabody Award]] \"for a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept\u2014the place of film in social and cultural experience\".<ref name=\"Peabody\">{{cite web |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/institutional-award-turner-classic-movies |title=The Peabody Awards, Institutional Award: Turner Classic Movies (TCM) |publisher=Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Georgia |access-date=2018-07-12 }}</ref>]]\nTurner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], with [[Ted Turner]] launching the channel at a ceremony in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164443/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15426709.html Mitchell, Kim; Rod Granger. \"Turner launches TCM\"], ''[[Multichannel News]]'', April 18, 1994.

AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002.\n\nIn 1996, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] merged with [[Time Warner]] which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]] under the same corporate umbrella, also gave TCM access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar]], [[Saul Zaentz]] and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, TCM had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164234/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14791509.html \"Turner picks up Warner films\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', December 6, 1993.

As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 [[Rudolph Valentino]] film ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'', two [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] films: 1921's ''[[The Ace of Hearts (1921 film)|The Ace of Hearts]]'' and 1928's ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'', and [[Greta Garbo]]'s 1926 film ''[[The Temptress]]''.\n\n===TCM Classic Film Festival===\n\nIn April 2010, Turner Classic Movies held the first TCM Classic Film Festival, an event\u2014now held annually\u2014at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]] and the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Initially hosted by [[Robert Osborne]], the four-day long annual festival celebrates Hollywood and its movies, and featured celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic movies including several newly restored by ''[[The Film Foundation]]'', an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood's classic film legacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605175654/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |title=New TCM Film Festival goes head-to-head with Tribeca |publisher=New York Post |date=November 5, 2009 |first=Lou |last=Lumenick |accessdate=2012-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nTurner Classic Movies essentially operates as a [[television commercial|commercial]]-free service, with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features \u2013 which advertise TCM products, [[Promo (media)|network promotions]] for upcoming special programs and the original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM (particularly those that will air during the primetime hours), and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects \u2013 from series such as ''The Passing Parade'', ''Crime Does Not Pay'', ''[[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith Specialties]]'', and [[Robert Benchley]] \u2013 under the banner name ''TCM Extras'' (formerly ''One Reel Wonders''). In 2007, some of the [[short film]]s featured on TCM were made available for [[streaming media|streaming]] on TCM's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.\n\nTCM's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or [[post-production|post-produced]] in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[MPAA film ratings system|ratings system]] and the concurrent disestablishment of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a [[pay television|premium channel]] with certain films \u2013 particularly those made from the 1960s onward \u2013 sometimes featuring [[nudity]], sexual content, [[violence]] and/or strong [[profanity]]; the network also features rating [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the [[TV Parental Guidelines]], in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).\n\nThe network's programming season runs from March of one year until the following February of the next when a retrospective of [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called ''[[31 Days of Oscar]]''. As a result of its devoted format to classic [[feature film]]s, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as [[Barbara Stanwyck]] or [[Greta Garbo]] or actors like [[Cary Grant]] or [[Humphrey Bogart]] have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] ([[widescreen]] or full screen) whenever possible \u2013 widescreen films broadcast on TCM are [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] on the network's [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed. TCM also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any [[home video]] release.\n\nOccasionally, TCM shows restored versions of films, particularly old [[silent film]]s with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the [[Descriptive Video Service]] (created by [[Boston]] [[PBS]] member station [[WGBH-TV]]), with many of the films aired on the network offering [[video description|visual description]] for the [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]], which is accessible through the [[second audio program]] option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.\n\n===''Now Playing''===\nTCM publishes ''Now Playing'', a monthly guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provides daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlights a featured actor on the cover, and features essays about the \"guest programmer\" as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host [[Robert Osborne]], contained \"Remembering Robert Osborne\" by [[Ben Mankiewicz]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TCM:NOW PLAYING: A Viewer's Guide to Turner Classic Movies.|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|date=May 2017|location=Palm Coast, Florida|pages=46}}</ref> TCM ceased print publication of ''Now Playing'' (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.<ref>\"TCM To Cease Printing the Now Playing Guide\" http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2017/04/tcm-to-cease-printing-now-playing-guide.html</ref>\n\nDuring the prime time hours, an ident for the \"Watch TCM\" app is shown after every movie.\n\n===Movie library===\nTCM's library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles.

February and August are the only months to not have a \"Star of the Month\" due to special programming months. The network also marks the occurrence of a film actor's birthday (either [[Wikt:antemortem|antemortem]] or posthumously) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasing several of that artist's best, earliest or least-known pictures; by effect, marathons scheduled in honor of an actor's passing (which are scheduled within a month after their death) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date. TCM also features a monthly program block called the \"TCM Guest Programmer\", in which the host is joined by celebrity guests responsible for choosing that evening's films (examples of such programmers during 2012 include [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Anthony Bourdain]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Regis Philbin]] and [[Jim Lehrer]]);<ref>{{cite web| title= TCM Announces Guest Programmers for 2012, Including Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer | url= http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/tcm-announces-guest-programmers-for-2012-including-jules-feiffer-anthony-bourdain-debra-winger-ellen-barkin-spike-lee-regis-philbin-and-jim-lehrer/121401/ | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227024440/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/tcm-announces-guest-programmers-for-2012-including-jules-feiffer-anthony-bourdain-debra-winger-ellen-barkin-spike-lee-regis-philbin-and-jim-lehrer/121401/ | url-status= dead | archive-date= February 27, 2012 | date= February 22, 2012| first=Sara|last= Bibel | work= Press release | accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> an offshoot of this block featuring Turner Classic Movies employees aired during February 2011.\n\n''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'', with various hosts since 2001, is a weekly film showcase airing on Saturday evenings at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time which spotlights a culturally significant movie and contains a special introduction and post-movie discussion.\n\nOne of the weekly blocks is \"Noir Alley\", featuring [[film noir]] movies. It broadcasts on Sunday mornings at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time and is hosted by [[Eddie Muller]]. The channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each Sunday: \"Silent Sunday Nights\", which features [[silent film]]s from the United States and abroad, usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores, and hosted by [[Jacqueline Stewart]]; and \"TCM Imports\" (which previously ran on Saturdays until the early 2000s{{Specify|date=March 2012}}), a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries. ''[[TCM Underground]]'' \u2013 which debuted in October 2006 \u2013 as Saturday late night block which focuses on [[cult film]]s, the block was originally hosted by rocker/filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] until December 2006 (though {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, it is the only regular film presentation block on the channel that does not have a host). ''[[TCM Underground]]'' recently changed its timeslot - it now airs early Saturday mornings at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time\n\n====Seasonal blocks====\nTurner Classic Movies suspends its regular schedule twice each season for a special month of film marathons.  One is the \"31 Days of Oscar\" mentioned earlier, and another called \"Summer Under the Stars\", which features entire daily schedules devoted to the work of a particular actor, with movies and specials that pertain to the star of the day. In the summer of 2007, the channel debuted \"Funday Night at the Movies\", a block hosted by actor [[Tom Kenny]] (best known as the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]]). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'') aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families.\n\n\"Funday Night at the Movies\" was replaced in 2008 by \"Essentials Jr.\", a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'' (originally hosted by actors [[Abigail Breslin]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]], then by [[John Lithgow]] from 2009 to 2011, and then by [[Bill Hader]], starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'', ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'', and ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'', as well as more eclectic selections, such as ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'', ''[[The Music Box]]'', ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', and ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.\n\nIn 2014, the channel debuted \"Treasures from the Disney Vault\", hosted by [[Leonard Maltin]]. This block showcased a compilation of vintage [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] feature films, cartoons, documentaries, episodes of the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series]]'', and episodes of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.

In December 1994, TCM debuted \"TCM Remembers\", a tribute to recently deceased notable film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers, and cinematographers) that occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous classic film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work.\n\nEvery December, a longer, more inclusive \"TCM Remembers\" interstitial is produced that honors all of the noted film personalities who died during the past year, interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down and is being dismantled (2013). Since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by [[Indie rock|indie]] artists and/or singer-songwriters such as [[Badly Drawn Boy]] (2007) or [[Steve Earle]] (2009).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html |title=TCM Remembers 2009 |work=TCM Website |year=2009 |access-date=11 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822052439/http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html |archive-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> 2015's song, \"Quickly Now\", was written especially for ''TCM Remembers'' by Chuck Moore and Reid Hall, and sung by Eryn McHugh.<ref>[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quickly-now-tcm-remembers-2015/id1016072611?i=1000359791573 'Quickly Now' at Apple Podcasts, with songwriting credit information.

Initial programming was not available in native high definition and was instead upconverted from [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], but benefited from the greater bandwidth allocated to the channel. By November 2014, film masters meant for high definition presentation, along with Osborne and Mankiewicz-hosted continuity had transitioned to the format (though films meant to be presented in the [[Academy ratio]] or other [[anamorphic format]]s lower than 16:9 are presented as intended by the director or studio with the appropriate black boxing around the frame).\n\n==Merchandising==\n\n===TCM Vault Collection===\nThe '''TCM Vault Collection''' consists of several different [[DVD]] collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister [[Warner Home Video]]). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or [[VHS]]. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the TCM library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).\n* ''Universal Collection'' \u2013 Featuring films licensed by TCM from the [[Universal Studios]] vault.\n* ''The Lost RKO Collection'' \u2013 Featuring RKO films from the 1930s.\n* ''TCM Spotlight'' \u2013 A series of DVD boxsets released by Warner Home Video featuring [[Charlie Chan]] and stars such as [[Esther Williams]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Deanna Durbin]], and [[Doris Day]].\n\nIn October 2015, TCM announced the launch of the TCM Wineclub, in which they teamed up with Laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Ford Coppola's]] winery.  Wines are available in 3-month subscriptions and can be selected as reds, whites, or a mixture of both.  From the wines chosen, TCM also includes recommended movies to watch with each, such as a \"True Grit\" wine, to be paired with the [[John Wayne]] film [[True Grit (1969 film)|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Tcmwineclub.com|title=About TCM Wine Club|url=http://tcmwineclub.com/about-tcm-wine-club}}</ref>\n\n==International versions==\n{{main|List of international Turner Classic Movies channels}}\nTurner Classic Movies is available in many other countries around the world. In Canada, TCM began to be carried on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] and satellite provider [[Shaw Direct]] in 2005. [[Rogers Cable]] started offering TCM in December 2006 as a [[free preview]] for subscribers of its [[digital cable]] tier, and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally the same as that of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of TCM are available in France, Greece, Italy, Middle East, Africa, Spain, Asia, [[Latin America]], [[Nordic countries]], the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta.

Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[AT&T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. Launched in 1994, TCM is headquartered at Turner's Techwood broadcasting campus in the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] business district of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\nThe channel's programming consists mainly of [[Golden age (metaphor)|classic]] theatrically released [[feature film]]s from the [[Turner Entertainment]] film library \u2013 which comprises films from [[Warner Bros.]] (covering films released before 1950), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (covering films released before May 1986), and the North American distribution rights to films from [[RKO Pictures]]. However, TCM also licenses films from other studios, and occasionally shows more recent films.\n\nThe channel is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, [[Latin America]], France,  Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the [[Nordic countries]], the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nIn 1986, eight years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, [[Ted Turner]] acquired the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio for $1.5 billion. Concerns over [[Turner Entertainment]]'s corporate [[debt]] load resulted in [[Turner Entertainment#Background|Turner selling the studio]] that October back to [[Kirk Kerkorian]], from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before.<ref name=\"Fabrikant\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/07/business/turner-to-sell-mgm-assets.html Fabrikant, Geraldine. \"Turner to Sell MGM Assets.\"] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 7, 1986.</ref>\n\nAs part of the deal, Turner Entertainment retained ownership of MGM's library of films released up to May 9, 1986. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and reincorporated as [[MGM/UA Communications Co.]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe film library of Turner Entertainment would serve as the base form of programming for TCM upon the network's launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner's library of movies aired on the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]'s advertiser-supported cable network [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] \u2013 along with [[colorized]] versions of black-and-white classics such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''.\n\n===Launch and contributions===\n\n[[File:Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Turner Classic Movies.jpg|thumb|In May 2009, host Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh, senior vice president for programming, accepted TCM's Institutional [[Peabody Award]] \"for a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept\u2014the place of film in social and cultural experience\".<ref name=\"Peabody\">{{cite web |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/institutional-award-turner-classic-movies |title=The Peabody Awards, Institutional Award: Turner Classic Movies (TCM) |publisher=Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Georgia |access-date=2018-07-12 }}</ref>]]\nTurner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], with [[Ted Turner]] launching the channel at a ceremony in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164443/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15426709.html Mitchell, Kim; Rod Granger. \"Turner launches TCM\"], ''[[Multichannel News]]'', April 18, 1994.

AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002.\n\nIn 1996, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] merged with [[Time Warner]] which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]] under the same corporate umbrella, also gave TCM access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar]], [[Saul Zaentz]] and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, TCM had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164234/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14791509.html \"Turner picks up Warner films\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', December 6, 1993.

TCM, along with [[Cartoon Network]], [[Adult Swim]], and over-the-top video company [[Otter Media]], will be moved directly under Warner Bros. (the remaining Turner networks will be divided into WarnerMedia Entertainment and WarnerMedia News & Sports divisions). Speaking about the move, then-Warner Bros.

As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 [[Rudolph Valentino]] film ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'', two [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] films: 1921's ''[[The Ace of Hearts (1921 film)|The Ace of Hearts]]'' and 1928's ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'', and [[Greta Garbo]]'s 1926 film ''[[The Temptress]]''.\n\n===TCM Classic Film Festival===\n\nIn April 2010, Turner Classic Movies held the first TCM Classic Film Festival, an event\u2014now held annually\u2014at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]] and the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Initially hosted by [[Robert Osborne]], the four-day long annual festival celebrates Hollywood and its movies, and featured celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic movies including several newly restored by ''[[The Film Foundation]]'', an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood's classic film legacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605175654/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |title=New TCM Film Festival goes head-to-head with Tribeca |publisher=New York Post |date=November 5, 2009 |first=Lou |last=Lumenick |accessdate=2012-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\nTurner Classic Movies essentially operates as a [[television commercial|commercial]]-free service, with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features \u2013 which advertise TCM products, [[Promo (media)|network promotions]] for upcoming special programs and the original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM (particularly those that will air during the primetime hours), and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects \u2013 from series such as ''The Passing Parade'', ''Crime Does Not Pay'', ''[[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith Specialties]]'', and [[Robert Benchley]] \u2013 under the banner name ''TCM Extras'' (formerly ''One Reel Wonders''). In 2007, some of the [[short film]]s featured on TCM were made available for [[streaming media|streaming]] on TCM's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.\n\nTCM's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or [[post-production|post-produced]] in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[MPAA film ratings system|ratings system]] and the concurrent disestablishment of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a [[pay television|premium channel]] with certain films \u2013 particularly those made from the 1960s onward \u2013 sometimes featuring [[nudity]], sexual content, [[violence]] and/or strong [[profanity]]; the network also features rating [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the [[TV Parental Guidelines]], in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).\n\nThe network's programming season runs from March of one year until the following February of the next when a retrospective of [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called ''[[31 Days of Oscar]]''. As a result of its devoted format to classic [[feature film]]s, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as [[Barbara Stanwyck]] or [[Greta Garbo]] or actors like [[Cary Grant]] or [[Humphrey Bogart]] have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] ([[widescreen]] or full screen) whenever possible \u2013 widescreen films broadcast on TCM are [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] on the network's [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed. TCM also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any [[home video]] release.\n\nOccasionally, TCM shows restored versions of films, particularly old [[silent film]]s with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the [[Descriptive Video Service]] (created by [[Boston]] [[PBS]] member station [[WGBH-TV]]), with many of the films aired on the network offering [[video description|visual description]] for the [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]], which is accessible through the [[second audio program]] option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.\n\n===''Now Playing''===\nTCM publishes ''Now Playing'', a monthly guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provides daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlights a featured actor on the cover, and features essays about the \"guest programmer\" as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host [[Robert Osborne]], contained \"Remembering Robert Osborne\" by [[Ben Mankiewicz]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TCM:NOW PLAYING: A Viewer's Guide to Turner Classic Movies.|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|date=May 2017|location=Palm Coast, Florida|pages=46}}</ref> TCM ceased print publication of ''Now Playing'' (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.<ref>\"TCM To Cease Printing the Now Playing Guide\" http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2017/04/tcm-to-cease-printing-now-playing-guide.html</ref>\n\nDuring the prime time hours, an ident for the \"Watch TCM\" app is shown after every movie.\n\n===Movie library===\nTCM's library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles.

February and August are the only months to not have a \"Star of the Month\" due to special programming months. The network also marks the occurrence of a film actor's birthday (either [[Wikt:antemortem|antemortem]] or posthumously) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasing several of that artist's best, earliest or least-known pictures; by effect, marathons scheduled in honor of an actor's passing (which are scheduled within a month after their death) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date.

It broadcasts on Sunday mornings at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time and is hosted by [[Eddie Muller]]. The channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each Sunday: \"Silent Sunday Nights\", which features [[silent film]]s from the United States and abroad, usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores, and hosted by [[Jacqueline Stewart]]; and \"TCM Imports\" (which previously ran on Saturdays until the early 2000s{{Specify|date=March 2012}}), a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries.

One is the \u201c31 Days of Oscar\u201d mentioned earlier, and another called \"Summer Under the Stars\", which features entire daily schedules devoted to the work of a particular actor, with movies and specials that pertain to the star of the day. In the summer of 2007, the channel debuted \"Funday Night at the Movies\", a block hosted by actor [[Tom Kenny]] (best known as the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]]). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'') aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families.\n\n\"Funday Night at the Movies\" was replaced in 2008 by \"Essentials Jr.\", a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'' (originally hosted by actors [[Abigail Breslin]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]], then by [[John Lithgow]] from 2009 to 2011, and then by [[Bill Hader]], starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'', ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'', and ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'', as well as more eclectic selections, such as ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'', ''[[The Music Box]]'', ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', and ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.\n\nIn 2014, the channel debuted \"Treasures from the Disney Vault\", hosted by [[Leonard Maltin]]. This block showcased a compilation of vintage [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] feature films, cartoons, documentaries, episodes of the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series]]'', and episodes of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.

In December 1994, TCM debuted \"TCM Remembers\", a tribute to recently deceased notable film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers, and cinematographers) that occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous classic film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work.\n\nEvery December, a longer, more inclusive \"TCM Remembers\" interstitial is produced that honors all of the noted film personalities who died during the past year, interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down and is being dismantled (2013). Since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by [[Indie rock|indie]] artists and/or singer-songwriters such as [[Badly Drawn Boy]] (2007) or [[Steve Earle]] (2009).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html |title=TCM Remembers 2009 |work=TCM Website |year=2009 |access-date=11 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822052439/http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html |archive-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> 2015's song, \"Quickly Now\", was written especially for ''TCM Remembers'' by Chuck Moore and Reid Hall, and sung by Eryn McHugh.<ref>[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/quickly-now-tcm-remembers-2015/id1016072611?i=1000359791573 'Quickly Now' at Apple Podcasts, with songwriting credit information.
