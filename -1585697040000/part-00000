The organization is responsible for the daily news and information gathering of its news programs.\n\nIt serves the main [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], the Regional Network Group, the UHF sports channel [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], the cable channels [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the international channel [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], the flagship radio station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and the regional radio networks [[DYAP-AM|DYAP 765 Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB 1512 Cebu]] and [[DXAB|DXAB 1296 Davao]] and news websites [[ABS-CBNnews.com|news.abs-cbn.com]] and patrol.ph.\n\n==History==\n===News division===\nThe oldest of the two components, the news division began as the news section of two radio stations - DZBC (opened 1949) and DZAQ (opened 1950) both in the Manila area, and DZRI (opened 1951) in Pangasinan, all under the Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later under the Alto Broadcasting System, which broadcast news programs and commentary as part of their programming schedules. In 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network, together with the first news broadcasts on DZXL, started the shortlived 24-hour station DZQL ''Radyo Reloj'' broadcasting news and current affairs until late 1959, the first station of its kind in the country. When the two networks merged in 1957, first as part of Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later on in 1961 adopting the ABS-CBN brand (which it changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967 and ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010), the news services of these four Manila stations, later reduced to three, were combined into a unified news service but then with separate programs, as the network began expanding with the purchase and later opening of additional stations, first in the Ilocos region and the Cordillera, and then into the Visayas islands, Mindanao, and southern parts of Luzon, with the national radio service broadcasting from the Chronicle Building along Aduana street, Intramuros, Manila, which began broadcasting the two Manila stations in 1958. Alongside them was a small television news service on DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9 with updates broadcast daily, owing to the lack of proper news programs from the beginning of broadcasts in late 1953, with both stations' news bureaus based in the television studios in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City (opened in 1958).\n\nProper news programming on TV, however, would begin in 1960 when news coverage for the national elections began, followed by the first Filipino-language TV newscast, ''[[Balita Ngayon]]'', in 1966 on Channel 3 and in the following year with the English-language newscast ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV series)|The World Tonight]]'' on late nights, which is today the longest running English-language national newscast. Channel 9 followed suit with the long-running ''[[Newsbreak (TV program)|Newsbreak]]'' as well. By 1968, following the aftermath of the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by the quake), leading to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in August that same year, the joint radio and color television coverage of which was the first time ever for a Philippine media company to do so, DZAQ was later converted into a 24-hour Filipino language news and current affairs radio station, adopting the ''DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960'' branding under the initiative of former station manager [[Orly Mercado]], veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]], Ben Aniceto, the then ABS-CBN program director and [[Chief engineer|Chief Engr.]] Emil Solidum, whose efforts led to the recruitment of the first generation of mobile field reporters for news coverage and flash reports, a first for any radio station at that time. The station would prove to be a leading source of breaking news stories in the late 1960s and before Martial Law stopped broadcasts in September 1972, Radyo Patrol services were operational in select regional stations, alongside an active service of regional programming in all provincial TV stations in addition to occasional nationwide broadcasts via satellite, the first for any station by then.\n\nIn July of 1986, the news services of ABS-CBN were officially reactivated as part of the network's return to former owners, when DZMM was offically relaunched that month from the Benpres Building in the [[Ortigas Center]] District of Pasig City. The new station broadcast its newscasts twice daily, Mondays to Saturdays, with a Sunday midday news program.\n\n===Current affairs division===\nThe division traces its roots to the current affairs and commentary programming that both DZAQ and later on DZXL aired beginning in the mid-1950s in both Filipino and English, keeping listeners informed of the latest issues that affect Filipinos.\n\n==Divisions==\nThe division operates mainly and headquartered at ABS-CBN Broadcast Complex in [[Quezon City]] while the ABS-CBN regional stations also have their local news divisions, which is a big help in newsgathering for the whole network. It also has news bureaus in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and the [[Middle East]] with the help of [[The Filipino Channel]] (owned by ABS-CBN Global, Ltd.), these make ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs ahead among the other news organizations in the country as they were the largest and the most comprehensive when it comes to local and international newsgathering.\n\nThe division is currently headed by long-time journalist and former ABS-CBN\u2019s North America Bureau Chief, and now ABS-CBN's Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs Ging Reyes. It is further subdivided into different subgroups:\n* '''Integrated News Operations Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist and former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter, Claude Vitug.\n* '''News Gathering Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter and former Middle East News Bureau chief, Dindo Amparo.\n* '''Current Affairs Group''', headed by experienced news department staff, Dondi Ocampo.\n* '''News Production Group''', headed by Marielle Gaceta-Catbagan.\n* '''Investigative and Research Group''', headed by experienced news department staff and former reporter for Manila Standard Today, Chi Almario-Gonzales.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Channel''', headed by its Chief Operating Officer and veteran ABS-CBN News correspondent and former ABS-CBN News North America Bureau Chief, Nadia Trinidad.\n* '''Regional Network Group News and Current Affairs''', headed by television journalist and former Head of News for ABS-CBN Iloilo, [[Stanley Palisada]].\n* '''Global News Bureaus''', headed by Alcuin Papa.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Digital''', headed by its executive editor and veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former senior political correspondent and former ABS-CBN News chief of reporters, Lynda Jumilla. \n* '''ABS-CBN Weather Center''' is the [[weather forecasting]] division of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs.\n* '''[[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* '''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station on Television headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* ''DocuCentral'' is the producer of highly acclaimed documentaries shown on ABS-CBN's platforms.\n\nAside from regular programming, it also operates the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC), the first and the only 24-hour [[English language]] news channel in the country. The division also operates a news website [[ABS-CBNnews.com]] in partnership with ''[[BusinessMirror]]''.\n\n[[File:ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.png|thumb|right|200px|Logo used from 2000 to

The organization is responsible for the daily news and information gathering of its news programs.\n\nIt serves the main [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], the Regional Network Group, the UHF sports channel [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], the cable channels [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the international channel [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], the flagship radio station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and the regional radio networks [[DYAP-AM|DYAP 765 Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB 1512 Cebu]] and [[DXAB|DXAB 1296 Davao]] and news websites [[ABS-CBNnews.com|news.abs-cbn.com]] and patrol.ph.\n\n==History==\n===News division===\nThe oldest of the two components, the news division began as the news section of two radio stations - DZBC (opened 1949) and DZAQ (opened 1950) both in the Manila area, and DZRI (opened 1951) in Pangasinan, all under the Bolinao Eletronics Corporation and later under the Alto Broadcasting System, which broadcast news programs and commentary as part of their programming schedules. In 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network, together with the first news broadcasts on DZXL, started the shortlived 24-hour station DZQL ''Radyo Reloj'' broadcasting news and current affairs until late 1959, the first station of its kind in the country. When the two networks merged in 1957, first as part of Bolinao Eletronics Corporation and later on in 1961 adopting the ABS-CBN brand (which it changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967 and ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010), the news services of these four Manila stations, later reduced to three, were combined into a unified news service but then with separate programs, as the network began expanding with the purchase and later opening of additional stations, first in the Ilocos region and the Cordillera, and then into the Visayas islands, Mindanao, and southern parts of Luzon, with the national radio service broadcasting from the Chronicle Building along Aduana street, Intramuros, Manila, which began broadcasting the two Manila stations in 1958. Alongside them was a small television news service on DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9 with updates broadcast daily, owing to the lack of proper news programs from the beginning of broadcasts in late 1953, with both stations' news bureaus based in the television studios in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City (opened in 1958).\n\nProper news programming on TV, however, would begin in 1960 when news coverage for the national elections began, followed by the first Filipino-language TV newscast, ''[[Balita Ngayon]]'', in 1966 on Channel 3 and in the following year with the English-language newscast ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV series)|The World Tonight]]'' on late nights, which is today the longest running English-language national newscast. Channel 9 followed suit with the long running ''[[Newsbreak (TV program)|Newsbreak]]'' as well. By 1968, following the aftermath of the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by the quake), leading to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in August that same year, the joint radio and color television coverage of which was the first time ever for a Philippine media company to do so, DZAQ was later converted into a 24-hour Filipino language news and current affairs radio station, adopting the ''DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960'' branding under the initiative of former station manager [[Orly Mercado]], veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]], Ben Aniceto, the then ABS-CBN program director and [[Chief engineer|Chief Engr.]] Emil Solidum, whose efforts led to the recruitment of the first generation of mobile field reporters for news coverage and flash reports, a first for any radio station at that time. The station would prove to be a leading source of breaking news stories in the late 1960s and before Martial Law stopped broadcasts in September 1972, Radyo Patrol services were operational in select regional stations, alongside an active service of regional programming in all provincial TV stations in addition to occasional nationwide broadcasts via satellite, the first for any station by then.\n\nIn July of 1986, the news services of ABS-CBN were officially reactivated as part of the network's return to former owners, when DZMM was offically relaunched that month from the Benpres Building in the [[Ortigas Center]] District of Pasig City. The new station broadcast its newscasts twice daily, Mondays to Saturdays, with a Sunday midday news program.\n\n===Current affairs division===\nThe division traces its roots to the current affairs and commentary programming that both DZAQ and later on DZXL aired beginning in the mid-1950s in both Filipino and English, keeping listeners informed of the latest issues that affect Filipinos.\n\n==Divisions==\nThe division operates mainly and headquartered at ABS-CBN Broadcast Complex in [[Quezon City]] while the ABS-CBN regional stations also have their local news divisions, which is a big help in newsgathering for the whole network. It also has a news bureaus  in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and the [[Middle East]] with the help of [[The Filipino Channel]] (owned by ABS-CBN Global, Ltd.), these make ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs ahead among the other news organizations in the country as they were the largest and the most comprehensive when it comes to local and international newsgathering.\n\nThe division is currently headed by long-time journalist and former ABS-CBN\u2019s North America Bureau Chief, and now ABS-CBN's Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs Ging Reyes. It is further subdivided into different subgroups:\n* '''Integrated News Operations Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist and former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter, Claude Vitug.\n* '''News Gathering Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter and former Middle East News Bureau chief, Dindo Amparo.\n* '''Current Affairs Group''', headed by experienced news department staff, Dondi Ocampo.\n* '''News Production Group''', headed by Marielle Gaceta-Catbagan.\n* '''Investigative and Research Group''', headed by experienced news department staff and former reporter for Manila Standard Today, Chi Almario-Gonzales.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Channel''', headed by its Chief Operating Officer and veteran ABS-CBN News correspondent and former ABS-CBN News North America Bureau Chief, Nadia Trinidad.\n* '''Regional Network Group News and Current Affairs''', headed by television journalist and former Head of News for ABS-CBN Iloilo, [[Stanley Palisada]].\n* '''Global News Bureaus''', headed by Alcuin Papa.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Digital''', headed by its executive editor and veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former senior political correspondent and former ABS-CBN News chief of reporters, Lynda Jumilla. \n* '''ABS-CBN Weather Center''' is the [[weather forecasting]] division of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs.\n* '''[[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* '''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station on Television headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* ''DocuCentral'' is the producer of highly acclaimed documentaries that shown on ABS-CBN's platforms.\n\nAside from regular programming, it also operates the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC), the first and the only 24-hour [[English language]] news channel in the country.

The plot follows a soldier returning from World War II who marries the woman of his dreams, but he is unable to consummate his marriage, ruining the couple's chances of a shared happiness.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the spring of 1946, Ivan, an American soldier, returns home psychologically scarred after spending some time in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. Once back in his small Pennsylvania town, Ivan settles in, trying to put his life back together while living with his stoic peasant father.\n\nShortly after his arrival, Ivan looks for his childhood sweetheart, Maria, a beautiful woman who is taking care of her old deaf grandmother. However, he is disappointed to find Maria in the arms of Al, a captain. Ivan's father thinks that Maria is too good for his son, but perhaps good enough for himself. He pairs his son with Mrs Wynic, a flirty neighbor. Ivan has sex with her, but he is tormented by the traumas of the war. He tells her that it was his dreams about Maria that allowed him to survive the prison camp.\n\nIvan is given a hero's welcoming by his community, formed by immigrants from Yugoslavia. During the celebrations, when Al goes to dance with one of Maria's friends, Ivan grabs the opportunity to get close to her. Together they leave the party on his motorbike, heading for their favorite spot of years ago. He gives her a pair of earrings that he planted there for her, before leaving for the war. The next morning, Al is furious and breaks his relationship with Maria. Ivan's goal is fulfilled and he marries Maria in an orthodox ceremony, but his dream of a happiness shared with Maria is soon broken. Having adored Maria for so long from afar, now that they are together, Ivan is unable to consummate their marriage, disturbing their happiness.\n\nMaria works as a nurse and would like to have children. Deeply in love with Ivan, she has to deal with her increasing sexual frustration. On the advice of Clarence, a drifter singer passing by the town, Ivan reaffirms his sense of manliness with Mrs Wynic, with whom he is not impotent. Maria discovers Ivan's infidelity, and a terrible argument ensues between them. Al invites the couple to his engagement party to Maria's girlfriend. In the middle of this gathering, Al breaks off his engagement, realizing that he is still in love with Maria. Al and Ivan have a confrontation. Ivan offers to let Al have Maria, but to demonstrate his own love for Maria, he puts his hand in a burning stove. Maria, very much in love with Ivan, tells Al that she does not love him.\n\nMaria heals Ivan's hand, but the unhappiness between them increases further. She is pursued by Clarence who tries to seduce her, but she remains faithful to Ivan and resists Clarence's advances. One day, unexpectedly, Ivan leaves town by train. Moving to a new city, he starts work in a slaughter house, making new friends. \n\nLeft to her own devices, Maria finally succumbs to Clarence's advances. Though she quickly rejects him, she is pregnant. Maria searches out Ivan and tells him of her pregnancy and of the death of her grandmother, but Ivan is now cruelly indifferent towards her.\n\nOut with his friends one night, Ivan meets up with Clarence. Clarence does not remember him and tells the story of how he seduced Maria, and that she later refused to have anything further to do with him. Furious, Ivan hits a still incredulous Clarence.\n\nIvan, still tormented by nightmares of his war experiences, is visited by his father, who tells Ivan that he is dying and that he must come back to Maria.

The plot follows a soldier returning from World War II who marries the woman of his dreams, but he is unable to consummate his marriage, ruining the couple's chances of a shared happiness.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the spring of 1946, Ivan, an American soldier, returns home psychologically scarred after spending some time in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. Once back in his small Pennsylvania town, Ivan settles in, trying to put his life back together while living with his stoic peasant father.\n\nShortly after his arrival, Ivan looks for his childhood sweetheart, Maria, a beautiful woman who is taking care of her old deaf grandmother. However, he is disappointed to find Maria in the arms of Al, a captain. Ivan's father thinks that Maria is too good for his son, but perhaps good enough for himself. He pairs his son with Mrs Wynic, a flirty neighbor. Ivan has sex with her, but he is tormented by the traumas of the war. He tells her that it was his dreams about Maria that allowed him to survive the prison camp.\n\nIvan is given a hero's welcoming by his community, formed by immigrants from Yugoslavia. During the celebrations, when Al goes to dance with one of Maria's friends, Ivan grabs the opportunity to get close to her. Together they leave the party on his motorbike, heading for their favorite spot of years ago. He gives her a pair of earrings that he planted there for her, before leaving for the war. The next morning, Al is furious and breaks his relationship with Maria. Ivan's goal is fulfilled and he marries Maria in an orthodox ceremony, but his dream of a happiness shared with Maria is soon broken. Having adored Maria for so long from afar, now that they are together, Ivan is unable to consummate their marriage, disturbing their happiness.\n\nMaria works as a nurse and would like to have children. Deeply in love with Ivan, she has to deal with her increasing sexual frustration. On the advice of Clarence, a drifter singer passing by the town, Ivan reaffirms his sense of manliness with Mrs Wynic, with whom he is not impotent. Maria discovers Ivan's infidelity, and a terrible argument ensues between them. Al invites the couple to his engagement party to Maria's girlfriend. In the middle of this gathering, Al breaks off his engagement, realizing that he is still in love with Maria. Al and Ivan have a confrontation. Ivan offers to let Al have Maria, but to demonstrate his own love for Maria, he puts his hand in a burning stove. Maria, very much in love with Ivan, tells Al that she does not love him.\n\nMaria heals Ivan's hand, but the unhappiness between them increases further. She is pursued by Clarence who tries to seduce her, but she remains faithful to Ivan and resists Clarence's advances. One day, unexpectedly, Ivan leaves town by train. Moving to a new city, he starts work in a slaughter house, making new friends. \n\nLeft to her own devices, Maria finally succumbs to Clarence's advances. Though she quickly rejects him, she is pregnant. Maria searches out Ivan and tells him of her pregnancy and of the death of her grandmother, but Ivan is now cruelly indifferent towards her.\n\nOut with his friends one night, Ivan meets up with Clarence. Clarence does not remember him and tells the story of how he seduced Maria, and that she later refused to have anything further to do with him. Furious, Ivan hits a still incredulous Clarence.\n\nIvan, still tormented by nightmares of his war experiences, is visited by his father, who tells Ivan that he is dying and that he must come back to Maria. Ivan returns home, admitting to Maria that he loves her baby. Now that Maria's chaste image has vanished, she and Ivan are able to make love for the first time.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Nastassja Kinski]] - Maria\n*[[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] - Ivan\n*[[Robert Mitchum]] \u2013 Ivan\u2019s father\n*[[Keith Carradine]] - Clarence\n*[[Anita Morris]] \u2013 Mrs. Wynic\n*[[Bud Cort]] - Harvey\n*[[Vincent Spano]] - Al Griselli\n*[[Karen Young (actress)|Karen Young]] - Rosie\n*[[John Goodman]] - Frank\n\n==DVD release==\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] in the [[United States]] in December 2001.\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb title|id= 0087682|title=Maria's Lovers}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|marias_lovers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marias Lovers}}\n\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:1980s drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Serbian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andrei Konchalovsky]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria%27s_Lovers"}

The term may refer to acquired conditions such as [[cerebral achromatopsia]], but it typically refers to an [[autosomal recessive]] congenital [[color blindness|color vision condition]], the inability to perceive [[color]] and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels, typically exterior daylight. The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. It is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000&nbsp;live births worldwide.\n\nThere is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'' by [[Oliver Sacks]], some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.\n\nOne common trait is [[hemeralopia]] or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the [[cone cell|cone system]] and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nThe syndrome is frequently noticed first in children around six months of age by their photophobic activity or their [[nystagmus]]. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life&nbsp;\u2013 but remain near 20/200. The congenital forms of the condition are considered stationary and do not worsen with age.\n\nThe five symptoms associated with achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia are:\n# Achromatopsia\n# [[Amblyopia]] \u2013 reduced visual acuity\n# [[Hemeralopia]] \u2013 with the subject exhibiting photophobia\n# [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]]\n# [[Iris (anatomy)|Iris]] operating abnormalities\n\nThe syndrome of achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is poorly described in current medical and neuro-ophthalmological texts. It became a common term following the release of neuroscientist Oliver Sacks' book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'', in 1997. Up to that time most color blind subjects were described as achromats or achromatopes. Those with a lesser degree of color perception abnormality were described as either protanopes, deuteranopes or tetartanopes&nbsp;\u2013 historically tritanopes.\n\nAchromatopsia has also been called rod [[monochromacy]] and total congenital color blindness. Individuals with the [[congenital]] form of this condition show complete absence of [[cone cell]] activity via [[electroretinography]] at high light levels. There are at least four [[locus (genetics)|genetic causes]] of congenital achromatopsia, two of which involve [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s ([[#ACHM2|ACHM2]], [[#ACHM3|ACHM3]]), a third involves the cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.\n\n=== Complete achromatopsia ===\nAside from a complete inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia have a number of other [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] aberrations. Included among these [[optical aberration]]s are greatly decreased [[visual acuity]] (<0.1 or 20 in daylight, [[hemeralopia]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], and severe [[photophobia]]. The [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye appears completely normal.\n\n=== Incomplete achromatopsia ===\nIn general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia (dyschromatopsia) are similar to those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.\n\n== Cause ==\n\n=== Acquired ===\nAcquired achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is a condition associated with damage to the diencephalon\u2014primarily the [[thalamus]] of the mid brain\u2014or the [[cerebral cortex]]\u2014the new brain\u2014specifically the fourth visual association area, V4 which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in colour processing.\n\nThalamic achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is caused by damage to the thalamus; it is most frequently caused by tumor growth since the thalamus is well protected from external damage.\n\n[[Cerebral achromatopsia]] is a form of acquired [[color blindness]] that is caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth.\n\n=== Congenital ===\nThe known causes of the congenital forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the [[Photoreceptor cell#Phototransduction|retinal phototransduction pathway]]. Specifically, this form of achromatopsia seems to result from the inability of [[cone cell]]s to properly respond to light input by [[membrane potential|hyperpolarizing]]. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) as well as the cone cell [[transducin]], GNAT2 (ACHM4).\n\nA fourth genetic cause (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) was discovered in 2009.{{sfn|Thiadens|2009|pp=240\u2013247}} It is a mutation of gene PDE6C, located on chromosome locus&nbsp;10, 10q24. It is estimated that less than two percent of achromatopsias are caused by a mutation in this gene.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nThe hemeralopic aspect of achromatopsia can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately a hundred times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described, the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.\n\nIn general, the molecular pathomechanism of achromatopsia is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]; particularly important in [[visual perception]] as its level controls the opening of [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting [[membrane potential|hyperpolarization]] and cessation of [[glutamate]] [[Chemical synapse#Signaling across chemical synapses|release]].\n\nNative retinal CNGs are composed of 2&nbsp;\u03b1- and 2&nbsp;\u03b2-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in [[cone cell]]s. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas this is not the case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability ([[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] vs. [[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] and [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward [[Image rectification|rectification]], current flickering, and sensitivity to block by [[diltiazem|L-cis-diltiazem]].\n\nMutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function\u2014often increased affinity for cGMP\u2014of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the [[cone cell]] [[transducin]], GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by [[photon]]s. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia [[phenotype]].\n\nMolecular diagnosis can be established by identification of biallelic variants in the causative genes. Molecular genetic testing approaches used in achromatopsia can include targeted analysis for the common CNGB3 variant c.1148delC&nbsp;(p.Thr383IlefsTer13), use of a multigenerational panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n=== ACHM2 ===\nWhile some mutations in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, at least one mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate]]. Others include the introduction of a sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased [[calcium]] permeability.\n\nWhen mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}} While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to achromatopsia, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1&nbsp;region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface.{{sfn|Patel|2005|pp=2282\u20132290}} Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the [[cone cell]]'s ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1&nbsp;region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}}\n\n=== ACHM3 ===\nWhile very few mutations in CNGB3 have been characterized, the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional. This will largely result in [[haploinsufficiency]], though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a [[dominant negative]] fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the [[cell membrane]].{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}}\n\nThe three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q&nbsp;mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity.{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP.{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.\n\n=== ACHM4 ===\nUpon activation by light, [[cone opsin]] causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein ([[G-protein]]) \u03b1-[[transducin]]g activity polypeptide&nbsp;2 (GNAT2). This causes the release of the activated \u03b1-subunit from the inhibitory \u03b2/\u03b3-subunits. This \u03b1-subunit then activates a [[phosphodiesterase]] that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3&nbsp;channels.\n\nAs this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, cone opsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptor]] [[membrane potential|membrane hyperpolarization]].\n\n== Management ==\nThere is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia. However, dark red or plum colored filters are very helpful in controlling light sensitivity.{{sfn|Corn|2010|p=233}}\n\nSince 2003, there is a cybernetic device called [[eyeborg]] that allows people to perceive color through sound waves.{{sfn|Ronchi|2009|p=319}} Achromatopsic artist [[Neil Harbisson]] was the first to use such a device in early 2004, the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound of each color.{{sfn|Pearlman|2015|pp=84\u201390}}\n\nMoreover, there is some research on gene therapy for animals with achromatopsia, with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting [[gene therapy for color blindness]] on humans.\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAchromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1&nbsp;in 30,000 people.{{sfn|Thiadens|2011|p=59}}\n\nHowever, on the small [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]n atoll of [[Pingelap]], approximately five percent of the atoll's 3,000 inhabitants are afflicted.{{sfn|Brody|1970|pp=1253\u20131257}}{{sfn|Hussels|1972|pp=304\u2013309}} This is the result of a [[population bottleneck]] caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia.\n\nThe people of this region have termed achromatopsia \"maskun\", which literally means \"not see\" in [[Pingelapese]].{{sfn|Morton|1972|pp=277\u2013289}} This unusual population drew neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]''.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{term|Acquired achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|[[Cerebral achromatopsia]]}}\n{{term|Congenital or inherited achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=1|Complete typical achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=2|Incomplete atypical achromatopsia, or incomplete atypical [[Color blindness|dyschromatopsia]]}}\n\n=== Related ===\n{{term|Achromatopsia}}\n  {{defn|Complete lack of the perception of color in a subject, seeing only in black, white, and shades of grey.

The term may refer to acquired conditions such as [[cerebral achromatopsia]], but it typically refers to an [[autosomal recessive]] congenital [[color blindness|color vision condition]], the inability to perceive [[color]] and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels, typically exterior daylight. The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. It is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000&nbsp;live births worldwide.\n\nThere is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'' by [[Oliver Sacks]], some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.\n\nOne common trait is [[hemeralopia]] or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the [[cone cell|cone system]] and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nThe syndrome is frequently noticed first in children around six months of age by their photophobic activity or their [[nystagmus]]. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life&nbsp;\u2013 but remain near 20/200. The congenital forms of the condition are considered stationary and do not worsen with age.\n\nThe five symptoms associated with achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia are:\n# Achromatopsia\n# [[Amblyopia]] \u2013 reduced visual acuity\n# [[Hemeralopia]] \u2013 with the subject exhibiting photophobia\n# [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]]\n# [[Iris (anatomy)|Iris]] operating abnormalities\n\nThe syndrome of achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is poorly described in current medical and neuro-ophthalmological texts. It became a common term following the release of neuroscientist Oliver Sacks' book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'', in 1997. Up to that time most color blind subjects were described as achromats or achromatopes. Those with a lesser degree of color perception abnormality were described as either protanopes, deuteranopes or tetartanopes&nbsp;\u2013 historically tritanopes.\n\nAchromatopsia has also been called rod [[monochromacy]] and total congenital color blindness. Individuals with the [[congenital]] form of this condition show complete absence of [[cone cell]] activity via [[electroretinography]] at high light levels. There are at least four [[locus (genetics)|genetic causes]] of congenital achromatopsia, two of which involve [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s ([[#ACHM2|ACHM2]], [[#ACHM3|ACHM3]]), a third involves the cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.\n\n=== Complete achromatopsia ===\nAside from a complete inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia have a number of other [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] aberrations. Included among these [[optical aberration]]s are greatly decreased [[visual acuity]] (<0.1 or 20 in daylight, [[hemeralopia]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], and severe [[photophobia]]. The [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye appears completely normal.\n\n=== Incomplete achromatopsia ===\nIn general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia (dyschromatopsia) are similar to those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.\n\n== Cause ==\n\n=== Acquired ===\nAcquired achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is a condition associated with damage to the diencephalon\u2014primarily the [[thalamus]] of the mid brain\u2014or the [[cerebral cortex]]\u2014the new brain\u2014specifically the fourth visual association area, V4 which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in colour processing.\n\nThalamic achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is caused by damage to the thalamus; it is most frequently caused by tumor growth since the thalamus is well protected from external damage.\n\n[[Cerebral achromatopsia]] is a form of acquired [[color blindness]] that is caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth.\n\n=== Congenital ===\nThe known causes of the congenital forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the [[Photoreceptor cell#Phototransduction|retinal phototransduction pathway]]. Specifically, this form of achromatopsia seems to result from the inability of [[cone cell]]s to properly respond to light input by [[membrane potential|hyperpolarizing]]. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) as well as the cone cell [[transducin]], GNAT2 (ACHM4).\n\nA fourth genetic cause (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) was discovered in 2009.{{sfn|Thiadens|2009|pp=240\u2013247}} It is a mutation of gene PDE6C, located on chromosome locus&nbsp;10, 10q24. It is estimated that less than two percent of achromatopsias are caused by a mutation in this gene.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nThe hemeralopic aspect of achromatopsia can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately a hundred times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described, the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.\n\nIn general, the molecular pathomechanism of achromatopsia is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]; particularly important in [[visual perception]] as its level controls the opening of [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting [[membrane potential|hyperpolarization]] and cessation of [[glutamate]] [[Chemical synapse#Signaling across chemical synapses|release]].\n\nNative retinal CNGs are composed of 2&nbsp;\u03b1- and 2&nbsp;\u03b2-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in [[cone cell]]s. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas this is not the case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability ([[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] vs. [[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] and [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward [[Image rectification|rectification]], current flickering, and sensitivity to block by [[diltiazem|L-cis-diltiazem]].\n\nMutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function\u2014often increased affinity for cGMP\u2014of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the [[cone cell]] [[transducin]], GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by [[photon]]s. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia [[phenotype]].\n\nMolecular diagnosis can be established by identification of biallelic variants in the causative genes. Molecular genetic testing approaches used in achromatopsia can include targeted analysis for the common CNGB3 variant c.1148delC&nbsp;(p.Thr383IlefsTer13), use of a multigenerational panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n=== ACHM2 ===\nWhile some mutations in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, at least one mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate]]. Others include the introduction of a sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased [[calcium]] permeability.\n\nWhen mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}} While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to achromatopsia, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1&nbsp;region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface.{{sfn|Patel|2005|pp=2282\u20132290}} Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the [[cone cell]]'s ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1&nbsp;region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}}\n\n=== ACHM3 ===\nWhile very few mutations in CNGB3 have been characterized, the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional. This will largely result in [[haploinsufficiency]], though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a [[dominant negative]] fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the [[cell membrane]].{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}}\n\nThe three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q&nbsp;mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity.{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP.{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.\n\n=== ACHM4 ===\nUpon activation by light, [[cone opsin]] causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein ([[G-protein]]) \u03b1-[[transducin]]g activity polypeptide&nbsp;2 (GNAT2). This causes the release of the activated \u03b1-subunit from the inhibitory \u03b2/\u03b3-subunits. This \u03b1-subunit then activates a [[phosphodiesterase]] that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3&nbsp;channels.\n\nAs this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, cone opsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptor]] [[membrane potential|membrane hyperpolarization]].\n\n== Management ==\nThere is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia. However, dark red or plum colored filters are very helpful in controlling light sensitivity.{{sfn|Corn|2010|p=233}}\n\nSince 2003, there is a cybernetic device called [[eyeborg]] that allows people to perceive color through sound waves.{{sfn|Ronchi|2009|p=319}} Achromatopsic artist [[Neil Harbisson]] was the first to use such a device in early 2004, the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound of each color.{{sfn|Pearlman|2015|pp=84\u201390}}\n\nMoreover, there is some research on gene therapy for animals with achromatopsia, with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting [[gene therapy for color blindness]] on humans.\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAchromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1&nbsp;in 30,000 people.{{sfn|Thiadens|2011|p=59}}\n\nHowever, on the small [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]n atoll of [[Pingelap]], approximately five percent of the atoll's 3,000 inhabitants are afflicted.{{sfn|Brody|1970|pp=1253\u20131257}}{{sfn|Hussels|1972|pp=304\u2013309}} This is the result of a [[population bottleneck]] caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia.\n\nThe people of this region have termed achromatopsia \"maskun\", which literally means \"not see\" in [[Pingelapese]].{{sfn|Morton|1972|pp=277\u2013289}} This unusual population drew neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]''.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{term|Acquired achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|[[Cerebral achromatopsia]]}}\n{{term|Congenital or inherited achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=1|Complete typical achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=2|Incomplete atypical achromatopsia, or incomplete atypical [[Color blindness|dyschromatopsia]]}}\n\n=== Related ===\n{{term|Achromatopsia}}\n  {{defn|Complete lack of the perception of color in a subject, seeing only in black, white, and shades of grey.

{"title_page": "Piano Trio (Tchaikovsky)", "text_new": "[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s '''Trio in A minor''', Op. 50, was written in [[Rome]] between December 1881 and late January 1882. It is subtitled \u00ab \u00c0 la m\u00e9moire d\u2019un grand artiste \u00bb - ''In memory of a great artist,'' in reference to [[Nikolai Rubinstein]], his close friend and mentor, who had died on 23 March 1881.  It is scored for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]].\n\nThe work's first version was completed by late January 1882.<ref name=rad/>  Private performances were held in March and April. The work underwent considerable revision<ref name=net/> before its premiere on 30 October at a quartet concert of the Russian Musical Society in [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FugueMasters Program Notes|author=Joseph Way|url=http://www.fuguemasters.com/tchaikovsky.htm|accessdate=2007-09-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227190031/http://www.fuguemasters.com/tchaikovsky.htm|archivedate=2007-12-27}}</ref> The players at the performance were [[Sergei Taneyev]] (piano), [[Jan H\u0159\u00edmal\u00fd]] (violin), and [[Wilhelm Fitzenhagen]] (cello).<ref name=net/>\n\n==Movements==\nThe piece is marked by a tragic perspective and is in two [[movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n:I. Pezzo elegiaco (Moderato assai&nbsp;\u2013 Allegro giusto) (in [[A minor]]) (approx 20:00)\n:II. (A) Tema con variazioni: Andante con moto (in [[E major]]) \u2013 (B) Variazione finale e coda (in [[A major]] \u2013 A minor) (approx 27:00)\nTotal timing: approx. 47:00\n\nThe variations are as follows:\n:Var I\n:Var II: Pi\u00f9 mosso\n:Var III: Allegro moderato\n:Var IV: L'istesso tempo (Allegro moderato)\n:Var V: L'istesso tempo\n:Var VI: Tempo di Valse\n:Var VII: Allegro moderato\n:Var VIII: Fuga (Allegro moderato)\n:Var IX: Andante flebile, ma non tanto\n:Var X: Tempo di mazurka\n:Var XI: Moderato\n:Variazioni finale e coda: Allegro risoluto e con fuoco\n:Coda: Andante con moto&nbsp;\u2013 Lugubre (L'istesso tempo)\n\nThe ''Pezzo elegiaco'' is a darkly brooding and rather conventional romantic first movement with a beautiful opening cello solo with a theme that returns for a final funeral march.\n\nThe second movement is rather more unusual: it opens with an almost classical melody, much like Tchaikovsky's ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' for [[cello]], and then proceeds with an assured set of variations, also like the ''Rococo Variations''. After working itself into more and more ecstatic heights culminating with the final variation, it suddenly goes through a surprising modulation to the original [[minor scale|minor key]], and the theme from the first movement returns with an even greater gravity, and the entire piece concludes with yet another death march.\n\nThe work, and the second movement in particular, is arguably the most difficult piece Tchaikovsky wrote for piano, whether solo, with orchestra, or in a chamber group. It remains popular, despite its length (it plays for more than 45 minutes), for its breathtaking lyricism and the cosmic finality of its final statement.{{citation needed}}\n\n==Background==\nThis was the only work Tchaikovsky ever wrote for the combination of [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]].  In 1880, his benefactress [[Nadezhda von Meck]], had asked for such a piece, but he refused, saying in his letter to her of 5&nbsp;November 1880:\n:''You ask why I have never written a trio.  Forgive me, dear friend; I would do anything to give you pleasure, but this is beyond me ... I simply cannot endure the combination of piano with violin or cello.  To my mind the timbre of these instruments will not blend ... it is torture for me to have to listen to a string trio or a sonata of any kind for piano and strings.

It is scored for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]].\n\nThe work's first version was completed by late January 1882.<ref name=rad/>  Private performances were held in March and April. The work underwent considerable revision<ref name=net/> before its premiere on 30 October at a quartet concert of the Russian Musical Society in [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FugueMasters Program Notes|author=Joseph Way|url=http://www.fuguemasters.com/tchaikovsky.htm|accessdate=2007-09-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227190031/http://www.fuguemasters.com/tchaikovsky.htm|archivedate=2007-12-27}}</ref> The players at the performance were [[Sergei Taneyev]] (piano), [[Jan H\u0159\u00edmal\u00fd]] (violin), and [[Wilhelm Fitzenhagen]] (cello).<ref name=net/>\n\n==Movements==\nThe piece is marked by a tragic perspective and is in two [[movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n:I. Pezzo elegiaco (Moderato assai&nbsp;\u2013 Allegro giusto) (in [[A minor]]) (approx 20:00)\n:II. (A) Tema con variazioni: Andante con moto (in [[E major]]) \u2013 (B) Variazione finale e coda (in [[A major]] \u2013 A minor) (approx 27:00)\nTotal timing: approx. 47:00\n\nThe variations are as follows:\n:Var I\n:Var II: Pi\u00f9 mosso\n:Var III: Allegro moderato\n:Var IV: L'istesso tempo (Allegro moderato)\n:Var V: L'istesso tempo\n:Var VI: Tempo di Valse\n:Var VII: Allegro moderato\n:Var VIII: Fuga (Allegro moderato)\n:Var IX: Andante flebile, ma non tanto\n:Var X: Tempo di mazurka\n:Var XI: Moderato\n:Variazioni finale e coda: Allegro risoluto e con fuoco\n:Coda: Andante con moto&nbsp;\u2013 Lugubre (L'istesso tempo)\n\nThe ''Pezzo elegiaco'' is a darkly brooding and rather conventional romantic first movement with a beautiful opening cello solo with a theme that returns for a final funeral march.\n\nThe second movement is rather more unusual: it opens with an almost classical melody, much like Tchaikovsky's ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' for [[cello]], and then proceeds with an assured set of variations, also like the ''Rococo Variations''. After working itself into more and more ecstatic heights culminating with the final variation, it suddenly goes through a surprising modulation to the original [[minor scale|minor key]], and the theme from the first movement returns with an even greater gravity, and the entire piece concludes with yet another death march.\n\nThe work, and the second movement in particular, is arguably the most difficult piece Tchaikovsky wrote for piano, whether solo, with orchestra, or in a chamber group. It remains popular, despite its length (it plays for more than 45 minutes), for its breathtaking lyricism and the cosmic finality of its final statement.\n\n==Background==\nThis was the only work Tchaikovsky ever wrote for the combination of [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]].  In 1880, his benefactress [[Nadezhda von Meck]], had asked for such a piece, but he refused, saying in his letter to her of 5&nbsp;November 1880:\n:''You ask why I have never written a trio.  Forgive me, dear friend; I would do anything to give you pleasure, but this is beyond me ... I simply cannot endure the combination of piano with violin or cello.  To my mind the timbre of these instruments will not blend ... it is torture for me to have to listen to a string trio or a sonata of any kind for piano and strings.  To my mind, the piano can be effective in only three situations: alone, in context with the orchestra, or as accompaniment, i.e., the background of a picture''.<ref name=rad>Quoted in Mark A.

The severity of the symptoms a female fetus undergoes depends on when the exposure occurs and the duration of the exposure. If a female fetus is exposed to increased levels of testosterone in the first 7\u201312 weeks of the pregnancy, [[Progestin-induced virilisation|labioscrotal fusion]] and clitoromegaly can occur. These conditions would need correctional surgery if the infant was to be raised female. If testosterone exposure occurs after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, no fusion will occur but the clitoris could still be enlarged.<ref name=\"three\"/> The enlarged clitoris usually corrects itself after birth and the abnormally high testosterone levels will decrease as the body produces its own hormones.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==Risk factors==\n\nSeveral conditions predispose a woman to forming a luteoma during pregnancy. [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] is one such condition.<ref name=\"five\"/> This syndrome is associated with high hormone levels and the failure of the ovaries to release an egg during the [[menstrual cycle]], a symptom more often associated with [[menopause]]. The high levels of hormones in polycystic ovary syndrome seem to predispose women to forming a luteoma during pregnancy. A characteristic of luteomas is that they grow better in the presence of high levels of hormones that function in normal growth, sexual development, and reproductive function. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome causes an excess of hormones in the body including some of the hormones related to these functions.<ref name=\"ten\">{{cite journal |last=Carmina |first=Enrico |last2=Lobo |first2=Rogerio |date=1999 |title=Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):Arguably the most common endocrinopathy is associated with significant morbidity in women |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |publisher=The Endocrine Society |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=1897\u20131899 |doi=10.1210/jc.84.6.1897}}</ref> Women who have already had a luteoma during a previous pregnancy have a higher high risk of having another luteoma. In this situation,  women can be counseled on the risks of another pregnancy and their alternatives.  Other risk factors associated with luteomas are multiple pregnancies, advanced maternal age, and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity.<ref name=\"five\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nLuteomas are not often detected before delivery. Most luteomas are found during surgery if a [[caesarean section]] is performed or when some other surgery is performed. Pre-delivery detection is not effective for many reasons. Some tests, that can be performed pre-delivery, measure the amount of testosterone in the blood; however, this is not a very useful detection method since normal pregnancies have increased amounts of testosterone. Another method that would be useful to determine if a fetus is being exposed to testosterone is to test the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]] for testosterone. The placenta has a mechanism for converting hormones from the mother into hormones that the fetus needs. If the amount of testosterone in the umbilical cord is higher than normal, the [[gene]] type of the fetus should be determined to see if the fetus is male or female. If the fetus is female then the high levels of testosterone in the umbilical cord could be an indicator that a luteoma is present. Unfortunately, this procedure can't be safely performed until after the fetus has undergone [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] (when the sex of the fetus becomes apparent). But by this time the damage has already been done.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\n\nNo treatments for luteomas are currently available. The luteomas can be detected through [[ultrasound]] if masculinization is apparent in the mother.<ref name=\"seven\"/> The fetus can be tested for gene type and if the fetus is female and the umbilical cord tests high for testosterone levels then the risks of masculinization of the fetus can be considered. Interventions can't be made to change the outcomes, but the potential risks can be analyzed in order to make preparations. After the fetus is delivered the luteoma regresses on its own and only monitoring of the mother is needed after delivery. Depending on the sex of the fetus, exposure time and duration, the parents may need to decide if they will raise the child as male or female. Surgery may be necessary depending on what sex the child is going to be raised.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = C56.9\n| ICD9            = \n| ICDO            = 8610/0\n| OMIM            = \n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = D018311\n| SNOMED CT       = 26372004\n}}\n* [https://archive.is/20121215024933/http://esynopsis.uchc.edu/eAtlas/GYN/1323.htm Histology at esynopsis.uchc.edu]\n\n{{Gonadal tumors, paraganglioma, glomus, nevi and melanomas}}\n{{Breast cancer/urogenital neoplasia}}\n\n<!-- retained ancestor category (for benign cases) -->\n<!-- retained ancestor category (for benign cases) -->\n\n[[Category:Ovarian cancer]]\n[[Category:Intersex and medicine]]\n[[Category:Human pregnancy]]\n[[Category:Women's health]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Benign ovarian tumor}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Luteoma\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = Luteoma-of-pregnancy.jpg\n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = [[Obstetrics]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\nA '''luteoma''' is a tumor that occurs in the [[ovaries]] during pregnancy.\nIt is associated with an increase of sex [[hormones]], primarily [[progesterone]] and [[testosterone]].<ref name=\"one\">{{cite journal |last=Huhtaniemi |first=Ilpo |last2=Rulli |first2=Susana |last3=Ahtiainen |first3=Petteri |last4=Poutanen |first4=Matti |date=2005 |title=Multiple sites of tumorigenesis in transgenic mice overproducing hCG |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |publisher=Elsevier Ireland Ltd. |volume=234 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=117\u2013126 |doi= 10.1016/j.mce.2004.10.013 |pmid=15836960}}</ref><ref name=\"two\">{{cite journal |last=Sorianello |first=E |last2=Fritz |first2=S |last3=Beyer |first3=S |last4=Hales |first4=D B |last5=Mayerhofer |first5=A |last6=Libertun |first6=C |last7=Lux-Lantos |first7=V |date=2002 |title=Development of an experimental ovarian tumor: immunocytochemical analysis |journal=European Journal of Endocrinology | publisher=[[Bioscientifica]]|volume= 147 |pages=387\u2013395 |doi=10.1530/eje.0.1470387}}</ref> The size of the tumor can range from 1 to 25&nbsp;cm in diameter, but is usually 6 to 10&nbsp;cm in diameter<ref name=\"three\">{{cite book |last=McClamrock |first=Howard |title= Contemporary Endocrinology: Androgen Excess Disorders in Women: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Other Disorders, Second Edition |publisher=Humana Press Inc. }}</ref> and can grow throughout the duration of the pregnancy.<ref name=\"four\">{{cite journal |last=Greene |first=R |last2=Holzwarth |first2=David |last3=Roddick |first3=J |date=1964 |title=Luteomas of Pregnancy |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=1001\u20131011 | pmid = 14139281 |doi=10.1016/s0002-9378(16)35084-0}}</ref> However, luteomas are [[benign tumor|benign]] and resolve themselves after delivery.

During a normal pregnancy, the testosterone level will increase slightly in the first and second [[pregnancy|trimester]], but doubles in the third trimester.

However, after birth, the male fetus may have abnormally high levels of testosterone, but this resolves itself. There hasn't been any ties between luteomas and the male infant producing high amounts of testosterone by itself.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\nOut of the 36% of women who show male characteristics from the luteoma, 75% of female fetuses will also show signs of masculinization.<ref name=\"three\"/> Female fetuses can have a variety of symptoms ranging from severe, requiring surgery, to mild, which resolves itself after birth. The severity of the symptoms a female fetus undergoes depends on when the exposure occurs and the duration of the exposure. If a female fetus is exposed to increased levels of testosterone in the first 7\u201312 weeks of the pregnancy, [[Progestin-induced virilisation|labioscrotal fusion]] and clitoromegaly can occur. These conditions would need correctional surgery if the infant was to be raised female. If testosterone exposure occurs after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, no fusion will occur but the clitoris could still be enlarged.<ref name=\"three\"/> The enlarged clitoris usually corrects itself after birth and the abnormally high testosterone levels will decrease as the body produces its own hormones.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==Risk factors==\n\nSeveral conditions predispose a woman to forming a luteoma during pregnancy. [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] is one such condition.<ref name=\"five\"/> This syndrome is associated with high hormone levels and the failure of the ovaries to release an egg during the [[menstrual cycle]], a symptom more often associated with [[menopause]]. The high levels of hormones in polycystic ovary syndrome seem to predispose women to forming a luteoma during pregnancy. A characteristic of luteomas is that they grow better in the presence of high levels of hormones that function in normal growth, sexual development, and reproductive function. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome causes an excess of hormones in the body including some of the hormones related to these functions.<ref name=\"ten\">{{cite journal |last=Carmina |first=Enrico |last2=Lobo |first2=Rogerio |date=1999 |title=Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):Arguably the most common endocrinopathy is associated with significant morbidity in women |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |publisher=The Endocrine Society |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=1897\u20131899 |doi=10.1210/jc.84.6.1897}}</ref> Women who have already had a luteoma during a previous pregnancy have a higher high risk of having another luteoma. In this situation,  women can be counseled on the risks of another pregnancy and their alternatives.  Other risk factors associated with luteomas are multiple pregnancies, advanced maternal age, and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity.<ref name=\"five\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nLuteomas are not often detected before delivery. Most luteomas are found during surgery if a [[caesarean section]] is performed or when some other surgery is performed. Pre-delivery detection is not effective for many reasons. Some tests, that can be performed pre-delivery, measure the amount of testosterone in the blood; however, this is not a very useful detection method since normal pregnancies have increased amounts of testosterone. Another method that would be useful to determine if a fetus is being exposed to testosterone is to test the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]] for testosterone. The placenta has a mechanism for converting hormones from the mother into hormones that the fetus needs. If the amount of testosterone in the umbilical cord is higher than normal, the [[gene]] type of the fetus should be determined to see if the fetus is male or female. If the fetus is female then the high levels of testosterone in the umbilical cord could be an indicator that a luteoma is present. Unfortunately, this procedure can't be safely performed until after the fetus has undergone [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] (when the sex of the fetus becomes apparent). But by this time the damage has already been done.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\n\nNo treatments for luteomas are currently available. The luteomas can be detected through [[ultrasound]] if masculinization is apparent in the mother.<ref name=\"seven\"/> The fetus can be tested for gene type and if the fetus is female and the umbilical cord tests high for testosterone levels then the risks of masculinization of the fetus can be considered. Interventions can't be made to change the outcomes, but the potential risks can be analyzed in order to make preparations. After the fetus is delivered the luteoma regresses on its own and only monitoring of the mother is needed after delivery. Depending on the sex of the fetus, exposure time and duration, the parents may need to decide if they will raise the child as male or female. Surgery may be necessary depending on what sex the child is going to be raised.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     =  \n|  ICD10          = C56.9 \n|  ICD9           =  \n|  ICDO           = 8610/0 \n|  OMIM           =  \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = D018311\n}}\n* [https://archive.is/20121215024933/http://esynopsis.uchc.edu/eAtlas/GYN/1323.htm Histology at esynopsis.uchc.edu]\n\n{{Gonadal tumors, paraganglioma, glomus, nevi and melanomas}}\n{{Breast cancer/urogenital neoplasia}}\n\n<!-- retained ancestor category (for benign cases) -->\n<!-- retained ancestor category (for benign cases) -->\n\n[[Category:Ovarian cancer]]\n[[Category:Intersex and medicine]]\n[[Category:Human pregnancy]]\n[[Category:Women's health]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteoma"}
