In 2015, Homestead High School placed first nationally<ref>http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/05/prweb12736000.htm</ref> in the David Ricardo division of the National Economics Challenge.\n\n===The Epitaph===\nHomestead's award-winning student newspaper, ''The Epitaph'', won eight Gold Crowns from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s from the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] (CSPA). During that same period, it received eight [[National Pacemaker Awards|Pacemaker Awards]] from the [[National Scholastic Press Association]]. As late as 1994, those were the most national awards ever given to a high school paper.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nIn 1988, the paper received one of its highest honors, The Press Freedom Award, from the [[Student Press Law Center]], for its successful defense of a story about a junior boy who was HIV positive, one of the first such stories in any high school newspaper. The story, which had been initially censored by the principal, was allowed to run when the newspaper invoked [[California Education Code 48907]], a California law that protects students' rights to free expression. The story was reported nationally in the wake of a Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood School District et al. v. Kuhlmeier et al.]]'', 484 U.S. 260 (1988) This case gave school officials greater latitude in determining the content of a school's official student publications. The California law made the ruling moot in the state.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring that same period, the paper also won numerous local and state awards. The [[San Jose Mercury News]] named the paper the best in its annual contest for Silicon Valley student newspapers ten of the twelve years the paper ran the contest. It was also awarded the top prize from the San Francisco Press Club several times during that period, as well as the top prize from the now-defunct Palo Alto Times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe paper's unusual name was selected by the school's first students in 1962. In keeping with the school's western theme and Mustang mascot, they named the paper after the first newspaper west of the Rockies, [[The Tombstone Epitaph|the Epitaph]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona]], which had been popularized in a television series of the time about [[Wyatt Earp]], \"[[Tombstone Territory]]\".{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome of the newspaper's former staffers have gone on to work in journalism professionally. Among them, Alex Williams (1983)  and Michael D. Shear (1986) write for [[The New York Times]], while Angela Chen (2009) writes for [[The Wall Street Journal]]. Erica Werner (1989) is a White House correspondent for the [[Associated Press]].{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe paper's adviser from 1976 to 1994, Nick Ferentinos, was the 1994 Dow Jones News Fund's National High School Journalism Teacher of the Year.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith a gift from alumnus [[Steve Wozniak]] (class of 1968), co-founder of Apple, The Epitaph adopted desktop publishing in 1986, among the first high school newspapers to use the technology to produce a student publication.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 2013, the Epitaph limited print distribution for financial reasons.

The Homestead Interact club is part of District 5170, which is the largest Interact district in the world. Homestead Interact stays in close relations with the district to provide students with volunteer and leadership opportunities that range from learning how to help and interact with local communities to making an impact internationally through causes that are chosen by the district. The interact club at Homestead is also closely connected with the interact clubs in the [[Fremont Union High School District]] and they work closely together to create ways to fundraise for the international projects through car washes, talent shows, dances, and more.\n\n===Mathematics competitions===\nMembers of the mathematics team have regularly qualified for the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] (AIME).

Beginning in the summer of 2009, solar panels and shade structures were added over both parking lots and the fields were reorganized so that a new stadium could be constructed.  The other half of campus, facing Homestead Road, consists of several school buildings. The majority of the buildings have an inner corridor with outdoor corridors connecting the buildings. Green-colored hoofmarks decorate Homestead High School's sidewalks and walkways, which are from the school's official mascot and color.

As late as 1994, those were the most national awards ever given to a high school paper.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nIn 1988, the paper received one of its highest honors, The Press Freedom Award, from the [[Student Press Law Center]], for its successful defense of a story about a junior boy who was HIV positive, one of the first such stories in any high school newspaper. The story, which had been initially censored by the principal, was allowed to run when the newspaper invoked [[California Education Code 48907]], a California law that protects students' rights to free expression. The story was reported nationally in the wake of a Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood School District et al. v. Kuhlmeier et al.]]'', 484 U.S. 260 (1988) This case gave school officials greater latitude in determining the content of a school's official student publications. The California law made the ruling moot in the state.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring that same period, the paper also won numerous local and state awards. The [[San Jose Mercury News]] named the paper the best in its annual contest for Silicon Valley student newspapers ten of the twelve years the paper ran the contest. It was also awarded the top prize from the San Francisco Press Club several times during that period, as well as the top prize from the now-defunct Palo Alto Times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe paper's unusual name was selected by the school's first students in 1962. In keeping with the school's western theme and Mustang mascot, they named the paper after the first newspaper west of the Rockies, [[The Tombstone Epitaph|the Epitaph]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona]], which had been popularized in a television series of the time about [[Wyatt Earp]], \"[[Tombstone Territory]]\".{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome of the newspaper's former staffers have gone on to work in journalism professionally. Among them, Alex Williams (1983)  and Michael D. Shear (1986) write for [[The New York Times]], while Angela Chen (2009) writes for [[The Wall Street Journal]]. Erica Werner (1989) is a White House correspondent for the [[Associated Press]].{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe paper's adviser from 1976 to 1994, Nick Ferentinos, was the 1994 Dow Jones News Fund's National High School Journalism Teacher of the Year.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith a gift from alumnus [[Steve Wozniak]] (class of 1968), co-founder of Apple, The Epitaph adopted desktop publishing in 1986, among the first high school newspapers to use the technology to produce a student publication.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 2013, the Epitaph limited print distribution for financial reasons.

The Homestead Interact club is part of District 5170, which is the largest Interact district in the world. Homestead Interact stays in close relations with the district to provide students with volunteer and leadership opportunities that range from learning how to help and interact with local communities to making an impact internationally through causes that are chosen by the district. The interact club at Homestead is also closely connected with the interact clubs in the [[Fremont Union High School District]] and they work closely together to create ways to fundraise for the international projects through car washes, talent shows, dances, and more.\n\n===Mathematics competitions===\nMembers of the mathematics team have regularly qualified for the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]] (AIME).
