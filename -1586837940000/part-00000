In early 1968 the U.S. Army\u2019s [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] moved to [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] to conduct [[Operation Jeb Stuart]] and to participate in [[Battle of Khe Sanh#Operation Pegasus|Operation Pegasus]], the relief of [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]]. On 27 January 1968 [[COMUSMACV]] General [[William Westmoreland]] ordered the establishment of a new [[MACV]]/ARVN headquarters (known as MACV Forward) at [[Phu Bai Combat Base]] to control the war in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province]]s. MACV Forward would be commanded by deputy COMUSMACV General [[Creighton Abrams]].

It was built in the early 17th century by the [[Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche|11th Baron Zouche]] of [[Harringworth]] but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]], which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I [[listed building]] in 1952.\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is notable for its decorative architecture, which includes at its centre a large [[oriel window]] above the principal entrance. Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen, an ornate drawing room, and a {{convert|126.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} gallery. Numerous columns and [[frieze]]s are found throughout the mansion, while several rooms have large [[tapestry|tapestries]] depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls. The house is set in {{convert|262|acre|ha}} of grounds containing an {{convert|18|acre|ha|adj=on}} lake. The grounds, which received a {{Not a typo|Grade&nbsp;II*}} listing in 1984, are part of a [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Registered Historic Park]] that includes about {{convert|10|ha|order=flip}} of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house. The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland.\n\nBramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century. The [[cricket]] ground at the house played host to a [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match in 1823 when an early [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] team played an [[All-England cricket teams|England&nbsp;XI]], and it hosted three other matches in 1825\u201326. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross [[maternity hospital|maternity home]], before becoming the residence of the exiled King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]] and [[Queen Anne of Romania]] for a number of years. It became the location of the [[Police Staff College, Bramshill|Police Staff College]] in 1960, and was later home to the [[European Police College]]. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to [[haunted house|haunt]] the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.\n\n==Location==\n{{Location map|Hampshire|lat_deg=51|lat_min=19|lat_sec=54|lat_dir=N|lon_deg=0|lon_min=54|lon_sec=32|lon_dir=W|position=left|background=#FFFFFF|label=Bramshill House|caption=Location of Bramshill House in Hampshire}}\nBramshill House is at the approximate centre of a triangle formed by [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Basingstoke]] and [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], about {{convert|47|mi}} by road southwest of central London.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps/index.php?view=51.34390,-0.93032&map=OSMap&zoom=7&layer=0|title=Ordnance Survey 1:50 000 Landranger Series of Great Britain|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]]|scale=1:50 000|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GM\"/> It lies to the northeast of [[Hartley Wintney]], east of [[Hazeley]] off the B3349 road, southeast of the village of [[Bramshill]], which lies on the B3011 road.\nThree main lanes approach the property: Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest, Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north, and the shorter Pheasantry Drive which approaches it from the southeast from Chalwin's Copse, just north of the course of the [[River Hart]].

It was built in the early 17th century by [[Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche|Baron Edward la Zouche]] of [[Harringworth]] but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]], which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I [[listed building]] in 1952.\n\nThe mansion's southern fa\u00e7ade is notable for its decorative architecture, which includes at its centre a large [[oriel window]] above the principal entrance. Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen, an ornate drawing room, and a {{convert|126.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} gallery. Numerous columns and [[frieze]]s are found throughout the mansion, while several rooms have large [[tapestry|tapestries]] depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls. The house is set in {{convert|262|acre|ha}} of grounds containing an {{convert|18|acre|ha|adj=on}} lake. The grounds, which received a {{Not a typo|Grade&nbsp;II*}} listing in 1984, are part of a [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Registered Historic Park]] that includes about {{convert|10|ha|order=flip}} of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house. The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland.\n\nBramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century. The [[cricket]] ground at the house played host to a [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match in 1823 when an early [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] team played an [[All-England cricket teams|England&nbsp;XI]], and it hosted three other matches in 1825\u201326. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross [[maternity hospital|maternity home]], before becoming the residence of the exiled King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael]] and [[Queen Anne of Romania]] for a number of years. It became the location of the [[Police Staff College, Bramshill|Police Staff College]] in 1960, and was later home to the [[European Police College]]. As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to [[haunted house|haunt]] the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.\n\n==Location==\n{{Location map|Hampshire|lat_deg=51|lat_min=19|lat_sec=54|lat_dir=N|lon_deg=0|lon_min=54|lon_sec=32|lon_dir=W|position=left|background=#FFFFFF|label=Bramshill House|caption=Location of Bramshill House in Hampshire}}\nBramshill House is at the approximate centre of a triangle formed by [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Basingstoke]] and [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], about {{convert|47|mi}} by road southwest of central London.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps/index.php?view=51.34390,-0.93032&map=OSMap&zoom=7&layer=0|title=Ordnance Survey 1:50 000 Landranger Series of Great Britain|publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]]|scale=1:50 000|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GM\"/> It lies to the northeast of [[Hartley Wintney]], east of [[Hazeley]] off the B3349 road, southeast of the village of [[Bramshill]], which lies on the B3011 road.\nThree main lanes approach the property: Mansion Drive from the B3011 in the southwest, Reading Drive South from the B3011 to the east of Bramshill village from the north, and the shorter Pheasantry Drive which approaches it from the southeast from Chalwin's Copse, just north of the course of the [[River Hart]].

It is located {{convert|25|km}} southeast of the city center and was opened in 1999, replacing the old Dayingshan Airport located along what is now the city's [[Guoxing Avenue]]. The airport is operated by [[Regal International Airport Group]].\n\nHaikou Meilan International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Hainan, the second busiest being [[Sanya Phoenix International Airport]]. In 2017, it was the 17th busiest airport in China (see [[List of the busiest airports in China]]).\n\n==Facilities==\nThe airport terminal has 60,200 square metres of space, with 45 check-in counters and 11 security checkpoints. The airport is staffed by 565 employees.\n\nA new, international terminal opened on August 14, 2013. Situated at the east side of the existing terminal, this new [[Airport apron|apron]] increases international capacity to ten flights, from the previous capacity of three. Construction of this new terminal began on April 18, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centreforaviation.com/news/haikou-meilan-international-airport-opens-international-terminal-255724 |title=Haikou Meilan International Airport opens international terminal &#124; CAPA |publisher=Centre for Aviation |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ttgasia.com/article.php?article_id=21516 |title=New terminal at Haikou airport opens - TTG Asia - Leader in Hotel, Airlines, Tourism and Travel Trade News |publisher=TTG Asia |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref>\n\n===Second phase===\nIn order to meet the increasing passenger flow demand, the second phase of the project was launched in 2016.\n\nThe newly built flight area of this project is located directly to the north, and parallel to the main part. It has a rating of 4F, and a new 3,600 (1,1811 feet) long runway, two parallel taxiways and contact road system are built. A total investment of 14.468 billion yuan will be made in the construction of a new T2 terminal covering 296,000 square meters and various types of platforms with 59 seats. The construction target of the project is to meet the annual passenger throughput of 35 million person-times and annual freight and postal throughput of 400,000 tons by 2025.\n\nThe project was scheduled to be basically completed in December 2018. The installation and commissioning of electro-mechanical equipment was scheduled to begin in 2019 and to be put into use at the end of that year.<ref>{{cite

Stiletto-style heels {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} or shorter are called [[kitten heel]]s.\n\nNot all high slim heels merit the description stiletto. The extremely slender classic Italian-style stiletto heels of the late 1950s and very early 1960s were no more than {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter for much of their length, although the heel sometimes flared out a little at the top-piece (tip). After their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were hard to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Shoe fetishism}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Stiefelwiki1e.jpg|190px|thumb|Stiletto heels can be found on almost every type of shoes, such as these ankle boots]]\n\nRelatively thin high heels were certainly around in the late 19th century, as numerous [[fetish art|fetish drawing]]s attest. Firm photographic evidence exists in the form of photographs of Parisian singer [[Mistinguett]] from the 1940s. These shoes were designed by [[Andre Perugia]], who began designing shoes in 1906. It seems unlikely that he invented the stiletto, but he is probably the first firmly-documented designer of the high, slim heel. The word stiletto applied to a heel is derived from a [[knife]] or [[dagger]] [[stiletto]], which is a long, thin blade, to which the heel of the shoe is similar in profile. Its usage in footwear first appeared in print in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1959: \"She came ...forward, her walk made lopsided by the absence of one heel of the stilettos\".<ref name=Games2007>{{Cite book|last = Games|first = Alex|year = 2007|title = Balderdash & Piffle: One Sandwich Short of a Dog's Dinner|isbn = 978-1-84607-235-2|publisher = BBC Books|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/balderdashpiffle0000game}}</ref>\n\nHigh-heel shoes were worn by men and women [[courtier]]s. The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. This revival of the opulent heel style can be attributed to the designer [[Roger Vivier]] and such designs became very popular in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|title= Italian Fashion: The History of High Heels|first= Meredith|last= Paslawsky|date= November 2008|publisher= Life In Italy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104328/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|archivedate= 22 December 2015|accessdate= 20 December 2012|quote= In 1954, Roger Vivier designed the first stiletto heel with its infamous bold arch for the house of Dior. \"Stiletto\" is an Italian word for a small metal dagger.}}</ref>\n\nAs time went on, stiletto heels would become known more for their erotic nature than for their ability to make height. Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels.

After their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were hard to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Shoe fetishism}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Stiefelwiki1e.jpg|190px|thumb|Stiletto heels can be found on almost every type of shoes, such as these ankle boots]]\n\nRelatively thin high heels were certainly around in the late 19th century, as numerous [[fetish art|fetish drawing]]s attest. Firm photographic evidence exists in the form of photographs of Parisian singer [[Mistinguett]] from the 1940s. These shoes were designed by [[Andre Perugia]], who began designing shoes in 1906. It seems unlikely that he invented the stiletto, but he is probably the first firmly-documented designer of the high, slim heel. The word stiletto applied to a heel is derived from a [[knife]] or [[dagger]] [[stiletto]], which is a long, thin blade, to which the heel of the shoe is similar in profile. Its usage in footwear first appeared in print in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 1959: \"She came ...forward, her walk made lopsided by the absence of one heel of the stilettos\".<ref name=Games2007>{{Cite book|last = Games|first = Alex|year = 2007|title = Balderdash & Piffle: One Sandwich Short of a Dog's Dinner|isbn = 978-1-84607-235-2|publisher = BBC Books|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/balderdashpiffle0000game}}</ref>\n\nHigh-heel shoes were worn by men and women [[courtier]]s. The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel, instead of wood or other, weaker materials that required a wide heel. This revival of the opulent heel style can be attributed to the designer [[Roger Vivier]] and such designs became very popular in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|title= Italian Fashion: The History of High Heels|first= Meredith|last= Paslawsky|date= November 2008|publisher= Life In Italy|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104328/http://www.lifeinitaly.com/fashion/high-heels.asp|archivedate= 22 December 2015|accessdate= 20 December 2012|quote= In 1954, Roger Vivier designed the first stiletto heel with its infamous bold arch for the house of Dior. \"Stiletto\" is an Italian word for a small metal dagger.}}</ref>\n\nAs time went on, stiletto heels would become known more for their erotic nature than for their ability to make height. Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels. The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after 2000 when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear, like jeans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nStiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the ''[[femme fatale]]''.
