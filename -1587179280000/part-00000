The series consists of three main titles, ''[[Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc]]'', ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', ''[[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony]]'', and a third person shooter spin-off, ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls]]''. Multiple smartphone titles, as well as various [[manga]] and [[novel]] adaptations and spin-off series, have also been released, and two [[anime]] television series, ''[[List of Danganronpa: The Animation episodes|Danganronpa: The Animation]]'' and ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School]]'', have been produced by [[Lerche (studio)|Lerche]]. The games are published in North America and Europe by [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]]. The series' name is a compound of {{nihongo3|bullet|\u5f3e\u4e38|dangan}} and {{nihongo3|refute|\u8ad6\u7834|ronpa}}.\n\nThe series follows groups of high school students who are forced into a killing game. The series received positive reviews from critics, praising the series' characters, tone, and atmosphere. Which side are you on Hope or Dispair?\n\n== Premise ==\n{{see also|List of Danganronpa characters}}\nThe series revolves around the elite high school, {{nihongo|Hope's Peak Academy|\u5e0c\u671b\u30f6\u5cf0\u5b66\u5712|Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen|lit. Kibogamine Academy}}, which, every year, selects  {{nihongo|\"Ultimate\" students|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a|ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b|lit. Super High School Level}}{{efn|An \"Ultimate\" is someone highly talented in a career or skill}} talented high school students who are in the top of their field, along with one \"Ultimate Lucky Student\" who is chosen by lottery.\n\nIn ''[[Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc]]'', Makoto Naegi, an average student selected to join Hope's Peak Academy, arrives at the school only to lose consciousness and later find himself trapped inside the school, along with fourteen other students. There, a sadistic remote-controlled bear by the name of Monokuma announces that the students will be forced to live in the school forever, offering only one way to graduate: murder another student and get away with it. When a crime scene is discovered, a {{nihongo|\"class trial\"|\u5b66\u7d1a\u88c1\u5224|gakky\u016b saiban}} is held, in which the remaining students must discuss amongst themselves who the murderer is. If they can successfully figure out who murdered the victim, the culprit alone will be executed. However, if they guess incorrectly, the culprit will be able to leave the school and everyone else will be executed.\n\nThe sequel, ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', has a similar premise, this time taking place on a tropical island known as {{nihongo|Jabberwock|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d0\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30af\u5cf6|Jabawokku-t\u014d}}. Hajime Hinata, a student who has no memory of his Ultimate talent, along with fifteen other students, are taken there by a rabbit named Usami, who states it to be a field trip to help the classmates make friends with each other. However, Monokuma interferes yet again, turning it into yet another killing game.\n\n''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls]]'', which takes place between the events of the first two games,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/23/danganronpa-another-episode-features-characters-first-two-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Features More Characters From The First Two Games - Siliconera|date=23 June 2014|work=Siliconera|access-date=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105070205/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/23/danganronpa-another-episode-features-characters-first-two-games/|archive-date=5 January 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=dmy-all}}</ref> follows Makoto's younger sister, Komaru Naegi, accompanied by Toko Fukawa, as both of them trek through a city ruled by Monokuma's influence, fighting against a group of murderous children calling themselves the Warriors of Hope. \n\nThe anime series, ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School]]'', serves as both a prologue and an epilogue to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline featured in the above games. The series is split into two arcs: ''Despair Side'', which is a prequel to Trigger Happy Havoc, and ''Future Side'', which is a sequel to Goodbye Despair. In ''Despair Side'', Hope's Peak alumna Chisa Yukizome accepts a position as a homeroom teacher at her alma mater in order to keep an eye on suspicious activities undertaken by the school. In ''Future Side'', Makoto, Kyoko, and Aoi and members of the Future Foundation are forced into another killing game against each other.\n\n''[[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony]]'' features a new storyline and has a female protagonist, Kaede Akamatsu. She becomes trapped in the \"Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles\" and forced to participate in a killing game by Monokuma and his \"Monokubs\". This sequel is only loosely related to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline, as it happens in the future.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nGameplay in the main ''Danganronpa'' games is split into three main sections: Daily Life, Deadly Life, and Class Trial. Daily follows a standard [[visual novel]] style as players explore the school grounds, converse with characters and move the story forward. During designated 'Free Time' sections, players can choose to interact with a character of their choice, learning more about them and earning new skills that can help them in the Class Trial. Deadly life is the post-murder investigation part of the story, in which you have to search around certain rooms and gather clues for the Class Trial.\nThe Class Trial is the main gameplay mode of the series, in which students discuss amongst themselves who the culprit is. This involves various different types of mini-games, the most common of which is the Nonstop Debate. Here, characters will automatically discuss the case, and it is up to the player to spot contradictions in their statements and shoot them using \"Truth Bullets\" containing the corresponding evidence. Other gameplay types include shooting letters to spell out a clue, using rhythmic button presses to argue against a specific character, and constructing a comic strip depicting the events of a murder.\n\n''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls]]'', unlike the main games, is a third-person shooter in which the protagonist, Komaru, uses a megaphone to issue commands at most of electronic objects in game, including Monokuma Robots and switches.\n\n''[[Danganronpa: Unlimited Battle]]'' is an action game where players use touchscreen controls to fling a team of four of the ''Danganronpa'' characters at enemies.\n\n== Development ==\nThe first game in the series, titled ''[[Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc|Danganronpa: Kib\u014d no Gakuen to Zetsub\u014d no K\u014dk\u014dsei]]'', was produced by Yoshinori Terasawa, who was inspired by movies such as ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Cube (film)|Cube]]''. The game uses a distinct \"pop art\" style featuring fluorescent pink blood. The game's scenario was written by Kazutaka Kodaka, with character designs by Rui Komatsuzaki. In February 2014, Kodaka revealed on his [[Twitter]] account that the story of ''Danganronpa'' was inspired by the [[Sega Dreamcast]] game ''[[Illbleed]]'', as he loved how \"crazy\" it was.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/kazkodaka/status/437957421713981440 |title=\u5c0f\u9ad8\u548c\u525b on Twitter: \"The Story of DanganRonpa is affected by \"ILLBLEED\" Dreamcast game.

(company)|Spike]]) for the [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and home computers. The series consists of three main titles, ''[[Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc]]'', ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', ''[[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony]]'', and a third person shooter spin-off, ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls]]''. Multiple smartphone titles, as well as various [[manga]] and [[novel]] adaptations and spin-off series, have also been released, and two [[anime]] television series, ''[[List of Danganronpa: The Animation episodes|Danganronpa: The Animation]]'' and ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School]]'', have been produced by [[Lerche (studio)|Lerche]]. The games are published in North America and Europe by [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]]. The series' name is a compound of {{nihongo3|bullet|\u5f3e\u4e38|dangan}} and {{nihongo3|refute|\u8ad6\u7834|ronpa}}.\n\nThe series follows groups of high school students who are forced into a killing game. The series received positive reviews from critics, praising the series' characters, tone, and atmosphere.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{see also|List of Danganronpa characters}}\nThe series revolves around the elite high school, {{nihongo|Hope's Peak Academy|\u5e0c\u671b\u30f6\u5cf0\u5b66\u5712|Kib\u014dgamine Gakuen|lit. Kibogamine Academy}}, which, every year, selects  {{nihongo|\"Ultimate\" students|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a|ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b|lit. Super High School Level}}{{efn|An \"Ultimate\" is someone highly talented in a career or skill}} talented high school students who are in the top of their field, along with one \"Ultimate Lucky Student\" who is chosen by lottery.\n\nIn ''[[Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc]]'', Makoto Naegi, an average student selected to join Hope's Peak Academy, arrives at the school only to lose consciousness and later find himself trapped inside the school, along with fourteen other students. There, a sadistic remote-controlled bear by the name of Monokuma announces that the students will be forced to live in the school forever, offering only one way to graduate: murder another student and get away with it. When a crime scene is discovered, a {{nihongo|\"class trial\"|\u5b66\u7d1a\u88c1\u5224|gakky\u016b saiban}} is held, in which the remaining students must discuss amongst themselves who the murderer is. If they can successfully figure out who murdered the victim, the culprit alone will be executed. However, if they guess incorrectly, the culprit will be able to leave the school and everyone else will be executed.\n\nThe sequel, ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair]]'', has a similar premise, this time taking place on a tropical island known as {{nihongo|Jabberwock|\u30b8\u30e3\u30d0\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30af\u5cf6|Jabawokku-t\u014d}}. Hajime Hinata, a student who has no memory of his Ultimate talent, along with fifteen other students, are taken there by a rabbit named Usami, who states it to be a field trip to help the classmates make friends with each other. However, Monokuma interferes yet again, turning it into yet another killing game.\n\n''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls]]'', which takes place between the events of the first two games,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/23/danganronpa-another-episode-features-characters-first-two-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Features More Characters From The First Two Games - Siliconera|date=23 June 2014|work=Siliconera|access-date=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105070205/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/23/danganronpa-another-episode-features-characters-first-two-games/|archive-date=5 January 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=dmy-all}}</ref> follows Makoto's younger sister, Komaru Naegi, accompanied by Toko Fukawa, as both of them trek through a city ruled by Monokuma's influence, fighting against a group of murderous children calling themselves the Warriors of Hope. \n\nThe anime series, ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School]]'', serves as both a prologue and an epilogue to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline featured in the above games. The series is split into two arcs: ''Despair Side'', which is a prequel to Trigger Happy Havoc, and ''Future Side'', which is a sequel to Goodbye Despair. In ''Despair Side'', Hope's Peak alumna Chisa Yukizome accepts a position as a homeroom teacher at her alma mater in order to keep an eye on suspicious activities undertaken by the school. In ''Future Side'', Makoto, Kyoko, and Aoi and members of the Future Foundation are forced into another killing game against each other.\n\n''[[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony]]'' features a new storyline and has a female protagonist, Kaede Akamatsu. She becomes trapped in the \"Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles\" and forced to participate in a killing game by Monokuma and his \"Monokubs\". This sequel is only loosely related to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline, as it happens in the future.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nGameplay in the main ''Danganronpa'' games is split into three main sections: Daily Life, Deadly Life, and Class Trial. Daily follows a standard [[visual novel]] style as players explore the school grounds, converse with characters and move the story forward. During designated 'Free Time' sections, players can choose to interact with a character of their choice, learning more about them and earning new skills that can help them in the Class Trial. Deadly life is the post-murder investigation part of the story, in which you have to search around certain rooms and gather clues for the Class Trial.\nThe Class Trial is the main gameplay mode of the series, in which students discuss amongst themselves who the culprit is. This involves various different types of mini-games, the most common of which is the Nonstop Debate. Here, characters will automatically discuss the case, and it is up to the player to spot contradictions in their statements and shoot them using \"Truth Bullets\" containing the corresponding evidence. Other gameplay types include shooting letters to spell out a clue, using rhythmic button presses to argue against a specific character, and constructing a comic strip depicting the events of a murder.\n\n''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls]]'', unlike the main games, is a third-person shooter in which the protagonist, Komaru, uses a megaphone to issue commands at most of electronic objects in game, including Monokuma Robots and switches.\n\n''[[Danganronpa: Unlimited Battle]]'' is an action game where players use touchscreen controls to fling a team of four of the ''Danganronpa'' characters at enemies.\n\n== Development ==\nThe first game in the series, titled ''[[Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc|Danganronpa: Kib\u014d no Gakuen to Zetsub\u014d no K\u014dk\u014dsei]]'', was produced by Yoshinori Terasawa, who was inspired by movies such as ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Cube (film)|Cube]]''. The game uses a distinct \"pop art\" style featuring fluorescent pink blood. The game's scenario was written by Kazutaka Kodaka, with character designs by Rui Komatsuzaki. In February 2014, Kodaka revealed on his [[Twitter]] account that the story of ''Danganronpa'' was inspired by the [[Sega Dreamcast]] game ''[[Illbleed]]'', as he loved how \"crazy\" it was.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/kazkodaka/status/437957421713981440 |title=\u5c0f\u9ad8\u548c\u525b on Twitter: \"The Story of DanganRonpa is affected by \"ILLBLEED\" Dreamcast game.

The band consists of [[Alex Greenwald]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), Darren Robinson (lead guitar), [[Sam Farrar]] (bass guitar) and [[Jeff Conrad]] (drums). The band is best known for its track \"[[California (Phantom Planet song)|California]]\", which became the theme song for the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[The O.C.]]''. The band featured actor [[Jason Schwartzman]] on drums until 2003 and continued to release well-received albums in his absence.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, the band announced in a blog entry on their website that they are going on \"hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely.\"<ref name=\"The Full Break Up Story\">{{Cite news\n| url = http://moviemiguel.blogspot.com/2008/11/phantom-planet-break-up.html|website=Moviemiguel.blogspot.com\n| title = Phantom Planet No More? | date = 2008-11-25\n| accessdate =\n}}</ref> They played their last pre-hiatus show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles. \n\nThe band reunited in 2019, announcing that their hiatus was over.\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1994\u20131998)===\nPhantom Planet was named in 1994 after a 1961 [[B-movie]] called ''[[The Phantom Planet]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/phantom-planet-mn0000844440/biography|title=Phantom Planet {{!}} Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> They played their first show in 1994 at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in Hollywood, California.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Most of their friends could not attend because they were still in high school.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Two of the songs they played are featured on the bonus material of the ''Chicago, Chicagogoing, Chicagogone'' DVD. Among the songs performed were \"My Friend Liz's Dad\" (misprinted as \"My Friend Liz Is Dead\" on the DVD) and a cover of the Beastie Boys 1994 song \"Sabotage\".\n\nWhile still in their teens, the group played frequently in and around the Hollywood area, finally catching the eye of [[Geffen Records]] executives. Phantom Planet signed with Geffen in 1997 and released their first effort, ''[[Phantom Planet Is Missing]]'' in [[1998 in music|1998]]. ''Phantom Planet is Missing'' showed musical similarities to the popular band [[Weezer]], with influences ranging from [[The Beach Boys]] to [[Electric Light Orchestra]], but the album failed to gain any significant ground with either critics or fans. However, as some group members started to make appearances on both the small and large screen and the group pressed on, Phantom Planet gradually built momentum.\n\n===''The Guest'' (2002\u20132003)===\nShortly thereafter Geffen Records folded into [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] as part of a major record industry merger, and within a few years Phantom Planet had signed with [[Epic Records]]. Charlotte Froom, the daughter of famed producer [[Mitchell Froom]]\u2014who had worked with [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Paul McCartney]]\u2014caught the band's show just at the time when the group was looking for a producer to record their second effort. Excited by the group's music, the young Froom approached her father to produce the group, and after meeting with Phantom Planet, he agreed. Froom also brought in engineer [[Tchad Blake]], who had worked with Pearl Jam and Sheryl Crow, to work on the record.\n\n''[[The Guest (album)|The Guest]]'' was released in 2002 and showcased a solid dose of poppy vocals, solid melodies, and sing-along choruses, which helped anchor Phantom Planet as a formidable indie outfit. The group's presence was also solidified by its commitment to touring. The group toured for almost 18 months both as a headliner and an opening act, and in late 2002 the band got the opportunity to open for one of their collective idols, the legendary Elvis Costello. ''The Guest'' got an extra boost when the record's notable power ballad \"[[California (Phantom Planet song)|California]]\" was chosen as the theme song for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]'s hit TV series ''[[The O.C.]]'' As a result, the record was reissued in late 2003 with bonus tracks and a new cover, giving Phantom Planet a whole new round of exposure.\n\n===''Phantom Planet'' (2004)===\nThe band's [[Phantom Planet (album)|eponymous third album]] in 2004 marked a change in both the band's sound and lineup. Ditching their radio-friendly pop rock, the band moved towards a [[garage rock]] sound. Lead singer [[Alex Greenwald]] stated that he wants the band to continue to change its sound. \"I love rock 'n' roll music,\" Greenwald said. \"I especially loved bands, like The Beatles, that changed with every single record they made. That's been our plan from the get-go. We want our records to be like experiments. We want to have fun with the music. People can hear when you're not having fun. They discover you're bored and you're boring.\"<ref>September 10, 2004.

He was replaced by [[Jeff Conrad]], who helped record the remainder of the album. ''Phantom Planet'' was released to mixed reviews from critics. Shortly after the album's release, guitarist [[Jacques Brautbar]] left the band to pursue a career in photography. The band performed ''Big Brat'', the album's first single, on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]].\n\n===''Raise the Dead'' (2007\u20132008)===\nEarly on in the recording process Phantom Planet's contract with Epic Records expired, which left them searching for a new record label. Soon after this, they signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]].\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Phantom Planet posted a bulletin on their Myspace page that stated that the album will officially be finished by the January 24, and that the official release date would be April 15, 2008. Fueled By Ramen re-released a teaser trailer and stated that the first single from the album will be a reworking of \"[[Do the Panic]]\".\n\nIn an interview with RaggedMag, Greenwald stated that \"all bands are kind of their own cult, you know, but we want to take it to a new level. We really like the show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and even though it's totally fiction, there's this air of mystery that's lacking in a lot entertainment these days. I really like mystery in things, and what a little bit of enigma brings out of people and their imaginations... a band is about community, and within itself it is a brotherhood; it's companionship. But a band can't be anything without the people to love it. Our goal will be to recruit and befriend as many people as possible with our message.\"\n\nWhen describing the new record, Greenwald said that \"the next record is a concept record. If [[The Beatles]] had ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper's]]'' and [[The Rolling Stones]] had ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', we have our 'Leader.' We're concocting it, but at the same time we're following it.\"\n\nThe album, titled ''[[Raise the Dead]]'', was released as scheduled on April 15, 2008.\n\n===Indefinite hiatus (2008)===\nOn November 25, 2008, Phantom Planet announced in a blog entry on their website that they would be playing their last show December 12, 2008 at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. The band issued a statement about their hiatus:\n{{cquote|This could be the most difficult piece of news we have ever had to post. Sadly, Phantom Planet will be playing our last show, December 12, at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, the same venue that we played our very first live all ages gig, back in 1994. We have had an amazing time playing together for 15 years, but we have officially decided to go on hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely. There is so much more to write, but at this time, we just want to say thank you, to everyone, for their support, friendship, inspiration, attendance, and love.\n\n-alex, darren, jeff and sam.<ref name=\"The Full Break Up Story\"/><ref>[http://phantomplanet.com/2008/11/25/phantom-planet/ Phantom Planet break up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815144638/http://phantomplanet.com/2008/11/25/phantom-planet/ |date=2009-08-15 }}</ref>}}\n\nThey played their last show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles. Alex mentioned numerous times during their last show that the band was, in fact, going on a hiatus, not breaking up.\n\nFormer drummer Jason Schwartzman makes a cheeky reference to this hiatus in his song \"Drummer\" from the Coconut Records album ''Davy'' (released January 2009). The lyrics state \"I was a drummer in a band that you've heard of / I was a drummer in a band that just broke up / Isn't that the way it goes?\"\n\nGuitarist Darren Robinson posted this message on his personal Myspace page telling fans that they are not broken up:\n\"We have NOT broken up. We are on an indefinite hiatus. That means we don't know when we'll regroup. But we are NOT broken up. I swear to you it's not just a polite way of saying we have broken up. Got it?\"\n\n===First reunion (2011\u20132013)===\nOn November 4, 2011, an official Phantom Planet reunion Twitter account was created which stated they would be reuniting in 2012. Since then, they have held their first practice in 3 years. In late January 2012, Phantom Planet announced their first reunion show, June 13, at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. On January 31, they announced the addition of a second Troubadour show to be played June 14, 2012. Former member of the band, Jacques Brautbar, joined them for songs at the June 13th show.\n\nIn August of 2013, the band, under Alex Greenwald & Phriends, performed a new song titled Balisong, which ended up being on Greenwald's solo album and later released in 2019 as a single by the full band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DczZle0U5MA|title=Alex Greenwald & Phriends (Members of Phantom Planet) perform Balisong at The Kennedy Administration|first=|last=Headquarters Music|date=8 August 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> This performance did not have bassist Sam Farrar because he was touring with Maroon 5.

The band consists of [[Alex Greenwald]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), Darren Robinson (lead guitar), [[Sam Farrar]] (bass guitar) and [[Jeff Conrad]] (drums). The band is best known for its track \"[[California (Phantom Planet song)|California]]\", which became the theme song for the [[Television program|TV series]] ''[[The O.C.]]''. The band featured actor [[Jason Schwartzman]] on drums until 2003 and continued to release well-received albums in his absence.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, the band announced in a blog entry on their website that they are going on \"hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely.\"<ref name=\"The Full Break Up Story\">{{Cite news\n| url = http://moviemiguel.blogspot.com/2008/11/phantom-planet-break-up.html|website=Moviemiguel.blogspot.com\n| title = Phantom Planet No More? | date = 2008-11-25\n| accessdate =\n}}</ref> They played their last pre-hiatus show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles. \n\nThe band reunited in 2019, announcing that their hiatus was over.\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1994\u20131998)===\nPhantom Planet was named in 1994 after a 1961 [[B-movie]] called ''[[The Phantom Planet]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/phantom-planet-mn0000844440/biography|title=Phantom Planet {{!}} Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> They played their first show in 1994 at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in Hollywood, California.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Most of their friends could not attend because they were still in high school.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Two of the songs they played are featured on the bonus material of the ''Chicago, Chicagogoing, Chicagogone'' DVD. Among the songs performed were \"My Friend Liz's Dad\" (misprinted as \"My Friend Liz Is Dead\" on the DVD) and a cover of the Beastie Boys 1994 song \"Sabotage\".\n\nWhile still in their teens, the group played frequently in and around the Hollywood area, finally catching the eye of [[Geffen Records]] executives. Phantom Planet signed with Geffen in 1997 and released their first effort, ''[[Phantom Planet Is Missing]]'' in [[1998 in music|1998]]. ''Phantom Planet is Missing'' showed musical similarities to the popular band [[Weezer]], with influences ranging from [[The Beach Boys]] to [[Electric Light Orchestra]], but the album failed to gain any significant ground with either critics or fans. However, as some group members started to make appearances on both the small and large screen and the group pressed on, Phantom Planet gradually built momentum.\n\n===''The Guest'' (2002\u20132003)===\nShortly thereafter Geffen Records folded into [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] as part of a major record industry merger, and within a few years Phantom Planet had signed with [[Epic Records]]. Charlotte Froom, the daughter of famed producer [[Mitchell Froom]]\u2014who had worked with [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Paul McCartney]]\u2014caught the band's show just at the time when the group was looking for a producer to record their second effort. Excited by the group's music, the young Froom approached her father to produce the group, and after meeting with Phantom Planet, he agreed. Froom also brought in engineer [[Tchad Blake]], who had worked with Pearl Jam and Sheryl Crow, to work on the record.\n\n''[[The Guest (album)|The Guest]]'' was released in 2002 and showcased a solid dose of poppy vocals, solid melodies, and sing-along choruses, which helped anchor Phantom Planet as a formidable indie outfit. The group's presence was also solidified by its commitment to touring. The group toured for almost 18 months both as a headliner and an opening act, and in late 2002 the band got the opportunity to open for one of their collective idols, the legendary Elvis Costello. ''The Guest'' got an extra boost when the record's notable power ballad \"[[California (Phantom Planet song)|California]]\" was chosen as the theme song for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]]'s hit TV series ''[[The O.C.]]'' As a result, the record was reissued in late 2003 with bonus tracks and a new cover, giving Phantom Planet a whole new round of exposure.\n\n===''Phantom Planet'' (2004)===\nThe band's [[Phantom Planet (album)|eponymous third album]] in 2004 marked a change in both the band's sound and lineup. Ditching their radio-friendly pop rock, the band moved towards a [[garage rock]] sound. Lead singer [[Alex Greenwald]] stated that he wants the band to continue to change its sound. \"I love rock 'n' roll music,\" Greenwald said. \"I especially loved bands, like The Beatles, that changed with every single record they made. That's been our plan from the get-go. We want our records to be like experiments. We want to have fun with the music. People can hear when you're not having fun. They discover you're bored and you're boring.\"<ref>September 10, 2004. [http://www.theocshow.com/news/news_38.htm Phantom Planet basks in glow of 'The O.C.'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928120217/http://www.theocshow.com/news/news_38.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> In the middle of recording the album, founding member and drummer [[Jason Schwartzman]] abruptly left the band to focus on his acting career. He was replaced by [[Jeff Conrad]], who helped record the remainder of the album. ''Phantom Planet'' was released to mixed reviews from critics. Shortly after the album's release, guitarist [[Jacques Brautbar]] left the band to pursue a career in photography. The band performed ''Big Brat'', the album's first single, on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]].\n\n===''Raise the Dead'' (2007\u20132008)===\nEarly on in the recording process Phantom Planet's contract with Epic Records expired, which left them searching for a new record label. Soon after this, they signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]].\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Phantom Planet posted a bulletin on their Myspace page that stated that the album will officially be finished by the January 24, and that the official release date would be April 15, 2008. Fueled By Ramen re-released a teaser trailer and stated that the first single from the album will be a reworking of \"[[Do the Panic]]\".\n\nIn an interview with RaggedMag, Greenwald stated that \"all bands are kind of their own cult, you know, but we want to take it to a new level. We really like the show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and even though it's totally fiction, there's this air of mystery that's lacking in a lot entertainment these days. I really like mystery in things, and what a little bit of enigma brings out of people and their imaginations... a band is about community, and within itself it is a brotherhood; it's companionship. But a band can't be anything without the people to love it. Our goal will be to recruit and befriend as many people as possible with our message.\"\n\nWhen describing the new record, Greenwald said that \"the next record is a concept record. If [[The Beatles]] had ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper's]]'' and [[The Rolling Stones]] had ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', we have our 'Leader.' We're concocting it, but at the same time we're following it.\"\n\nThe album, titled ''[[Raise the Dead]]'', was released as scheduled on April 15, 2008.\n\n===Indefinite hiatus (2008)===\nOn November 25, 2008, Phantom Planet announced in a blog entry on their website that they would be playing their last show December 12, 2008 at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. The band issued a statement about their hiatus:\n{{cquote|This could be the most difficult piece of news we have ever had to post. Sadly, Phantom Planet will be playing our last show, December 12, at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, the same venue that we played our very first live all ages gig, back in 1994. We have had an amazing time playing together for 15 years, but we have officially decided to go on hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely. There is so much more to write, but at this time, we just want to say thank you, to everyone, for their support, friendship, inspiration, attendance, and love.\n\n-alex, darren, jeff and sam.<ref name=\"The Full Break Up Story\"/><ref>[http://phantomplanet.com/2008/11/25/phantom-planet/ Phantom Planet break up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815144638/http://phantomplanet.com/2008/11/25/phantom-planet/ |date=2009-08-15 }}</ref>}}\n\nThey played their last show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles. Alex mentioned numerous times during their last show that the band was, in fact, going on a hiatus, not breaking up.\n\nFormer drummer Jason Schwartzman makes a cheeky reference to this hiatus in his song \"Drummer\" from the Coconut Records album ''Davy'' (released January 2009). The lyrics state \"I was a drummer in a band that you've heard of / I was a drummer in a band that just broke up / Isn't that the way it goes?\"\n\nGuitarist Darren Robinson posted this message on his personal Myspace page telling fans that they are not broken up:\n\"We have NOT broken up. We are on an indefinite hiatus. That means we don't know when we'll regroup. But we are NOT broken up. I swear to you it's not just a polite way of saying we have broken up. Got it?\"\n\n===First reunion (2011\u20132013)===\nOn November 4, 2011, an official Phantom Planet reunion Twitter account was created which stated they would be reuniting in 2012. Since then, they have held their first practice in 3 years. In late January 2012, Phantom Planet announced their first reunion show, June 13, at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. On January 31, they announced the addition of a second Troubadour show to be played June 14, 2012. Former member of the band, Jacques Brautbar, joined them for songs at the June 13th show.\n\nIn August of 2013, the band, under Alex Greenwald & Phriends, performed a new song titled Balisong, which ended up being on Greenwald's solo album and later released in 2019 as a single by the full band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DczZle0U5MA|title=Alex Greenwald & Phriends (Members of Phantom Planet) perform Balisong at The Kennedy Administration|first=|last=Headquarters Music|date=8 August 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> This performance did not have bassist Sam Farrar because he was touring with Maroon 5. He was replaced by Jamiroquai bassist Stuart Zender.\n\n===Second reunion and ''Devastator'' (2019\u2013present)===\nA Phantom Planet Instagram account <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/phantomplanet/|title=Phantom Planet (@phantomplanet) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos|website=Instagram.com}}</ref> was created on January 19, 2019, indicating that the band could be reforming.

(season 1)|Season 1]] focuses on Ryan Atwood's arrival in Newport Beach to live with Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, who take him in after his mother kicks him out. A major theme of the first season is the [[culture shock]] Ryan feels as he adjusts from a life of [[domestic abuse]] and [[poverty]] to living in a superficial high-class society. He quickly befriends and bonds with Seth Cohen, and begins to have a romantic relationship with Marissa Cooper. Although coming from very different backgrounds, Ryan soon discovers that he deals with similar issues to his new peers, such as self-identity conflict and familial alienation. The relationship between Ryan and Marissa flourishes when he supports her through her parents' divorce. As the show progresses, Ryan takes a very protective role over Marissa, showing Ryan to be a much more stable, controlled person than originally portrayed. Other storylines include Seth's development from a friendless loner to having two romantic options in Summer and Anna, as well as the arrivals of Oliver Trask, a troubled teen who befriends Marissa during their coinciding therapy sessions, and Theresa Diaz, Ryan's close friend and former love interest from his hometown of Chino. Meanwhile, Sandy Cohen frequently comes into conflict with Caleb Nichol, Kirsten's father and a wealthy industrialist who is said to \"basically own Newport.\"\n\nThe [[The O.C. (season 2)|second season]] of ''The O.C.'' continues to follow the tumultuous romantic relationships between Ryan and Marissa, Seth and Summer, and Sandy and Kirsten. Josh Schwartz, the show's creator, stated that in Season 2, the show would \"no longer be about Ryan's past; now it's going to be about Ryan's future,\" and that this season would \"slow down the storytelling a little bit ... and evolve the characters.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/560/560436p1.html |title=The O.C. Strikes Back |last=Linder |first=Brian |date=October 26, 2004 |website=IGN |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> For example, the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class, where tension is created between him and another student, Lindsay, who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner, who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted. Ryan's character begins to grow when he stands up to Lindsay and convinces her to allow him to contribute, forcing them to work together to complete the assignment. They later become involved romantically, creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now \"Cooper-Nichol\" family. The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters. A number of [[List of The O.C. characters#Recurring characters|recurring characters]] are introduced, such as D.J., Lindsay Gardner, Zach Stevens, and [[Alex Kelly (The O.C.)|Alex Kelly]], with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships. Ryan's brother, Trey Atwood, gets out of jail and threatens to bring Ryan's old life into his new one. Sandy and Kirsten also face new conflicts after drifting apart during the summer. Season 2 ends with Marissa shooting Trey after Ryan confronts him for attempting to sexually assault Marissa.\n\n[[The O.C. (season 3)|Season 3]] creates many dynamic changes with regards to relationships and power within the characters' society. Firstly, Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School. The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced to move into a trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to put food on the table for her daughters. Marissa's life begins to spiral out of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at [[Brown University]]. Sandy's moral compass becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life, and he takes over Caleb's old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more [[low-income housing]] in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. Ryan's life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa's most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.\n\nThe [[The O.C. (season 4)|fourth and final season]] begins five months after Marissa's death in the car accident. Ryan starts the season in isolation as a broken, grieving man, seeking revenge on Volchok. With the help of Julie, both she and Ryan are able to track Volchok down in Mexico, and turn him in to federal officials. The continued love of the Cohen family and the company of the eccentric Taylor Townsend guide him back to the light. Meanwhile, Seth and Summer face the problems of a long distance relationship as Summer leaves to attend college. The first half of the season focuses on the characters accepting the reality of Marissa's death. The second half focuses on the characters \"finding themselves\" while facing myriad identity crises. This final season contains multiple surprises, such as a new addition to the Cohen family, a visit to an alternate universe in which Sandy becomes mayor, and a natural disaster that leaves Newport devastated.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Further|List of The O.C. characters}}\n[[File:The O.C. cast (season 1).jpg|thumb|240px|[[The O.C.

He is the husband of Kirsten, the father of Seth Cohen, and the legal guardian of Ryan Atwood.

She is the wife of Sandy Cohen, the mother of Seth and former CFO of her father's ([[Caleb Nichol]]) real estate company, the Newport Group. Before she met Sandy she dated and grew up with Jimmy Cooper father of Marissa Cooper, with whom she remains friends. She has had trouble with alcohol, which was triggered by the failing deteriorating relationship between her and her father, and had an abortion early in her life, which belonged to Jimmy. Kirsten continues to open a dating service with Julie, and become a mother of two at the end of the fourth season. The character's politics and lifestyle are conservative, a contrast to her husband. Kelly Rowan described the character as seemingly more \"together\" than herself during an interview.<ref>{{cite episode |title=OC: Obsess Completely |series=The O.C. |credits=FOX |season=TV Special}}</ref>\n\n[[Ben McKenzie]] portrays [[Ryan Atwood]], a troubled teenager from [[Chino, California|Chino]] who is brought into the privileged community of [[Newport Beach, California]] after his mother, [[Dawn Atwood]], throws him out of their family home.

He forms fast bonds with the entire Cohen family, especially Sandy's son Seth, as well as an extreme attachment to the girl next door, Marissa Cooper. Ryan slowly finds himself a place within his new materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university.

The pool house was built for the pilot episode.\n\nAfter the show got picked up to reduce production costs the interior, backyard, and pool house was rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, CA. During some early episodes in season 2, the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling; this was probably written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu. The kitchen countertop changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble countertop. The sink in the island countertop switches to the other side and the backsplash tile changes. During the pilot episode Ryan walked out of the pool house to look at the ocean view. Past the property line there were houses, streets, cars, and land between the house and the ocean. After the set was created, there was just an ocean and sky backdrop as if the house were sitting on a cliff; also artificial grass and studio lighting looked less realistic than in the pilot episode.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music on The O.C.}}\n[[Image:TheOC-BaitShop.jpg|thumb|right|The Bait Shop, which was the fictional concert venue that staged performances in the second and third season.]]\n[[Alexandra Patsavas]], who had previously worked on shows including ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'' and ''[[Carniv\u00e0le]]'', was appointed as [[music supervisor]] on ''The O.C.''.<ref name=\"Portfolio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.portfolio.com/careers/job-of-the-week/2007/04/30/Job-of-the-Week-Music-Supervisor |title=Perfectly Attuned |last=Angelo |first=Megan |date=April 30, 2007 |work=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio|Portfolio.com]] |accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref> Patsavas worked alongside creator [[Josh Schwartz]], in selecting the music to be used.

As a way to merge the two faiths, Seth claims to have \"created [[Chrismukkah]]\" when he was six years old. The series included annual Chrismukkah episodes for every season of its run. Particulars of when exactly the holiday was celebrated were not given; Seth simply said in the first season's Chrismukkah episode that it was \"eight days of presents, followed by one day of ''many'' presents.\" Chrismukkah later received mention in the television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.\n\nIn December 2011 the pop-culture website ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewed all four Chrismukkah episodes for its \"TV Club Advent Calendar.\" The writer noted, \"When thinking back on holiday specials of yore for this project, the first thing that popped into my head wasn't nostalgia for my Rankin/Bass- and Chuck Jones-filled youth. Instead, I immediately focused on a much more recent obsession: Chrismukkah.

In addition, several of the characters talk as if they are aware that they are in a television series. One episode in the second season finds Seth commenting that \"we tried some new things,\" but that \"last year was just better,\" echoing response from fans that the second season was inferior to the first.\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' remarked that The O.C.'s \"undertone of sarcasm and self-parody' was one of the aspects of the series that made it compelling. Writer Ken Barnes opined that The O.C. took \"meta-TV\" to its \"sublime peak\" with ''The Valley''. He continued, saying that the \"device allowed producers and writers to have fun mocking critical and public perceptions of The OC, its supposed soap-operatic excesses and pop-culture obsessions.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Ken |title=What sucked us into 'The OC' orbit? |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-02-20-the-OC-finale_x.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=April 2, 2017 |date=February 21, 2007}}</ref> In a book written by [[Alan Sepinwall]] that examined the series, Sepinwall noted that \"Schwartz spends enough of his day trolling message boards to know exactly what fans are complaining about and which references to other shows and movies they've caught, and he incorporates it into his scripts.\"\n\nAn entire chapter of the book is devoted to perceived self-mockery within the series, with much attention given to the episode \"The L.A.\" from Season One.

It was created by ''The O.C.'' writer [[John Stephens (producer)|John Stephens]] and artist [[Eric Wight]], who was responsible for the comic book drawings featured on the show.\n\nIn 2005, Schwartz announced he was writing a spin-off which followed the life of Marissa's younger sister [[Kaitlin Cooper|Kaitlin]] at boarding school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/a18552/schwartz-scraps-athens-confirms-oc-spinoff.html |title=Schwartz scraps 'Athens', confirms 'OC' spinoff |last=Wilkes |first=Neil |date=January 20, 2005 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=Digital Spy Limited |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> It was set to premiere in January 2006, but the airing of the spin-off never occurred.

Schwartz planned to release a spin-off of his series ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' entitled ''[[Valley Girls]]'', originally to premiere in the fall of 2009. Schwartz wanted to tie in the younger versions of the characters from both ''The O.C.'' and the principals from ''Valley Girls'' to establish a continuity with ''Gossip Girl''.\n\nA re-adaption of the show started in September 2013 in [[Turkey]]. It soon became a wide popular series named ''[[Medcezir]]'' (meaning tide in English) featuring popular young Turkish artists [[\u00c7a\u011fatay Ulusoy]] and [[Serenay Sar\u0131kaya]]. By the New Year of 2013, first 15 Episodes were released with very positive and increasing criticism. The plot is very similar to ''The O.C.'', yet the show is a lot different by script on this adaption.\n\nThe O.C. Musical took place on August 30, 2015, at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles, selling out in minutes when tickets went on sale earlier that same month. While not officially authorized by FOX or Warner Bros. TV, Sucker Love Productions' musical was supported by the show's cast and producers, with [[Autumn Reeser]] portraying [[Julie Cooper (The O.C.)|Julie Cooper]] and briefly reprising her role as [[Taylor Townsend (The O.C.)|Taylor Townsend]] for the first time in 8 years. Creator [[Josh Schwartz]] and stars [[Rachel Bilson]], [[Melinda Clarke]], and [[Kelly Rowan]] also reunited at the musical. The cast included ''[[Awkward (TV series)|Awkward]]'' star [[Greer Grammer]] as [[Summer Roberts]] and ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' star Brendan Robinson as [[Seth Cohen]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Gustavo Arellano|Arellano, Gustavo]]. \"[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/22/opinion/oe-arellano22 Headed for reruns].\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

(season 1)|Season 1]] focuses on Ryan Atwood's arrival in Newport Beach to live with Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, who take him in after his mother kicks him out. A major theme of the first season is the [[culture shock]] Ryan feels as he adjusts from a life of [[domestic abuse]] and [[poverty]] to living in a superficial high-class society. He quickly befriends and bonds with Seth Cohen, and begins to have a romantic relationship with Marissa Cooper. Although coming from very different backgrounds, Ryan soon discovers that he deals with similar issues to his new peers, such as self-identity conflict and familial alienation. The relationship between Ryan and Marissa flourishes when he supports her through her parents' divorce. As the show progresses, Ryan takes a very protective role over Marissa, showing Ryan to be a much more stable, controlled person than originally portrayed. Other storylines include Seth's development from a friendless loner to having two romantic options in Summer and Anna, as well as the arrivals of Oliver Trask, a troubled teen who befriends Marissa during their coinciding therapy sessions, and Theresa Diaz, Ryan's close friend and former love interest from his hometown of Chino. Meanwhile, Sandy Cohen frequently comes into conflict with Caleb Nichol, Kirsten's father and a wealthy industrialist who is said to \"basically own Newport.\"\n\nThe [[The O.C. (season 2)|second season]] of ''The O.C.'' continues to follow the tumultuous romantic relationships between Ryan and Marissa, Seth and Summer, and Sandy and Kirsten. Josh Schwartz, the show's creator, stated that in Season 2, the show would \"no longer be about Ryan's past; now it's going to be about Ryan's future,\" and that this season would \"slow down the storytelling a little bit ... and evolve the characters.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/560/560436p1.html |title=The O.C. Strikes Back |last=Linder |first=Brian |date=October 26, 2004 |website=IGN |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> For example, the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class, where tension is created between him and another student, Lindsay, who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner, who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted. Ryan's character begins to grow when he stands up to Lindsay and convinces her to allow him to contribute, forcing them to work together to complete the assignment. They later become involved romantically, creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now \"Cooper-Nichol\" family. The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters. A number of [[List of The O.C. characters#Recurring characters|recurring characters]] are introduced, such as D.J., Lindsay Gardner, Zach Stevens, and [[Alex Kelly (The O.C.)|Alex Kelly]], with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships. Ryan's brother, Trey Atwood, gets out of jail and threatens to bring Ryan's old life into his new one. Sandy and Kirsten also face new conflicts after drifting apart during the summer. Season 2 ends with Marissa shooting Trey after Ryan confronts him for attempting to sexually assault Marissa.\n\n[[The O.C. (season 3)|Season 3]] creates many dynamic changes with regards to relationships and power within the characters' society. Firstly, Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School. The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced to move into a trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to put food on the table for her daughters. Marissa's life begins to spiral out of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at [[Brown University]]. Sandy's moral compass becomes imperiled when a past love interest makes her way back into his life, and he takes over Caleb's old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more [[low-income housing]] in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. Ryan's life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa's most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.\n\nThe [[The O.C. (season 4)|fourth and final season]] begins five months after Marissa's death in the car accident. Ryan starts the season in isolation as a broken, grieving man, seeking revenge on Volchok. With the help of Julie, both she and Ryan are able to track Volchok down in Mexico, and turn him in to federal officials. The continued love of the Cohen family and the company of the eccentric Taylor Townsend guide him back to the light. Meanwhile, Seth and Summer face the problems of a long distance relationship as Summer leaves to attend college. The first half of the season focuses on the characters accepting the reality of Marissa's death. The second half focuses on the characters \"finding themselves\" while facing myriad identity crises. This final season contains multiple surprises, such as a new addition to the Cohen family, a visit to an alternate universe in which Sandy becomes mayor, and a natural disaster that leaves Newport devastated.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Further|List of The O.C. characters}}\n[[File:The O.C. cast (season 1).jpg|thumb|240px|[[The O.C.

She has had trouble with alcohol, which was triggered by the failing deteriorating relationship between her and her father, and had an abortion early in her life, which belonged to Jimmy. Kirsten continues to open a dating service with Julie, and become a mother of two at the end of the fourth season. The character's politics and lifestyle are conservative, a contrast to her husband.

He forms fast bonds with the entire Cohen family, especially Sandy's son Seth, as well as an extreme attachment to the girl next door, Marissa Cooper. Ryan slowly finds himself a place within his new materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university.

At the beginning of the show she is married to financial planner [[Jimmy Cooper (The O.C.)|Jimmy Cooper]]. She is often characterized as being devious, selfish, and shallow. However, she reveals a more vulnerable and empathetic part of herself a number of times during the series. Melinda Clarke summarized her character as being \"clearly just such a money-digging whore. To me, it's so funny now to see ''[[The Real Housewives of Orange County]]'' because you realise it exists and that's what Julie was. Julie was obviously the original housewife.\" Melinda went on to commend the character's \"incredible arc,\" saying that Julie started as \"this woman who was so superficial but, of course, she's not just one-dimensional, she's multi-dimensional.

The [[Chicago Tribune]] characterized Caleb as a \"gruff, uncompromising Newport Beach, Calif., real-estate developer\". When asked by the Tribune about the character, Dale said, \"\"The thing that's lovely about this character is that there's so much to do with him.

The house is based on two homes located in Malibu, California. The exterior shots of the front of the home and the driveway were filmed from a home on Ocean Breeze Drive in Malibu, California, built in 2002. This was filmed multiple times and used continuously for all four seasons. The interior, backyard, and infinity pool were filmed for the pilot episode in another home down the street also in Malibu. The pool house was built for the pilot episode.\n\nAfter the show got picked up to reduce production costs the interior, backyard, and pool house was rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, CA. During some early episodes in season 2, the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling; this was probably written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu. The kitchen countertop changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble countertop. The sink in the island countertop switches to the other side and the backsplash tile changes. During the pilot episode Ryan walked out of the pool house to look at the ocean view. Past the property line there were houses, streets, cars, and land between the house and the ocean. After the set was created, there was just an ocean and sky backdrop as if the house were sitting on a cliff; also artificial grass and studio lighting looked less realistic than in the pilot episode.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music on The O.C.}}\n[[Image:TheOC-BaitShop.jpg|thumb|right|The Bait Shop, which was the fictional concert venue that staged performances in the second and third season.]]\n[[Alexandra Patsavas]], who had previously worked on shows including ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'' and ''[[Carniv\u00e0le]]'', was appointed as [[music supervisor]] on ''The O.C.''.<ref name=\"Portfolio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.portfolio.com/careers/job-of-the-week/2007/04/30/Job-of-the-Week-Music-Supervisor |title=Perfectly Attuned |last=Angelo |first=Megan |date=April 30, 2007 |work=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio|Portfolio.com]] |accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref> Patsavas worked alongside creator [[Josh Schwartz]], in selecting the music to be used.

Particulars of when exactly the holiday was celebrated were not given; Seth simply said in the first season's Chrismukkah episode that it was \"eight days of presents, followed by one day of ''many'' presents.\" Chrismukkah later received mention in the television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.\n\nIn December 2011 the pop-culture website ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewed all four Chrismukkah episodes for its \"TV Club Advent Calendar.\" The writer noted, \"When thinking back on holiday specials of yore for this project, the first thing that popped into my head wasn't nostalgia for my Rankin/Bass- and Chuck Jones-filled youth.

In addition, several of the characters talk as if they are aware that they are in a television series. One episode in the second season finds Seth commenting that \"we tried some new things,\" but that \"last year was just better,\" echoing response from fans that the second season was inferior to the first.\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' remarked that The O.C.'s \"undertone of sarcasm and self-parody' was one of the aspects of the series that made it compelling. Writer Ken Barnes opined that The O.C. took \"meta-TV\" to its \"sublime peak\" with ''The Valley''. He continued, saying that the \"device allowed producers and writers to have fun mocking critical and public perceptions of The OC, its supposed soap-operatic excesses and pop-culture obsessions.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Ken |title=What sucked us into 'The OC' orbit? |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-02-20-the-OC-finale_x.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=April 2, 2017 |date=February 21, 2007}}</ref> In a book written by [[Alan Sepinwall]] that examined the series, Sepinwall noted that \"Schwartz spends enough of his day trolling message boards to know exactly what fans are complaining about and which references to other shows and movies they've caught, and he incorporates it into his scripts.\"\n\nAn entire chapter of the book is devoted to perceived self-mockery within the series, with much attention given to the episode \"The L.A.\" from Season One.

It was created by ''The O.C.'' writer [[John Stephens (producer)|John Stephens]] and artist [[Eric Wight]], who was responsible for the comic book drawings featured on the show.\n\nIn 2005, Schwartz announced he was writing a spin-off which followed the life of Marissa's younger sister [[Kaitlin Cooper|Kaitlin]] at boarding school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/a18552/schwartz-scraps-athens-confirms-oc-spinoff.html |title=Schwartz scraps 'Athens', confirms 'OC' spinoff |last=Wilkes |first=Neil |date=January 20, 2005 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=Digital Spy Limited |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> It was set to premiere in January 2006, but the airing of the spin-off never occurred.

Schwartz planned to release a spin-off of his series ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' entitled ''[[Valley Girls]]'', originally to premiere in the fall of 2009. Schwartz wanted to tie in the younger versions of the characters from both ''The O.C.'' and the principals from ''Valley Girls'' to establish a continuity with ''Gossip Girl''.\n\nA re-adaption of the show started in September 2013 in [[Turkey]]. It soon became a wide popular series named ''[[Medcezir]]'' (meaning tide in English) featuring popular young Turkish artists [[\u00c7a\u011fatay Ulusoy]] and [[Serenay Sar\u0131kaya]]. By the New Year of 2013, first 15 Episodes were released with very positive and increasing criticism. The plot is very similar to ''The O.C.'', yet the show is a lot different by script on this adaption.\n\nThe O.C. Musical took place on August 30, 2015, at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles, selling out in minutes when tickets went on sale earlier that same month. While not officially authorized by FOX or Warner Bros. TV, Sucker Love Productions' musical was supported by the show's cast and producers, with [[Autumn Reeser]] portraying [[Julie Cooper (The O.C.)|Julie Cooper]] and briefly reprising her role as [[Taylor Townsend (The O.C.)|Taylor Townsend]] for the first time in 8 years. Creator [[Josh Schwartz]] and stars [[Rachel Bilson]], [[Melinda Clarke]], and [[Kelly Rowan]] also reunited at the musical. The cast included ''[[Awkward (TV series)|Awkward]]'' star [[Greer Grammer]] as [[Summer Roberts]] and ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' star Brendan Robinson as [[Seth Cohen]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Gustavo Arellano|Arellano, Gustavo]]. \"[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/22/opinion/oe-arellano22 Headed for reruns].\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.
