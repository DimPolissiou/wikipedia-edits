The film was directed by [[Richard Shepard]], who co-wrote the script with Tamar Brott.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=March 2016}}\nLucy (Arquette) is a young woman who works at a restaurant in [[Manhattan]]. She is constantly annoyed by her gambling, egotistical bosses. She has an ambition to be an [[Escapology|escape artist]], specifically a modern female version of [[Harry Houdini]], with her best friend, Vivian (Balint) as her assistant. Lucy also collects anything that once belonged to Mrs. Houdini.\n\nThe movie starts with Lucy questioning who the new bartender (Bowie) is. She finds out his name is Monte, he's from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and will tell any lie in order to get a woman to [[Marriage|marry]] him. He makes it clear he only wants to marry because he is in dire need of a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]], because if he doesn't and has to go back to Britain, he will surely die. The two chat, with Monte desperately asking Lucy out for breakfast, even though Lucy doesn't want to.\n\nLater on, Lucy is practising an escape trick when she loses her balance and becomes trapped by the [[noose]] she was planning to escape from. Her wrists and ankles are both cuffed, meaning Lucy can't free herself. She cries herself to sleep after having not been able to reach the key that unlocks the cuffs. She is awoken in the morning by a phone call. She struggles to answer it but manages to by kicking the phone onto the ground so she can hear it. It's Monte wanting to take her out for breakfast, having found her number in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. Lucy begs him to come to her [[apartment]] to untie her. He frees her legs and unties the noose but will only free her hands on the condition that she marries him. Lucy, unsettled, declines, so Monte handcuffs Lucy to himself and the bed before falling asleep, with an upset Lucy following suit.\n\nVivian enters the apartment the following morning to find Monte and Lucy asleep on the bed, handcuffed. Vivian unlocks Lucy but leaves the handcuffs on Monte. He later arises and eats a [[marshmallow]] for breakfast whilst the girls whisper in the bathroom about who gets to sleep with him.\n\nLater on, Viv and Lucy ride to an [[antique shop]] where Lucy has her eye on Mrs. Houdini's [[wedding ring]]. Lucy will do anything to have it, but is unable to purchase it, as she doesn't have the $5,000 to pay for it. Lucy wonders how she can get the money. She decides to rob the restaurant after her bosses, Dante (Gregory) and Cecil (Henry) once again decide to fine the waitresses if they don't sell enough [[dessert]]s. Monte is also present at the meeting, with one of his hands still cuffed.\n\nVivian goes to the restaurant to tell Lucy some big news: a designer is interested in meeting Viv to discuss her line of [[lingerie]]. The only problem is, Viv can only meet with the designer the following day at 3:00. This is a problem because Lucy has an [[audition]] for her escape trick, and Viv is her assistant. After an argument, Vivian storms off to go and talk to Monte, who's serving at the bar. Jealous, Lucy unlocks Monte from the handcuff and agrees to go out with him if he'll be her assistant at the audition; he accepts.\n\nMonte has his doubts about Lucy, so he strikes a deal with Jeanette (Matlin), a [[Hearing loss|deaf]] colleague: Jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. This leads to a conversation Monte has on the phone with his friend. Lucy overhears the conversation and decides to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]]. He explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.\n\nLucy confronts Monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. Both become frustrated because they both want to rob the [[restaurant]] at the same time. Lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. Unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. Lucy is obviously upset so Monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. They can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and Monte needs it all to pay Jeanette. Monte comes up with another plan: he will help Lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. This way, Monte won't need the $10,000 to pay Jeanette.\n\nLucy begins to cry again so Monte tries to cheer her up by talking about Mrs. Houdini. Lucy, still upset, explains that Mrs. Houdini was vital to Harry Houdini's escape routines: before Mr. Houdini commenced with his trick, Mrs. Houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his. Lucy's mood has improved somewhat after this so the two walk down the street and discuss the possibility of sleeping together. Monte wants to, but Lucy declines and explains Viv was hoping to sleep with him first. With Viv in mind, he suggests that a third person that doesn't work at the restaurant and wouldn't be recognised would be ideal for the [[robbery]]. Lucy agrees and the two head to Vivian's apartment, where she's working on her 'self-defence bra'.\n\nIt's later on when the trio discuss the plan: at 12:00 AM, Viv will enter the restaurant and demand money, which she will take from the register. To appear more threatening, she will carry a [[gun]] which fires blanks. It's vitally important that it happens before the 12:30 AM drop. Monte and Lucy will create some clever [[:wikt:diversion|diversions]] so that the guests will be on edge. At 11:59, they will drop a loud set of glasses to really unsettle the guests; seconds later, Viv will enter. Viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from Monte.\n\nAt 11:59, Monte and Lucy drop the [[Champagne|champagne bottles]] and glasses... But Viv doesn't show up. Thinking she has dropped out, Monte storms off, and Lucy follows. She finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. With [[adrenaline]] rushing through him, he makes out with Lucy. As it turns out, Viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. She makes [[threat]]s but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.\n\nIn the freezer, Lucy flees the room, leaving Monte confused. She tracks down Vivian, who explains what happened. The situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so Viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'Sorry, I guess I wasn't kidding... Money. Now. All of it.' Jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand Vivian because the disguise is covering her face. Annoyed, Viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. Jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. Lucy and Monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.\n\nExpecting Lucy to uphold her side of the deal, Monte heads to the [[Register office|Register Office]] and waits for her. Meanwhile, Lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. She heads over to Viv's apartment to mope. Viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. Lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. Viv asks if she and Monte tied the knot. Lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and Vivian rush to the Register Office.\n\nThe girls arrive and Monte whisks Lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her [[Identity document|I.D.]] at Viv's apartment. There is simply no time to get married any other day, so Monte leaves in anger. The two girls leave, too, and Lucy, full of guilt, confesses to Vivian that she made out with Monte. The two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]].\n\nMonte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when Cecil and Dante approach him. It is revealed that Monte didn't need to marry to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with Cecil and Dante. We also learn that Monte has a terrible [[gambling]] problem. He manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: Lucy will have one minute to escape from a [[straitjacket]], hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (In Cecil and Dante's giant [[aquarium]] at the restaurant). If she is unable to, Monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo [[plastic surgery]] to make himself look like Dante.\n\nOf course, Monte can't win without Lucy's help. He arrives at Lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. He wakes them up and discovers they have serious [[hangover]]s. Worried that they won't help him, Monte makes up a story, 'Cecil and Dante know about the robbery... I don't know how they found out... There's still hope. I made a deal- a bet-a bet with Cecil and Dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened... [If we lose,] 20 years [[Penal labour|hard labour]]'. Vivian and Monte believe that they can train Lucy, but quickly, for the stunt is to be performed the following night. Lucy trains for hours, and before long, the three fall asleep, exhausted. Vivian wakes up in the early hours of the [[morning]] and leaves, which, in turn, causes Monte and Lucy to wake up. Lucy wants to get up and train, but Monte convinces her to stay, and the two make love in Lucy's apartment.\n\nLater in the morning, Lucy is out shopping and sees Cecil and Dante driving past in a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. She tries to avoid them, but they drag her into the vehicle so they can rant about their excitement for the bet. After a bit of chatting, Lucy finds out that Cecil and Dante don't know who committed the robbery, even though Monte told her they knew. She discovers that Monte will have to pay Cecil and Dante $4,000,000 (or get plastic surgery) if he doesn't win the bet, even though Monte told her they'd go to jail if the bet was lost. Lucy is visibly shocked and asks the driver to stop before climbing out of the taxi.\n\nIt's the night of the bet and Monte is nervous, particularly because Lucy hasn't showed up. Monte learns that Cecil and Dante told her the [[truth]] about the bet. He now doubts that she will show, but begs the two men to stall the audience until she comes, so they do. Lucy finally shows up, surprising Cecil, Dante, and Monte. After an awkward arrival, she puts on the straitjacket, has her legs cuffed, and is almost in the canvas bag when Monte interrupts, wanting a 'goodbye kiss'. Lucy, still angry at him, refuses, until she sees he has Mrs. Houdini's wedding ring between his [[Tooth|teeth]].\n\nLucy is locked in the bag, suspended upside down, and dropped into the water. She appears to be struggling to escape when several [[Gunshot|gun shots]] fire. It's Vivian, dressed in a red [[disguise]] but with the same black [[veil]] covering her face. She presses her 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. She demands money and the audience give it to her whilst Monte stares in shock. Jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.\n\nWhen Viv leaves, the attention turns back to Lucy. The canvas bag is still in the water. Monte- aware that if he tries to save her, he will lose the bet- jumps into the water, before finding out that the bag is devoid of Lucy. The audience is confused until they find her on the second level of the restaurant, dripping from the water but otherwise fine.\n\nLater on, Monte is still somewhat damp but approaches Lucy nonetheless. She's less angry with him since he risked $4,000,000 to save her, but she shakes his hand and prepares to leave him for the last time. Monte calls her back and asks if she will go out with him the following day, but this time, it's for real. The two kiss before Lucy leaves. Outside, Viv is waiting by two new [[Bicycle|bikes]] from Cecil and Dante and the movie ends with the two girls riding down the dark street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Bowie]] as Monte\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Lucy \n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Jeanette\n* [[Eszter Balint]] as Vivian\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Cecil\n* [[Andre Gregory]] as Dante\n\n[[Iman (model)|Iman]] and [[Julian Lennon]] have brief cameos in the movie.<ref name=variety>{{cite web|first=Lawrence|last=Cohn|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/reviews/the-linguini-incident-1200429791/  | title=Review: The Linguini Incident | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| publisher = [[Penske Media Corporation]] | location = Los Angeles, California |  date=May 4, 1992 | accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe movie was released to VHS in 1992.\n\n==Critical response==\nReviews of the movie were mostly negative.

The film was directed by [[Richard Shepard]], who co-wrote the script with Tamar Brott.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=March 2016}}\nLucy (Arquette) is a young woman who works at a restaurant in [[Manhattan]]. She is constantly annoyed by her gambling, egotistical bosses. She has an ambition to be an [[Escapology|escape artist]], specifically a modern female version of [[Harry Houdini]], with her best friend, Vivian (Balint) as her assistant. Lucy also collects anything that once belonged to Mrs. Houdini.\n\nThe movie starts with Lucy questioning who the new bartender (Bowie) is. She finds out his name is Monte, he's from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and will tell any lie in order to get a woman to [[Marriage|marry]] him. He makes it clear he only wants to marry because he is in dire need of a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]], because if he doesn't and has to go back to Britain, he will surely die. The two chat, with Monte desperately asking Lucy out for breakfast, even though Lucy doesn't want to.\n\nLater on, Lucy is practising an escape trick when she loses her balance and becomes trapped by the [[noose]] she was planning to escape from. Her wrists and ankles are both cuffed, meaning Lucy can't free herself. She cries herself to sleep after having not been able to reach the key that unlocks the cuffs. She is awoken in the morning by a phone call. She struggles to answer it but manages to by kicking the phone onto the ground so she can hear it. It's Monte wanting to take her out for breakfast, having found her number in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. Lucy begs him to come to her [[apartment]] to untie her. He frees her legs and unties the noose but will only free her hands on the condition that she marries him. Lucy, unsettled, declines, so Monte handcuffs Lucy to himself and the bed before falling asleep, with an upset Lucy following suit.\n\nVivian enters the apartment the following morning to find Monte and Lucy asleep on the bed, handcuffed. Vivian unlocks Lucy but leaves the handcuffs on Monte. He later arises and eats a [[marshmallow]] for breakfast whilst the girls whisper in the bathroom about who gets to sleep with him.\n\nLater on, Viv and Lucy ride to an [[antique shop]] where Lucy has her eye on Mrs. Houdini's [[wedding ring]]. Lucy will do anything to have it, but is unable to purchase it, as she doesn't have the $5,000 to pay for it. Lucy wonders how she can get the money. She decides to rob the restaurant after her bosses, Dante (Gregory) and Cecil (Henry) once again decide to fine the waitresses if they don't sell enough [[dessert]]s. Monte is also present at the meeting, with one of his hands still cuffed.\n\nVivian goes to the restaurant to tell Lucy some big news: a designer is interested in meeting Viv to discuss her line of [[lingerie]]. The only problem is, Viv can only meet with the designer the following day at 3:00. This is a problem because Lucy has an [[audition]] for her escape trick, and Viv is her assistant. After an argument, Vivian storms off to go and talk to Monte, who's serving at the bar. Jealous, Lucy unlocks Monte from the handcuff and agrees to go out with him if he'll be her assistant at the audition; he accepts.\n\nMonte has his doubts about Lucy, so he strikes a deal with Jeanette (Matlin), a [[Hearing loss|deaf]] colleague: Jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. This leads to a conversation Monte has on the phone with his friend. Lucy overhears the conversation and decides to [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]]. He explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.\n\nLucy confronts Monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. Both become frustrated because they both want to rob the [[restaurant]] at the same time. Lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. Unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. Lucy is obviously upset so Monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. They can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and Monte needs it all to pay Jeanette. Monte comes up with another plan: he will help Lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. This way, Monte won't need the $10,000 to pay Jeanette.\n\nLucy begins to cry again so Monte tries to cheer her up by talking about Mrs. Houdini. Lucy, still upset, explains that Mrs. Houdini was vital to Harry Houdini's escape routines: before Mr. Houdini commenced with his trick, Mrs. Houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his.

By the time of his death, 14 years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present with millions of global adherents.\n\nSmith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]]. By 1817, he had moved with his family to the [[burned-over district]] of western New York; an area of intense religious revivalism during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith said he experienced a series of visions, including [[First Vision|one]] in 1820 during which he saw \"two personages\" (presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ), and another in 1823 in which [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] directed him to a buried book of [[golden plates]] inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], calling it a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\" or \"Mormons\", and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 which renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nIn 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. They first gathered in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] and established an outpost in [[Independence, Missouri]] which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the [[Kirtland Temple]]. The collapse of the church-sponsored [[Kirtland Safety Society]] Anti-Banking Company and violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where he became a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, when the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' criticized Smith's power and practice of polygamy, Smith and the Nauvoo city council ordered the destruction of their printing press, inflaming anti-Mormon sentiment.<ref name=\"historyOfLDS-council\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=pGi-iiz6juYC&pg=PA430&lpg=PA432 ''History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''] volume VI (1912), pp. 430-432.</ref>  Fearing an invasion of Nauvoo, Smith rode to [[Carthage, Illinois]] to stand trial, but was killed when [[Death of Joseph Smith|a mob stormed the jailhouse]].\n\nSmith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings discuss the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]], and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church that he organized, including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and the [[Community of Christ]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1805\u201327)===\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Smith}}\nSmith was born on December 23, 1805 in [[Sharon, Vermont]] to [[Lucy Mack Smith]] and her husband [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Sr.]], a merchant and farmer.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=9, 30}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=1}}</ref> Modern DNA testing of Smith's relatives suggests that his family were of Irish descent, as he carried a rare [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA]] marker within Haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] which is found almost entirely in people of Northwestern Irish descent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perego|first=Ugo A.|last2=Myres|first2=Natalie M.|last3=Woodward|first3=Scott R.|date=2005|title=Reconstructing the Y-Chromosome of Joseph Smith: Genealogical Applications|jstor=23289931|journal=Journal of Mormon History|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|location=Champaign, Illinois|volume=31|issue=2|pages=42\u201360}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=De Groote|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700249298/DNA-shows-Joseph-Smith-was-Irish.html|title=DNA shows Joseph Smith was Irish|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|date=August 8, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/conference/august-2008/joseph-smith-dna-revealed-new-clues-from-the-prophets-genes|title=Joseph Smith DNA Revealed: New Clues from the Prophet's Genes - FairMormon|work=FairMormon|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSmith suffered a crippling bone infection when he was seven and, after receiving surgery, used crutches for three years.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=21}}.</ref> The family moved to the western New York village of [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]] in 1816\u201317, after an ill-fated business venture and three years of crop failures, and they eventually took a mortgage on a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Smith Family Farm|farm]] in the nearby town of [[Manchester, New York|Manchester]].

By the time of his death, 14 years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present with millions of global adherents.\n\nSmith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]]. By 1817, he had moved with his family to the [[burned-over district]] of western New York; an area of intense religious revivalism during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith said he experienced a series of visions, including [[First Vision|one]] in 1820 during which he saw \"two personages\" (presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ), and another in 1823 in which [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] directed him to a buried book of [[golden plates]] inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], calling it a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\" or \"Mormons\", and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 which renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nIn 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. They first gathered in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] and established an outpost in [[Independence, Missouri]] which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the [[Kirtland Temple]]. The collapse of the church-sponsored [[Kirtland Safety Society]] Anti-Banking Company and violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where he became a spiritual and political leader.

{"title_page": "Logic optimization", "text_new": "{{other uses|Minimisation (disambiguation){{!}}Minimisation}}\n{{bots|deny=Citation bot}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\n'''Logic optimization''', a part of [[logic synthesis]] in [[electronics]], is the process of finding an equivalent representation of the specified [[logic circuit]] under one or more specified constraints. Generally the circuit is constrained to minimum chip area meeting a prespecified delay.\n\n==Introduction==\nWith the advent of [[logic synthesis]], one of the biggest challenges faced by the [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) industry was to find the best [[netlist]] representation of the given design description. While [[two-level logic optimization]] had long existed in the form of the [[Quine\u2013McCluskey algorithm]], later followed by the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]], the rapidly improving chip densities, and the wide adoption of [[Hardware description language|HDLs]] for circuit description, formalized the logic optimization domain as it exists today.\n\nToday, logic optimization is divided into various categories:\n\n'''Based on circuit representation''' \n* Two-level logic optimization\n* Multi-level logic optimization\n\n'''Based on circuit characteristics'''\n* Sequential logic optimization\n* Combinational logic optimization\n\n'''Based on type of execution'''\n*Graphical optimization methods\n*Tabular optimization methods\n*Algebraic optimization methods\n\nWhile a [[two-level circuit representation]] of circuits strictly refers to the flattened view of the circuit in terms of SOPs ([[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|sum-of-products]]) &mdash; which is more applicable to a [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] implementation of the design{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} &mdash; a [[multi-level representation]] is a more generic view of the circuit in terms of arbitrarily connected SOPs, POSs ([[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|product-of-sums]]), factored form etc. Logic optimization algorithms generally work either on the structural (SOPs, factored form) or functional ([[Binary decision diagram|BDDs]], ADDs) representation of the circuit.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Two-level versus multi-level representations==\nIf we have two functions ''F''<sub>1</sub> and ''F''<sub>2</sub>:\n\n: <math>F_1 = AB + AC + AD,\\,</math>\n\n: <math>F_2 = A'B + A'C + A'E.\\,</math>\n\nThe above 2-level representation takes six product terms and 24 transistors in CMOS Rep.{{Why|date=February 2010}}\n\nA functionally equivalent representation in multilevel can be:\n\n: ''P'' = ''B'' + ''C''.\n\n: ''F''<sub>1</sub> = ''AP'' + ''AD''.\n\n: ''F''<sub>2</sub> = ''A<nowiki>'</nowiki>P'' + ''A<nowiki>'</nowiki>E''.\n\nWhile the number of levels here is 3, the total number of product terms and literals reduce {{Quantify|date=February 2010}} because of the sharing of the term B + C.\n\nSimilarly, we distinguish between [[Sequential logic|sequential]] and [[Combinational logic|combinational circuits]], whose behavior can be described in terms of [[finite-state machine]] state tables/diagrams or by Boolean functions and relations respectively.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Circuit minimization in Boolean algebra==\nIn [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], '''circuit minimization''' is the problem of obtaining the smallest [[logic circuit]] (Boolean formula) that represents a given [[Boolean function]] or [[truth table]].  For the case when the boolean function is specified by a circuit (that is, we want to find an equivalent circuit of minimum size possible), the unbounded circuit minimization problem was long-conjectured to be [[polynomial hierarchy|<math>\\Sigma_2^P</math>-complete]], a result finally proved in 2008,<ref name=\"Buchfuhrer_2011\"/> but there are effective heuristics such as [[Karnaugh map]]s and the [[Quine\u2013McCluskey algorithm]] that facilitate the process.\n\n===Purpose===\nThe problem with having a complicated [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] (i.e. one with many elements, such as [[logic gate]]s) is that each element takes up physical space in its implementation and costs time and money to produce in itself. Circuit minimization may be one form of logic optimization used to reduce the area of complex logic in [[integrated circuit]]s.\n\n===Example===\nWhile there are many ways to minimize a circuit, this is an example that minimizes (or simplifies) a boolean function. Note that the boolean function carried out by the circuit is directly related to the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented.<ref name=\"Mano_2014\"/>\nConsider the circuit used to represent <math>(A \\wedge \\bar{B}) \\vee (\\bar{A} \\wedge B)</math>. It is evident that two negations, two conjunctions, and a disjunction are used in this statement. This means that to build the circuit one would need two [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverters]], two [[AND gate]]s, and an [[OR gate]].\n\nWe can simplify (minimize) the circuit by applying logical identities or using intuition. Since the example states that A is true when B is false or the other way around, we can conclude that this simply means <math>A \\neq B</math>. In terms of logical gates, [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] simply means an [[XOR gate]] (exclusive or). Therefore, <math>(A \\wedge \\bar{B}) \\vee (\\bar{A} \\wedge B) \\iff A \\neq B</math>. Then the two circuits shown below are equivalent:\n\n[[File:Circuit-minimization.svg]]\n\nYou can additionally check the correctness of the result using a [[truth table]].\n\n=={{anchor|Harvard|Svoboda|H\u00e4ndler|Kortum}}Graphical two-level logic minimization methods==\nGraphical minimization methods for two-level logic include:\n* ''[[Marquand diagram]]'' (1881) by [[Allan Marquand]] (1853\u20131924)<ref name=\"Marquand_1881\"/><ref name=\"Brown_2012\"/><!-- a precursor to Karnaugh maps, needs to be covered explicitly inhere or in a separate article - until then parked here for completeness -->\n* ''[[Harvard minimizing chart]]'' (1951) by [[Howard H.

Die Nachbarschaft von Mintermen wird durch Kanten dargestellt, die die entsprechenden Knoten miteinander verbinden. Bei dem \"Kreisgraph\" liegen s\u00e4mtliche Knoten auf einem Kreis. Um symmetrische Kanten zu bekommen, wird die Reihenfolge der Knoten (bzw. Minterme) durch den [[reflected Gray code|reflektierten Gray-Code]] festgelegt, der sich durch fortlaufende Spiegelung und Erg\u00e4nzung konstruieren l\u00e4\u00dft. Die negierten Variablen werden dabei durch Nullen, die nichtnegierten durch Einsen dargestellt. Man beginnt mit einer Variablen, die negiert (0) oder nichtnegiert (1) auftritt. Die 0 und 1 werden gespiegelt. Durch Anf\u00fcgen einer Null vor 0 und 1 und einer Eins vor die Spiegelbilder werden Terme mit 2 Variablen gebildet. Die Spiegelung und das Anf\u00fcgen von Nullen und Einsen wird wiederholt, bis die gew\u00fcnschte Zahl von n Variablen und 2<sup>n</sup> Termen erreicht ist. [\u2026] Das Minimisierungsverfahren mit dem Kreisgraphen verl\u00e4uft in folgenden Schritten: I. Aufstellung der DKF [disjunktive kanonische Form]. II. Alle Knoten, die auftretende Minterme repr\u00e4sentieren, werden gekennzeichnet. III. Alle Kanten, die markierte Knoten verbinden, werden gekennzeichnet. Der so entstandene Untergraph markiert s\u00e4mtliche [[prime implicant|Primimplikanten]]. Er setzt sich zusammen aus folgenden Unterstrukturen: isolierten Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n), 2<sup>1</sup> verbundenen Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n-1), 2<sup>2</sup> verbundenen Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n-2), 2<sup>3</sup> verbundenen Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n-3) usw. Das Auffinden der wesentlichen Primimplikanten und der Rest\u00fcberdeckung bleibt wie beim Karnaugh-Veitch-Diagramm der Geschicklichkeit \u00fcberlassen. [\u2026]}} (NB.

Generally the circuit is constrained to minimum chip area meeting a prespecified delay.\n\n==Introduction==\nWith the advent of [[logic synthesis]], one of the biggest challenges faced by the [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) industry was to find the best [[netlist]] representation of the given design description. While [[two-level logic optimization]] had long existed in the form of the [[Quine\u2013McCluskey algorithm]], later followed by the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]], the rapidly improving chip densities, and the wide adoption of [[Hardware description language|HDLs]] for circuit description, formalized the logic optimization domain as it exists today.\n\nToday, logic optimization is divided into various categories:\n\n'''Based on circuit representation''' \n* Two-level logic optimization\n* Multi-level logic optimization\n\n'''Based on circuit characteristics'''\n* Sequential logic optimization\n* Combinational logic optimization\n\n'''Based on type of execution'''\n*Graphical optimization methods\n*Tabular optimization methods\n*Algebraic optimization methods\n\nWhile a [[two-level circuit representation]] of circuits strictly refers to the flattened view of the circuit in terms of SOPs ([[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|sum-of-products]]) &mdash; which is more applicable to a [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] implementation of the design{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} &mdash; a [[multi-level representation]] is a more generic view of the circuit in terms of arbitrarily connected SOPs, POSs ([[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|product-of-sums]]), factored form etc. Logic optimization algorithms generally work either on the structural (SOPs, factored form) or functional ([[Binary decision diagram|BDDs]], ADDs) representation of the circuit.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Two-level versus multi-level representations==\nIf we have two functions ''F''<sub>1</sub> and ''F''<sub>2</sub>:\n\n: <math>F_1 = AB + AC + AD,\\,</math>\n\n: <math>F_2 = A'B + A'C + A'E.\\,</math>\n\nThe above 2-level representation takes six product terms and 24 transistors in CMOS Rep.{{Why|date=February 2010}}\n\nA functionally equivalent representation in multilevel can be:\n\n: ''P'' = ''B'' + ''C''.\n\n: ''F''<sub>1</sub> = ''AP'' + ''AD''.\n\n: ''F''<sub>2</sub> = ''A<nowiki>'</nowiki>P'' + ''A<nowiki>'</nowiki>E''.\n\nWhile the number of levels here is 3, the total number of product terms and literals reduce {{Quantify|date=February 2010}} because of the sharing of the term B + C.\n\nSimilarly, we distinguish between [[Sequential logic|sequential]] and [[Combinational logic|combinational circuits]], whose behavior can be described in terms of [[finite-state machine]] state tables/diagrams or by Boolean functions and relations respectively.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}\n\n==Circuit minimization in Boolean algebra==\nIn [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], '''circuit minimization''' is the problem of obtaining the smallest [[logic circuit]] (Boolean formula) that represents a given [[Boolean function]] or [[truth table]].  For the case when the boolean function is specified by a circuit (that is, we want to find an equivalent circuit of minimum size possible), the unbounded circuit minimization problem was long-conjectured to be [[polynomial hierarchy|<math>\\Sigma_2^P</math>-complete]], a result finally proved in 2008,<ref name=\"Buchfuhrer_2011\"/> but there are effective heuristics such as [[Karnaugh map]]s and the [[Quine\u2013McCluskey algorithm]] that facilitate the process.\n\n===Purpose===\nThe problem with having a complicated [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] (i.e. one with many elements, such as [[logic gate]]s) is that each element takes up physical space in its implementation and costs time and money to produce in itself. Circuit minimization may be one form of logic optimization used to reduce the area of complex logic in [[integrated circuit]]s.\n\n===Example===\nWhile there are many ways to minimize a circuit, this is an example that minimizes (or simplifies) a boolean function. Note that the boolean function carried out by the circuit is directly related to the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented.<ref name=\"Mano_2014\"/>\nConsider the circuit used to represent <math>(A \\wedge \\bar{B}) \\vee (\\bar{A} \\wedge B)</math>. It is evident that two negations, two conjunctions, and a disjunction are used in this statement. This means that to build the circuit one would need two [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverters]], two [[AND gate]]s, and an [[OR gate]].\n\nWe can simplify (minimize) the circuit by applying logical identities or using intuition. Since the example states that A is true when B is false or the other way around, we can conclude that this simply means <math>A \\neq B</math>. In terms of logical gates, [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] simply means an [[XOR gate]] (exclusive or). Therefore, <math>(A \\wedge \\bar{B}) \\vee (\\bar{A} \\wedge B) \\iff A \\neq B</math>. Then the two circuits shown below are equivalent:\n\n[[File:Circuit-minimization.svg]]\n\nYou can additionally check the correctness of the result using a [[truth table]].\n\n=={{anchor|Harvard|Svoboda|H\u00e4ndler|Kortum}}Graphical two-level logic minimization methods==\nGraphical minimization methods for two-level logic include:\n* ''[[Marquand diagram]]'' (1881) by [[Allan Marquand]] (1853\u20131924)<ref name=\"Marquand_1881\"/><ref name=\"Brown_2012\"/><!-- a precursor to Karnaugh maps, needs to be covered explicitly inhere or in a separate article - until then parked here for completeness -->\n* ''[[Harvard minimizing chart]]'' (1951) by [[Howard H.

Die Nachbarschaft von Mintermen wird durch Kanten dargestellt, die die entsprechenden Knoten miteinander verbinden. Bei dem \"Kreisgraph\" liegen s\u00e4mtliche Knoten auf einem Kreis. Um symmetrische Kanten zu bekommen, wird die Reihenfolge der Knoten (bzw. Minterme) durch den [[reflected Gray code|reflektierten Gray-Code]] festgelegt, der sich durch fortlaufende Spiegelung und Erg\u00e4nzung konstruieren l\u00e4\u00dft. Die negierten Variablen werden dabei durch Nullen, die nichtnegierten durch Einsen dargestellt. Man beginnt mit einer Variablen, die negiert (0) oder nichtnegiert (1) auftritt. Die 0 und 1 werden gespiegelt. Durch Anf\u00fcgen einer Null vor 0 und 1 und einer Eins vor die Spiegelbilder werden Terme mit 2 Variablen gebildet. Die Spiegelung und das Anf\u00fcgen von Nullen und Einsen wird wiederholt, bis die gew\u00fcnschte Zahl von n Variablen und 2<sup>n</sup> Termen erreicht ist. [\u2026] Das Minimisierungsverfahren mit dem Kreisgraphen verl\u00e4uft in folgenden Schritten: I. Aufstellung der DKF [disjunktive kanonische Form]. II. Alle Knoten, die auftretende Minterme repr\u00e4sentieren, werden gekennzeichnet. III. Alle Kanten, die markierte Knoten verbinden, werden gekennzeichnet. Der so entstandene Untergraph markiert s\u00e4mtliche [[prime implicant|Primimplikanten]]. Er setzt sich zusammen aus folgenden Unterstrukturen: isolierten Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n), 2<sup>1</sup> verbundenen Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n-1), 2<sup>2</sup> verbundenen Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n-2), 2<sup>3</sup> verbundenen Knoten (Primimplikant der L\u00e4nge n-3) usw.
