This year also reached 18 years of efforts by some Ghanaian sports administrators to keep the memories of the victims alive through charity efforts like donations to the needy and the creation of public awareness about the need to avoid a repeat of the 2001 tragic incident.\n\nTo create public awareness, Herbert Mensah, President of the May 9 foundation led masses of people including the physically disabled people as well as students from the Kwame Nkrumah University of science and technology and the media to walk through the principal streets of Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city and the home of his former football club, Asante Kotoko FC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citinewsroom.com/2019/05/despair-to-hope-herbert-mensah-holds-torch-18-years-after-may-9-stadium-disaster/|title=Despair to hope: Herbert Mensah holds torch 18 Years after May 9 Stadium Disaster|date=2019-05-09|website=Citi Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThrough a combination of personal resources, support from the King of Ashanti and corporate sponsorship from different organizations doing business in Ghana, 2019 saw an upscale in donations to the needy by the May 9 Foundation led by Herbert Mensah to mark the 18th annual anniversary.

In Ghana, he has been involved over the years with helping flood and fire victims, poor and sick children at different times. His primary use of donations of food, household items, cash, medical bills and other donations go straight to impact the poor and victims of disaster in Ghana.\n\nIn 2018, Mensah initiated the <nowiki>''Save a Sick Child''</nowiki> project in collaboration with paediatric medical doctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana where he made cash donations to cover the cost of surgeries on sick children who suffer a destruction of their food pipes in the throat as a result of accidental ingestion of caustic soda, a cheap raw material used for manufacturing soap in rural communities in Ghana.\n\nDoctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital have raised alarm over the increasing numbers of children of poor parents mostly from remote communities who have to feed through a tube connected through the stomach, until they are able to afford the cost of  undergoing a medical surgery to repair the damaged food pipe. The expensive cost of the surgery has prevented many children from going to school as their lives are a daily struggle with difficulty in swallowing even saliva.\n\nThrough the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Save a sick child<nowiki>''</nowiki> project , Mensah sponsored the treatment of an 11-year boy from Asankragwa in the western region of Ghana and an 8-year old boy from Wa in the Upper West region of Ghana.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/local/social/201805/352025.php|title=Two Sick Children At KATH Benefit From May 9 Project (PHOTOS)|last=Online|first=Peace FM|access-date=2018-09-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, After the Atomic Junction Gas Explosion in Accra, Ghana, Herbert Mensah led a charge to support victims and survivors through donations at the 37-military hospital in Accra. He also led some foreign companies operating in Ghana such as Conserveria Africana and Sunda International to make donations to victims of fire and flood disasters.

It is believed that the king Awantivarman paid a visit and donated a pedestal for bathing at Bhutsher.\n\nIt is also believed to be dedicated to the ancient Nagas. Hence, the name \"Naranag\". It was built by the Naga Karkotas, who are said to be Hindu Kashmiri Kayasthas of the Naga sect, known for their reverence of serpents. They used to stay here and do their sadhanas.\n\nIts architecture reveals the art of the 8th century. The government has only constructed walls to protect it from encroachments and nothing else has been done.

The women are joined by newcomer Anna, who is of [[Mixed ancestry|mixed Mohawk descent]].\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series begins with Bailey moving into her aunt's house after her uncle runs off with a younger woman. Bailey is in a serious relationship with Thunder, but after she introduces him to her father she learns that they are actually cousins. Bailey begins the search for a new boyfriend but finds the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] men she meets dull.\n\nMeanwhile, Caitlin falls in love with Butterhead, a sleazy [[lacrosse]] player who already has two children with two different women. Though she is able to separate him from his partner she struggles to keep his attention when younger women begin flirting with him.\n\nZoe, a successful lawyer, struggles against parental pressure to uphold her image and be a flawless example for the Mohawk community.\n\nAfter years spent in New York Anna returns to [[Kahnawake]] and finds that the small community is less than welcoming to a free-spirited vlogger.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-hello-mohawk-girls-you-rock-and-youre-funny/article21698855/ \"John Doyle: Hello Mohawk Girls, you rock and you\u2019re funny\"]. John Doyle, ''The Globe and Mail'', Nov. 21, 2014</ref>\n\n===Season 2===\nThe second season follows the women as their love lives become messier.\n\nBailey, who finally stands up to her friends and family and brings Jack to meet them, is crushed when Jack breaks up with her after her family threatens him.\n\nCaitlin becomes pregnant with Butterhead's child. While she is initially terrified at the prospect of being a single mother, she finds that Butterhead isn't much better as an involved father when they move into his mother's home.\n\nZoe fully embraces her fetish side and becomes involved in the bondage scene.\n\nAnna begins dating Thunder after finally standing up to Bailey but faces the disapproval of everyone else inside the community and develops [[PTSD]] after being jumped by Vicky.\n\n===Season 3===\nBailey has an affair with Lollipop's husband but eventually ends it and decides to move back to the reservation to refocus her life. She focuses on finding a Mohawk man once again.\n\nCaitlin has mixed feelings about aborting her child with Butterhead but eventually focuses on self-improvement and leaves Butterhead.\n\nZoe deals with the consequences of her freakout at Lollipop's wedding by ingratiating herself to her and even getting a boyfriend to prove she can be normal and not uptight.\n\nAnna reunites with Thunder and continues to learn more about Mohawk culture despite being exposed as being only 48% Mohawk.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\nBailey navigates wedding planning, commitment, and living with Watio. This is hard when she also has growing feelings for her painting instructor, James in Montreal. She also tries to break into a real career, but struggles.\n\nCaitlin loves the respect and encouragement she has from her flourishing relationship with Leon; unfortunately, her family and community are not supportive of her dating a black man.\n\nZoe begins seeing a psychologist who believes Zoe is dealing with a sex addiction, but Zoe denies this. She decides to run for Chief and get a boyfriend to make up for not showing up to a fundraiser she planned poorly; this does not go as well as she would have liked when she tries to balance her career and personal life with a \"Master\" in Montreal.\n\nAnna tries to fit in with the community, and does better when she drops out of school and disrespects her white mother in front of the town. This leads to Thunder breaking up with her, and Anna gradually loses more and more as she tries to prove she deserves the name \"Fauxhawk\" instead of \"Hat girl\".\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n*Jennifer Pudavick as '''Bailey''', a woman in her late-twenties who works at a cigarette factory.
