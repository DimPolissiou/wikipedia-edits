Smart pointers prevent most situations of [[memory leak]]s by making the memory deallocation automatic. More generally, they make [[object destruction]] automatic: an object controlled by a smart pointer is automatically destroyed ([[finalization|finalized]] and then deallocated) when the last (or only) owner of an object is destroyed, for example because the owner is a local variable, and execution leaves the variable's [[scope (programming)|scope]]. Smart pointers also eliminate [[dangling pointer]]s by postponing destruction until an object is no longer in use.\n\nSeveral types of smart pointers exist. Some work with [[reference counting]], others by assigning ownership of an object to one pointer. If a language supports automatic garbage collection (for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]), then smart pointers are unneeded for the reclaiming and safety aspects of memory management, yet are useful for other purposes, such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] data structure residence management and [[resource management]] of objects such as [[file handle]]s or [[network socket]]s.\n\n== History ==\nEven though C++ popularized the concept of smart pointers, especially the [[Reference counting|reference-counted]] variety, the immediate predecessor of one of the languages that inspired C++'s design had reference-counted references built into the language.

It's a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man.\n\n==Overview==\nThis sonnet observes the poet's personal transition on his interpretation of love. The speaker is no longer referring to \"Fair Youth\" when he utters the word 'love'. Rather, the poet has come to realize his own shortsightedness in his obsession with youth's materialism. The materialism of youth demonstrates the large issue at hand for this sonnet, the political and human state.\n\nReferences to the political world of Shakespeare's time are littered throughout this sonnet. As literary scholar Murray Krieger states \"Shakespeare is not likely to overlook the possibilities of metaphorical extension\".<ref>[Krieger, Murray. \"A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and Modern Poetics\". Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1964: p. 140]</ref> The idea of that state is held highly in this sonnet, \"primarily it functions in the majestic world of sovereignty, the summit of political hierarchy\".<ref>[Krieger, p. 140]</ref> The poet, however, realizes the fragility of the state as even the state is \"subject to Time's love or to Time's hate\" (124.3). The English state during Shakespeare's life was ruled by Queen Elizabeth, who was regarded as high in virtue, intelligence and status.<ref>[Felch, Susan M., Stump, Donald. \"Elizabeth I and Her Age\". New York: W.W. Norton & Company. 1st Edition. 2009]</ref> However, throughout Europe political assassinations ruled the continent and Elizabeth was not alone. She continually evaded numerous attempts at her life.<ref>[Hotson, Leslie, \"Mr. W.H.\" New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1964: 96].</ref> The sonnet extends out from the state as a political feature to \"envelop the contingencies of the human condition, the generic 'accident' of line 5\".<ref>[Krieger, Murray. \"A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and Modern Poetics\". Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1964: 141]</ref> Shakespeare does this to show the linkages between the physical state of a nation as well as the 'state' of it populous. Once the speaker demonstrates this link, \"'state' and 'accident' are finally one, so that the instabilities of the political condition may be read back into the human state at large \u2013 or at least the human state without love\" <ref>[Krieger, p. 141]. This suggests that the harshness of the state is created by the harshness of its people. \n</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 124 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 6th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n\u00d7   /  \u00d7    /  \u00d7    / \u00d7    /     \u00d7   / \nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls (124.6)\n</pre>\n\nMany metrical variants occur in this poem. Line 4 contains two of the most common: an initial reversal and a final extrametrical syllable or ''feminine ending'':\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n /    \u00d7 \u00d7    /     \u00d7    /      \u00d7     / \u00d7    / (\u00d7) \nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd. (124.4)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''. (\u00d7) = extrametrical syllable.\n\nLine 2 (as required by the rhyme scheme) also has a feminine ending. An initial reversal also occurs in line 7, with potential initial reversals occurring in lines 5, 11, and 12.\n\nLine 3 contains ''two'' occurrences of the rightward movement of an ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, <code>\u00d7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;/&nbsp;/</code>, sometimes referred to as a ''minor ionic''):\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n\u00d7   /  \u00d7    \u00d7  /      /   \u00d7   \u00d7  /      / \nAs subject to Time's love or to Time's hate, (124.3)\n</pre>\n\nMinor ionics are also potentially present in lines 1 and 10.\n\nThe meter demands a few variant pronunciations: in line 4 \"flowers\" first functions as one, then as two syllables.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=420}} Line 7's \"thrall\u00e8d\" is two syllables, and line 8's \"th'inviting\" is three.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=107}}\n\nThis sonnet's form, like many other of Shakespeare's sonnets, uses the two-part structure of a typical [[Petrarchan sonnet]] in which, \"eight lines are logically or metaphorically set against the last six [and] an octave-generalization will be followed by a particular sestet-application, an octave question will be followed by a sestet answer or at least a quatrain answer before the summarizing couplet\".<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1997. Print.</ref> In Sonnet 124 the volta occurs in the eleventh and twelfth line, though arguable there could be two voltas in this sonnet\u2014as there are at least two times in the poem where a new phrase of ideas is put forth. The first quatrain describes what the speakers' love would be like if it was simply a result of circumstance. There is then a change in thought as the second quatrain begins to attack the fickle state of the world in which the speaker and addressee reside where there is a lack of enduring resolve found wanting in politics, love, and fashion. The third quatrain continues with the description of the heretical society in which they live, but then presents the idea that the speaker's love \"alone stands\" against time, which is then supported by the appeal to witnesses in the ending couplet.\n\n== Context ==\n\nShakespeare places Sonnet 124 towards the end of the [[Fair Youth]] section of sonnets which are addressed to or concern a young man. Over the course of this first section the speaker \"tells a 'high' story of devotion, in the course of which the poet discovers that the reality of his love is the love itself rather than anything he receives from the beloved\".<ref>[Hubler, Edward, Northrop Frye, Leslie A. Fielder, Stephen Spender, and R.P. Blackmur \"The Riddle of Shakespeare's Sonnets\". First Edition. New York: Basic Books Inc., 1962: p 38]</ref> Shakespeare accomplishes this through a three cycled love phase witnessed within this \"Fair Youth\" section. The first cycle sees the poet being confident in \"Youth's\" love, where the poet \"feels that his genius as a poet is being released by [youth's love]\".<ref>[Hubler, p. 40]</ref> However, as this first cycle is completed and the second begins, youth has taken the poet's mistress and has created a rival poet. This causes the poet to become focused on his own old age and his love's winter. The final cycle witnesses the poet's rebirth, where in Sonnet 97 \"a great rush of coming-of-spring images\" <ref name=\"auto\">[Hubler, p. 41]</ref> flood the poem. This final portion of the poet's love cycle is where Sonnet 124 is positioned. Within this final section \"[The poet] replaces reproach with self-reproach, or, more accurately, he replaces disillusionment with self-knowledge, and gradually finds the possession of what he has struggled for, not in the youth as a separate person, but in the love that unites him with the youth\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAnother alternate contextual interpretation of this sonnet can be explained by Leslie Hotson. In the previous sonnet, 123, the speaker addresses time by stating \"Thy pyramids built up with newer might / To me are nothing novel\".<ref>[Hotson, Leslie, \"Mr. W.H.\" New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1964: Pg. 85]</ref> Shakespearean critic, Leslie Hotson, argues that the speaker in 123 is unimpressed by Time, which she claims to be a prince of Shakespeare's time. Hotson states that this prince is referred to in Sonnet 124 where \"This 'fortune's bastard', this victim of the 'time's hate', is&nbsp;... King Henri III of France\".<ref>[Hotson, p. 93]</ref> The atrocities that are described within Sonnet 124 parallel actions that King Henri III committed against his people as \"The first great 'accident' (line 5) or misfortune that befell [Henri III] was Paris's famous Day of Barricades\".<ref>[Hotson p. 93]</ref> Ultimately, Hotson argues that \"the blow of tralled discontent\" (Sonnet 124.7) was the speaker's reaction against a prince \"as strong as his love, Shakespeare calls to witness the English fools of the inviting time, who die 'for their religion', having lived to murder their Queen\".<ref>[Hotson p. 98]</ref> This interpretation becomes one of praise for the speaker's queen, which is clearly an \"affirmation of the strength of his love voice&nbsp;... of every true-born Englishman in the preservation of his Queen from all the treacherous attempts on her life\".<ref>[Hotson, p. 98]</ref> Shakespeare allows this speaker to praise the Queen as reference to the numerous failed \"conspiracy and other plots of assassination\" that Queen Elizabeth successfully evaded; effectively making \"love untouched by assassins' attempts\".<ref>[Hotson, p. 280]</ref>\n\n==  Analysis of key terms and themes ==\n\n===  Quatrain one ===\n\n''<poem>If my dear love were but the child of state,\nIt might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,\nAs subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,\nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.</poem>''\n\nShakespeare critic Eugene Wright suggests in his book ''The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets'' that in the first four lines of Sonnet 124 the speaker puts forth a hypothetical; if the speakers' love were the product of circumstance, then it would have no strong foundations and would be \"Fortune's bastard\".<ref>Wright, Eugene Patrick. The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen, 1993. Print. pg. 314</ref> Being \"unfather'd\" the love would then be subject to \"Time's love or to Times' hate\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Wright 314</ref> The next set of lines then alludes to the personification of Time found in [[Sonnet 123]], in which Time has a scythe (Sonnet 123. 14).<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In Sonnet 124, the scythe used by Time subjects its victims to either \"Times hate\" by putting \"weeds among weeds\" or to \"Time's love\" by gathering \"flowers with flowers\". While this interpretation is valid, other critics have interpreted the phrase \"child of state\" differently. Beeching, in his introduction to ''The Sonnets of Shakespeare'', also understands \"state\" to refer to circumstance and accident; another critic, Dowden, in his work ''The Sonnets of William Shakespeare'', believes it to mean \"born of place and power\".<ref>Shakespeare, William, and H. C. Beeching. The Sonnets of Shakespeare; with an Introduction and Notes by H.C. Beeching. Boston, London: Ginn &, 1904. Print. pg 96</ref><ref>Shakespeare, William, and Edward Dowden. The Sonnets of William Shakespeare. Folcroft, PA: Folcroft Library Editions, 1979. Print.pg 64</ref> In his notes to Shakespeare's Sonnets, editor Gollanz believes it to refer to the earl of Southampton having been a ward of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] and therefore a \"child of state\".<ref>\"Introduction.\" Introduction. Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. I. Gollancz. Dent: Temple Shakespeare, n.d. N. pag. Print. pg 7</ref>\n\nThe rhyming words in this quatrain are \"state\" with \"hate\" and \"unfather'd\" with \"gathered\". \"State\", a political term, is coupled with \"hate\"\u2014foreshadowing the speakers' negative descriptions of the political world in later lines.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \"Unfather'd\"/ \"gathered\" suggests that love that does not have a firm and fixed foundation may by subject to whim and exploited/gathered by others.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Eugene Patrick Wright maintains that the argument of this quatrain is that \"Love based upon pleasure or on political, psychological, or sociological needs has no constancy, depending on the relative nature of its foundations.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n=== Quatrain two ===\n\n''<poem>No, it was builded far from accident;\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\nWhereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:</poem>''\n\nThe second quatrain argues against the hypothetical \"if\" that the speaker's \"dear love\" is the \"child of state\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Wright, 314</ref> The speaker's love was created where it cannot be scathed by unpredictable events, an \"accident\", the \"slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune\" (Hamlet Act III. Sc.i 3). The sonnet shifts to criticizing the transitory nature of the society in which the speaker and addressee exist. Love is not subject to, \"the whims of the powerful, the anger of tyrants, or the fads of mere fashion\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> In a historical context, in ''The Sonnets of Shakespeare'', Raymond Alden suggests that, \"The time referred to is unmistakably that after the ascension of James; and the gunpowder plot is such a remarkable instance of a plot to strike a 'blow of thralled discontent'.<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Raymond Macdonald Alden. The Sonnets of Shakespeare: From the Quarto of 1609, with Variorum Readings and Commentary. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1916. Print.pg 291</ref> This is also supported by Lee who concurs in his analysis in ''Shakespeare's Sonnets. A Reproduction in Facsimile of the First Edition (1609). With Introduction and Bibliography by Sidney Lee'' that the \"time\" being alluded to mirrors the political unrest that characterized the last decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign and the first decade of King James I's reign.<ref>Shakespeare's Sonnets. A Reproduction in Facsimile of the First Edition (1609). With Introduction and Bibliography by Sidney Lee. Oxford: Claredon, n.d. Print.pg 80</ref>\n\nThe rhyming words in this quatrain are \"accident\" and \"discontent\", and \"falls\" and \"calls\". \"Accident\"/ \"Discontent\" builds on the theme introduced in the first quatrain that love that is accidental/foundation-less will lead to unhappiness/discontent.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \"Falls\"/\"Calls\" are words that suggest dependency.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> If someone falls, they must use something to catch themselves and when someone \"calls\" they are reliant upon another to answer.\n\n=== Quatrain three ===\n\n''<poem>It fears not policy, that heretic,\nWhich works on leases of short-number'd hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\nThat it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.</poem>''\n\nIn the third quatrain there is a continuation from the second quatrain in the argument that because of \"my dear love's\" constant nature \"it\" does not fear \"policy\". Policy, is \"self-serving political pragmatism\"\u2014\"that heretic/ Which works on leases of short-number'd hours\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In contrast to the fashion and politics of the time the speaker's love \"all alone stands hugely politic\". Dowden interprets this as meaning that Love if infinitely prudent, and therefore, \"It\" (the speaker's love) is the ideal policy because it is not transitory in nature, such as the policies of the governing body.<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Edward Dowden. The Sonnets of William Shakespeare. Folcroft, PA: Folcroft Library Editions, 1979. Print.pg 90</ref> There is again imagery of nature in the description that the love neither \"grows with heat, nor drowns with showers\", like a plant of flower would. \"Being beyond the physical, it is not affected by the inconstancy of things physical\".<ref name=\"auto3\">Wright, 315</ref>\n\n=== Couplet ===\n''<poem>To this I witness call the fools of time,\nWhich die for goodness, who have lived for crime.</poem>''\n\nMuch has been made out of Sonnet 124's ending couplet. In The Sonnets of Shakespeare, edited by Raymond Alden one critic describes them as, \"hopelessly obscure\".<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Raymond Macdonald Alden. The Sonnets of Shakespeare: From the Quarto of 1609, with Variorum Readings and Commentary. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1916. Print. pg 293</ref> The couplet calls forth the evidence the speaker has for his claim. As noted by Eugene Wright, the words used in the couplet, \"I witness call\", \"die\", \"crime\" use trial imagery to call forth evidence to support the sonnet's argument.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Those called to \"witness\" in this trail scene are the \"fools of Time\"- a phrase that has been dissected by numerous critics.\n\nIn his work, The Secret Drama of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Gerald Massey argues that the allusion of the \"fools of Time\" called to witness is no doubt, \"directed to Essex and his companions\".<ref>Massey, Gerald. The Secret Drama of Shakespeare's Sonnets. London: Richard Clay, 1888. Print. Pg. 207</ref> Critic Tyler (found in Raymond Alden's ''The Sonnets of Shakespeare'') further supports this, claiming, \"These expressions&nbsp;... become intelligible when considered as referring to Essex and his companions, and to the consequences of the rebellion,\" also noting that during his life Essex was known as the \"good Earl\", but died guilty of treason.<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Raymond Macdonald Alden, pg. 291</ref> The logic of assigning Essex or other exemplars of traitors as the identity of the \"fools of Time\" is also supported by Wright in his analysis in The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets where he argues that the phrase of dying for \"goodness, who have lived for crime\" demonstrates \"human propensity to think of moral propriety only when death is imminent\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> He links this idea back to Sonnet 116, arguing that those who live their lives in sin and \"crime\" and then repent at the end of their lives to \"die for goodness\" have discovered that \"Love's not Time's fool\" (Sonnet116 ).<ref name=\"auto4\">Wright 315</ref>\n\nThe afore mentioned critics are consistent with the point argued by Stephen Booth in ''Shakespeare's Sonnets/ Edited with Analytic Commentary by Stephen Booth'', that the \"fools\" are not necessarily \"witnesses\", but rather \"exhibits\" whose deaths are called to offer a cautionary tale of those whose crimes have caught up to them.<ref>Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets/ Edited with Analytic Commentary by Stephen Booth. New Haven: Yale UP, 1977. Print.pg 424</ref> In his article \"Politics, Heresy, and Martyrdom in Shakespeare's Sonnet 124\" John Klause argues against this view, noting that \" One does not 'call' exhibits, but witnesses. It is more likely that the fools are being summoned to testify from beyond the grave&nbsp;... If the foolish are to speak, it is to be on behalf of constant love\".<ref>Klause, John. \"Politics, Heresy, and Martyrdom in Shakespeare's Sonnet 124 and Titus Andronicus.\" Comp. James Schiffer. Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. New York: Garland Pub., 1999. N. pag. Print.pg.&nbsp;221\u2013222</ref> He believes that the most plausible identity for those who have died as exemplars of constant love are the martyrs, arguing,<ref>Klause 222</ref> \"But martyrs will have chosen a foolish goodness over a wise compliance that would have saved them from crime. I n the fatal choice they evoke admiration in a poet who feels that their love in some way establishes a precedent for his own\".<ref>Klause 223</ref> While this explanation certainly seems plausible, Russell Fraser in his work ''Young Shakespeare'' claims that, \"Martyrs, Protestant or Catholic, were only grist to Shakespeare's mill.<ref>Fraser, Russell A. Young Shakespeare. New York: Columbia UP, 1988. Print.pg 84</ref> To prove Klause's logic would require more conclusive evidence of Shakespeare's sympathy for martyrs.\n\nThe Jesuit conspirators, Guy Fawkes, the Earl of Essex, the conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot, and others have been suggested as the possible historical identities for \"fools of Time\".<ref name=\"auto4\"/> However, there is no clear evidence that any of these people were meant to be specifically referenced in this sonnet. As Wright suggests, \"has Shakespeare wanted to point at some particular individual or group, he likely could have found the words to do so. What the sonnet does is to use evidence adequate to support a general idea\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Blackmur, Richard P.; etc. (Edward Hubler; Northrop Frye; Leslie A.

Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1964: 141]</ref> Shakespeare does this to show the linkages between the physical state of a nation as well as the 'state' of it populous. Once the speaker demonstrates this link, \"'state' and 'accident' are finally one, so that the instabilities of the political condition may be read back into the human state at large \u2013 or at least the human state without love\" <ref>[Krieger, p. 141]. This suggests that the harshness of the state is created by the harshness of its people. \n</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 124 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 6th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n\u00d7   /  \u00d7    /  \u00d7    / \u00d7    /     \u00d7   / \nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls (124.6)\n</pre>\n\nMany metrical variants occur in this poem. Line 4 contains two of the most common: an initial reversal and a final extrametrical syllable or ''feminine ending'':\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n /    \u00d7 \u00d7    /     \u00d7    /      \u00d7     / \u00d7    / (\u00d7) \nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd. (124.4)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''. (\u00d7) = extrametrical syllable.\n\nLine 2 (as required by the rhyme scheme) also has a feminine ending. An initial reversal also occurs in line 7, with potential initial reversals occurring in lines 5, 11, and 12.\n\nLine 3 contains ''two'' occurrences of the rightward movement of an ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, <code>\u00d7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;/&nbsp;/</code>, sometimes referred to as a ''minor ionic''):\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n\u00d7   /  \u00d7    \u00d7  /      /   \u00d7   \u00d7  /      / \nAs subject to Time's love or to Time's hate, (124.3)\n</pre>\n\nMinor ionics are also potentially present in lines 1 and 10.\n\nThe meter demands a few variant pronunciations: in line 4 \"flowers\" first functions as one, then as two syllables.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=420}} Line 7's \"thrall\u00e8d\" is two syllables, and line 8's \"th'inviting\" is three.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=107}}\n\nThis sonnet's form, like many other of Shakespeare's sonnets, uses the two-part structure of a typical [[Petrarchan sonnet]] in which, \"eight lines are logically or metaphorically set against the last six [and] an octave-generalization will be followed by a particular sestet-application, an octave question will be followed by a sestet answer or at least a quatrain answer before the summarizing couplet\".<ref>Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1997. Print.</ref> In Sonnet 124 the volta occurs in the eleventh and twelfth line, though arguable there could be two voltas in this sonnet\u2014as there are at least two times in the poem where a new phrase of ideas is put forth. The first quatrain describes what the speakers' love would be like if it was simply a result of circumstance. There is then a change in thought as the second quatrain begins to attack the fickle state of the world in which the speaker and addressee reside where there is a lack of enduring resolve found wanting in politics, love, and fashion. The third quatrain continues with the description of the heretical society in which they live, but then presents the idea that the speaker's love \"alone stands\" against time, which is then supported by the appeal to witnesses in the ending couplet.\n\n== Context ==\n\nShakespeare places Sonnet 124 towards the end of the [[Fair Youth]] section of sonnets which are addressed to or concern a young man. Over the course of this first section the speaker \"tells a 'high' story of devotion, in the course of which the poet discovers that the reality of his love is the love itself rather than anything he receives from the beloved\".<ref>[Hubler, Edward, Northrop Frye, Leslie A. Fielder, Stephen Spender, and R.P. Blackmur \"The Riddle of Shakespeare's Sonnets\". First Edition. New York: Basic Books Inc., 1962: p 38]</ref> Shakespeare accomplishes this through a three cycled love phase witnessed within this \"Fair Youth\" section. The first cycle sees the poet being confident in \"Youth's\" love, where the poet \"feels that his genius as a poet is being released by [youth's love]\".<ref>[Hubler, p. 40]</ref> However, as this first cycle is completed and the second begins, youth has taken the poet's mistress and has created a rival poet. This causes the poet to become focused on his own old age and his love's winter. The final cycle witnesses the poet's rebirth, where in Sonnet 97 \"a great rush of coming-of-spring images\" <ref name=\"auto\">[Hubler, p. 41]</ref> flood the poem. This final portion of the poet's love cycle is where Sonnet 124 is positioned. Within this final section \"[The poet] replaces reproach with self-reproach, or, more accurately, he replaces disillusionment with self-knowledge, and gradually finds the possession of what he has struggled for, not in the youth as a separate person, but in the love that unites him with the youth\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAnother alternate contextual interpretation of this sonnet can be explained by Leslie Hotson. In the previous sonnet, 123, the speaker addresses time by stating \"Thy pyramids built up with newer might / To me are nothing novel\".<ref>[Hotson, Leslie, \"Mr. W.H.\" New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1964: Pg. 85]</ref> Shakespearean critic, Leslie Hotson, argues that the speaker in 123 is unimpressed by Time, which she claims to be a prince of Shakespeare's time. Hotson states that this prince is referred to in Sonnet 124 where \"This 'fortune's bastard', this victim of the 'time's hate', is&nbsp;... King Henri III of France\".<ref>[Hotson, p. 93]</ref> The atrocities that are described within Sonnet 124 parallel actions that King Henri III committed against his people as \"The first great 'accident' (line 5) or misfortune that befell [Henri III] was Paris's famous Day of Barricades\".<ref>[Hotson p. 93]</ref> Ultimately, Hotson argues that \"the blow of tralled discontent\" (Sonnet 124.7) was the speaker's reaction against a prince \"as strong as his love, Shakespeare calls to witness the English fools of the inviting time, who die 'for their religion', having lived to murder their Queen\".<ref>[Hotson p. 98]</ref> This interpretation becomes one of praise for the speaker's queen, which is clearly an \"affirmation of the strength of his love voice&nbsp;... of every true-born Englishman in the preservation of his Queen from all the treacherous attempts on her life\".<ref>[Hotson, p. 98]</ref> Shakespeare allows this speaker to praise the Queen as reference to the numerous failed \"conspiracy and other plots of assassination\" that Queen Elizabeth successfully evaded; effectively making \"love untouched by assassins' attempts\".<ref>[Hotson, p. 280]</ref>\n\n==  Analysis of key terms and themes ==\n\n===  Quatrain one ===\n\n''<poem>If my dear love were but the child of state,\nIt might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,\nAs subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,\nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.</poem>''\n\nShakespeare critic Eugene Wright suggests in his book ''The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets'' that in the first four lines of Sonnet 124 the speaker puts forth a hypothetical; if the speakers' love were the product of circumstance, then it would have no strong foundations and would be \"Fortune's bastard\".<ref>Wright, Eugene Patrick. The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen, 1993. Print. pg. 314</ref> Being \"unfather'd\" the love would then be subject to \"Time's love or to Times' hate\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Wright 314</ref> The next set of lines then alludes to the personification of Time found in [[Sonnet 123]], in which Time has a scythe (Sonnet 123. 14).<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In Sonnet 124, the scythe used by Time subjects its victims to either \"Times hate\" by putting \"weeds among weeds\" or to \"Time's love\" by gathering \"flowers with flowers\". While this interpretation is valid, other critics have interpreted the phrase \"child of state\" differently. Beeching, in his introduction to ''The Sonnets of Shakespeare'', also understands \"state\" to refer to circumstance and accident; another critic, Dowden, in his work ''The Sonnets of William Shakespeare'', believes it to mean \"born of place and power\".<ref>Shakespeare, William, and H. C. Beeching. The Sonnets of Shakespeare; with an Introduction and Notes by H.C. Beeching. Boston, London: Ginn &, 1904. Print. pg 96</ref><ref>Shakespeare, William, and Edward Dowden. The Sonnets of William Shakespeare. Folcroft, PA: Folcroft Library Editions, 1979. Print.pg 64</ref> In his notes to Shakespeare's Sonnets, editor Gollanz believes it to refer to the earl of Southampton having been a ward of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] and therefore a \"child of state\".<ref>\"Introduction.\" Introduction. Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. I. Gollancz. Dent: Temple Shakespeare, n.d. N. pag. Print. pg 7</ref>\n\nThe rhyming words in this quatrain are \"state\" with \"hate\" and \"unfather'd\" with \"gathered\". \"State\", a political term, is coupled with \"hate\"\u2014foreshadowing the speakers' negative descriptions of the political world in later lines.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \"Unfather'd\"/ \"gathered\" suggests that love that does not have a firm and fixed foundation may by subject to whim and exploited/gathered by others.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Eugene Patrick Wright maintains that the argument of this quatrain is that \"Love based upon pleasure or on political, psychological, or sociological needs has no constancy, depending on the relative nature of its foundations.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n=== Quatrain two ===\n\n''<poem>No, it was builded far from accident;\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\nWhereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:</poem>''\n\nThe second quatrain argues against the hypothetical \"if\" that the speaker's \"dear love\" is the \"child of state\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Wright, 314</ref> The speaker's love was created where it cannot be scathed by unpredictable events, an \"accident\", the \"slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune\" (Hamlet Act III. Sc.i 3). The sonnet shifts to criticizing the transitory nature of the society in which the speaker and addressee exist. Love is not subject to, \"the whims of the powerful, the anger of tyrants, or the fads of mere fashion\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/> In a historical context, in ''The Sonnets of Shakespeare'', Raymond Alden suggests that, \"The time referred to is unmistakably that after the ascension of James; and the gunpowder plot is such a remarkable instance of a plot to strike a 'blow of thralled discontent'.<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Raymond Macdonald Alden. The Sonnets of Shakespeare: From the Quarto of 1609, with Variorum Readings and Commentary. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1916. Print.pg 291</ref> This is also supported by Lee who concurs in his analysis in ''Shakespeare's Sonnets. A Reproduction in Facsimile of the First Edition (1609). With Introduction and Bibliography by Sidney Lee'' that the \"time\" being alluded to mirrors the political unrest that characterized the last decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign and the first decade of King James I's reign.<ref>Shakespeare's Sonnets. A Reproduction in Facsimile of the First Edition (1609). With Introduction and Bibliography by Sidney Lee. Oxford: Claredon, n.d. Print.pg 80</ref>\n\nThe rhyming words in this quatrain are \"accident\" and \"discontent\", and \"falls\" and \"calls\". \"Accident\"/ \"Discontent\" builds on the theme introduced in the first quatrain that love that is accidental/foundation-less will lead to unhappiness/discontent.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \"Falls\"/\"Calls\" are words that suggest dependency.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> If someone falls, they must use something to catch themselves and when someone \"calls\" they are reliant upon another to answer.\n\n=== Quatrain three ===\n\n''<poem>It fears not policy, that heretic,\nWhich works on leases of short-number'd hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\nThat it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.</poem>''\n\nIn the third quatrain there is a continuation from the second quatrain in the argument that because of \"my dear love's\" constant nature \"it\" does not fear \"policy\". Policy, is \"self-serving political pragmatism\"\u2014\"that heretic/ Which works on leases of short-number'd hours\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In contrast to the fashion and politics of the time the speaker's love \"all alone stands hugely politic\". Dowden interprets this as meaning that Love if infinitely prudent, and therefore, \"It\" (the speaker's love) is the ideal policy because it is not transitory in nature, such as the policies of the governing body.<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Edward Dowden. The Sonnets of William Shakespeare. Folcroft, PA: Folcroft Library Editions, 1979. Print.pg 90</ref> There is again imagery of nature in the description that the love neither \"grows with heat, nor drowns with showers\", like a plant of flower would. \"Being beyond the physical, it is not affected by the inconstancy of things physical\".<ref name=\"auto3\">Wright, 315</ref>\n\n=== Couplet ===\n''<poem>To this I witness call the fools of time,\nWhich die for goodness, who have lived for crime.</poem>''\n\nMuch has been made out of Sonnet 124's ending couplet. In The Sonnets of Shakespeare, edited by Raymond Alden one critic describes them as, \"hopelessly obscure\".<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Raymond Macdonald Alden. The Sonnets of Shakespeare: From the Quarto of 1609, with Variorum Readings and Commentary. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1916. Print. pg 293</ref> The couplet calls forth the evidence the speaker has for his claim. As noted by Eugene Wright, the words used in the couplet, \"I witness call\", \"die\", \"crime\" use trial imagery to call forth evidence to support the sonnet's argument.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Those called to \"witness\" in this trail scene are the \"fools of Time\"- a phrase that has been dissected by numerous critics.\n\nIn his work, The Secret Drama of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Gerald Massey argues that the allusion of the \"fools of Time\" called to witness is no doubt, \"directed to Essex and his companions\".<ref>Massey, Gerald. The Secret Drama of Shakespeare's Sonnets. London: Richard Clay, 1888. Print. Pg. 207</ref> Critic Tyler (found in Raymond Alden's ''The Sonnets of Shakespeare'') further supports this, claiming, \"These expressions&nbsp;... become intelligible when considered as referring to Essex and his companions, and to the consequences of the rebellion,\" also noting that during his life Essex was known as the \"good Earl\", but died guilty of treason.<ref>Shakespeare, William, and Raymond Macdonald Alden, pg. 291</ref> The logic of assigning Essex or other exemplars of traitors as the identity of the \"fools of Time\" is also supported by Wright in his analysis in The Structure of Shakespeare's Sonnets where he argues that the phrase of dying for \"goodness, who have lived for crime\" demonstrates \"human propensity to think of moral propriety only when death is imminent\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> He links this idea back to Sonnet 116, arguing that those who live their lives in sin and \"crime\" and then repent at the end of their lives to \"die for goodness\" have discovered that \"Love's not Time's fool\" (Sonnet116 ).<ref name=\"auto4\">Wright 315</ref>\n\nThe afore mentioned critics are consistent with the point argued by Stephen Booth in ''Shakespeare's Sonnets/ Edited with Analytic Commentary by Stephen Booth'', that the \"fools\" are not necessarily \"witnesses\", but rather \"exhibits\" whose deaths are called to offer a cautionary tale of those whose crimes have caught up to them.<ref>Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets/ Edited with Analytic Commentary by Stephen Booth. New Haven: Yale UP, 1977. Print.pg 424</ref> In his article \"Politics, Heresy, and Martyrdom in Shakespeare's Sonnet 124\" John Klause argues against this view, noting that \" One does not 'call' exhibits, but witnesses. It is more likely that the fools are being summoned to testify from beyond the grave&nbsp;... If the foolish are to speak, it is to be on behalf of constant love\".<ref>Klause, John. \"Politics, Heresy, and Martyrdom in Shakespeare's Sonnet 124 and Titus Andronicus.\" Comp. James Schiffer. Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. New York: Garland Pub., 1999. N. pag. Print.pg.&nbsp;221\u2013222</ref> He believes that the most plausible identity for those who have died as exemplars of constant love are the martyrs, arguing,<ref>Klause 222</ref> \"But martyrs will have chosen a foolish goodness over a wise compliance that would have saved them from crime. I n the fatal choice they evoke admiration in a poet who feels that their love in some way establishes a precedent for his own\".<ref>Klause 223</ref> While this explanation certainly seems plausible, Russell Fraser in his work ''Young Shakespeare'' claims that, \"Martyrs, Protestant or Catholic, were only grist to Shakespeare's mill.<ref>Fraser, Russell A. Young Shakespeare. New York: Columbia UP, 1988. Print.pg 84</ref> To prove Klause's logic would require more conclusive evidence of Shakespeare's sympathy for martyrs.\n\nThe Jesuit conspirators, Guy Fawkes, the Earl of Essex, the conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot, and others have been suggested as the possible historical identities for \"fools of Time\".<ref name=\"auto4\"/> However, there is no clear evidence that any of these people were meant to be specifically referenced in this sonnet. As Wright suggests, \"has Shakespeare wanted to point at some particular individual or group, he likely could have found the words to do so. What the sonnet does is to use evidence adequate to support a general idea\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Blackmur, Richard P.; etc. (Edward Hubler; Northrop Frye; Leslie A.

The migration of these Western steppe herders (WSH), with the Yamnaya horizon (ca. 3300\u20132700 BCE) as their earliest representative, contributed not only to the European Corded Ware culture (ca. 2500\u20132200 BCE) but also to steppe cultures located between the Caspian Sea and the Altai-Sayan mountain region, such as the Afanasievo (ca. 3300\u20132500 BCE) and later Sintashta (2100\u20131800 BCE) and Andronovo (1800\u20131300 BCE) cultures.\"{{sfn|Jeong|2018}} }} This ancestry is often referred to as '''Yamnaya Ancestry''', '''Steppe Ancestry''' or '''Steppe-Related Ancestry'''.{{sfn|Jeong|2019}}\n\nWSHs are considered descended from [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) who received some admixture from [[Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (CHGs) during the [[Neolithic]]. The [[Y-DNA]] of the WSHs was mostly types of [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] and [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], which are EHG lineages, suggesting that CHG admixture among the WSHs came through EHG males mixing with CHG females.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}} Around 3,000 BC, people of the [[Yamnaya culture]], who belonged to the WSH cluster, embarked on a massive expansion throughout [[Eurasia]], which might have resulted in the dispersal of [[Indo-European languages]]. WSH ancestry from this period is often referred to as '''Steppe Early and Middle Bronze Age''' ('''Steppe EMBA''') ancestry.{{Efn|name=Distinction|\"We collectively refer to as \u201cWestern Steppe Herders (WSH)\u201d: the earlier populations associated with the Yamnaya and Afanasievo cultures (often called \u201csteppe Early and Middle Bronze Age\u201d; \u201csteppe_EMBA\u201d) and the later ones associated with many cultures such as Potapovka, Sintashta, Srubnaya and Andronovo to name a few (often called \u201csteppe Middle and Late Bronze Age\u201d; \u201csteppe_MLBA\u201d).\"{{sfn|Jeong|2019}} }}\n\nThis expansion led to the rise of the [[Corded Ware culture]], whose members were of about 75% WSH ancestry, and the virtual disappearance of the Y-DNA of [[Early European Farmers]] (EEFs) from the European gene pool, significantly altering the cultural and genetic landscape of Europe. During the [[Bronze Age]], Corded Ware people with admixture from Central Europe remigrated onto the steppe, forming a type of WSH ancestry often referred to as '''Steppe Middle and Late Bronze Age''' ('''Steppe MLBA''') ancestry.{{Efn|name=Distinction}} Through the [[Sintashta culture]], [[Andronovo culture]] and [[Srubnaya culture]], Steppe MLBA was carried into [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]] along with [[Indo-Iranian languages]], leaving a long-lasting cultural and genetic legacy.\n\nThe modern population of Europe can largely be modeled as a mixture of WHG ([[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]), EEF and WSH. In Europe, WSH ancestry peaks among [[Norwegians]] (ca. 50%), while in South Asia, it peaks among the [[Kalash people]] (ca. 50%) and [[Brahmins]].\n\n== Summary ==\nA summary of several genetic studies published in 2015 is given by {{Harvp|Heyd|2017}}:\n\n* Western Steppe Herders component \"is lower in southern Europe and higher in northern Europe\", where it is shared by more than 50 per cent of the current inhabitants of Norway, Lithuania and Estonia ({{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}); \n* It is linked to the migrations of [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] populations dated to ca. 3000 BCE ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}}; {{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}});\n*Genetic transmission passed from steppe Yamnaya directly to the [[Corded Ware culture|Corded Ware]]\u2013[[Single Grave culture|Single Grave]]\u2013[[Battle Axe culture|Battle Axe]] Complex ({{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}});\n*Third-millennium Europe (and prehistoric Europe in general) was \"a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacement\" ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}});\n*The Yamnaya migrations are linked to the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}}; {{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}});\n*The plague (''[[Yersinia pestis]]'') has killed prehistoric humans in Europe during the third millennium BCE ({{harvnb|Rasmussen|Allentoft|Nielsen|Orlando|2015}}), and it stems from the Eurasian steppes;\n*Yamnaya peoples have the highest ever calculated genetic selection for stature ({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}});\n*Yamnaya peoples were fair-skinned but had dark eye colours; blue eyes were more common in the Corded Ware\u2013Single Grave\u2013Battle Axe Complex, but the lactase persistence mutation was not yet present ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}}).\n\n==Studies==\n===''Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe''===\nA ground-breaking study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 2015 found the ancestry of the people of the [[Yamnaya culture]] to be a mix of [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]] and another unidentified population. All seven Yamnaya males surveyed were found to belong to subclade [[Haplogroup R-M269|R-M269]] of [[haplogroup R1b]]. R1b had earlier been detected among EHGs living further north.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}\n\nThe study found that people of the [[Corded Ware culture]] were of approximately 75% WSH ancestry, being descended from Yamnaya people who had mixed with Middle Neolithic Europeans. This suggested that the Yamnaya people embarked on a massive expansion ca. 3,000 BC, which might have played a role in the dispersal of [[Indo-European languages]] in Europe. At this time, [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups common among [[Early European Farmers]] (EEFs), such as [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], disappear almost entirely in [[Central Europe]], and is replaced by haplotypes of R1b and [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]], which are common among WSH. EEF mtDNA decreases significantly as well, and is replaced by WSH types, suggesting that the Yamnaya expansion was carried out by both males and females. In the aftermath of the Yamnaya expansion there appears to have been a resurgence of EEF and [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] (WHG) ancestry in Central Europe, as this is detected in samples from the [[Bell Beaker culture]] and its successor the [[Unetice culture]].{{sfn|Haak|2015}} The Bell Beaker culture had about 50% WSH ancestry.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\nAll modern European populations can be modeled as a mixture of WHG, EEF and WSH. WSH ancestry is more common in [[Northern Europe]] than [[Southern Europe]]. Of modern populations surveyed in the study, [[Norwegians]] were found to have the largest amount of WSH ancestry, which among them exceeded 50%.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}\n\n===''Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in June 2015 examined the Y-DNA of five Yamnaya males. Four belonged to types of [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b1a2]], while one belonged to [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a2a1b1b]]. The study found that the Neolithic farmers of Central Europe had been \"largely replaced\" by Yamnaya people around 3,000 BC. This replacement altered not only the genetic landscape, but also the cultural landscape of Europe in many respects.{{sfn|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015}}\n\nIt was discovered that the people of the contemporary [[Afanasievo culture]] of southern [[Siberia]] were \"genetically indistinguishable\" from the Yamnaya and thus largely of WSH ancestry. People of the Corded Ware culture, the Bell Beaker culture, the Unetice culture and the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] displayed close genetic affinity to WSH. The authors of the study suggested that the [[Sintashta culture]] of [[Central Asia]] emerged as a result of an eastward migration from Central Europe of Corded Ware people with both WSH and European Neolithic farmer ancestry.{{sfn|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015}}\n\n===''Upper Palaeolithic genomes reveal deep roots of modern Eurasians''===\nA genetic study published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' in November 2015, found that the WSHs were descended from admixture between EHGs and [[Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (CHGs).

Like in Yamnaya, males of Poltavka mostly carried types of R1b, while Srubnaya males carried types of R1a.({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}})\n\nThe study found that most modern Europeans could be modelled as a mixture between WHG, EEF and WSH.{{Efn|\"Most present-day Europeans can be modeled as a mixture of three ancient populations related to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (WHG), early farmers (EEF) and steppe pastoralists (Yamnaya).\"({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}}) }}\n\n===''Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in July 2016 found that WSHs were a mixture of EHGs and \"a population related to people of the Iran Chalcolithic\". EHGs were modeled as being of 75% [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) descent. A significant presence of WSH ancestry among populations of [[South Asia]] was detected. Here WSH ancestry peaked at 50% among the [[Kalash people]], which is a level similar to modern populations of Northern Europe.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}}\n\n===''Genetic Origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in August 2017 examined the genetic origins of the [[Mycenaeans]] and the [[Minoans]]. Contrary to the Minoans, the Mycenaeans were found to harbor about 15% WSH ancestry. It was found that Mycenaeans could be modelled as a mixture of WSH and Minoan ancestry. This suggests that the Mycenaeans arrived in [[Greece]] as a southern wing of the [[Indo-European migrations]].{{sfn|Lazaridis|2017}}\n\n===''The Beaker phenomenon and the genomic transformation of northwest Europe''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in February 2018 examined the entry of WSH ancestry into the [[British Isles]]. WSH ancestry was found to have been carried into the British Isles by the Bell Beaker culture in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. The migrations of Bell Beakers were accompanied with \"a replacement of ~90% of Britain's gene pool within a few hundred years\". The gene pool in the British Isles had previously been dominated by EEFs with slight WHG admixture.{{Efn|\"[M]igration played a key role in the further dissemination of the Beaker Complex, a phenomenon we document most clearly in Britain, where the spread of the Beaker Complex introduced high levels of Steppe-related ancestry and was associated with a replacement of ~90% of Britain\u2019s gene pool within a few hundred years.\"{{sfn|Olalde|2018}} }}\n\n[[Y-DNA]] in parts of the modern British Isles belongs almost entirely to [[Haplogroup R-M269|R-M269]], a WSH lineage, which is thought to have been brought to the isles with Bell Beakers.{{sfn|Olalde|2018}}\n\n===''The Genomic History of Southeastern Europe''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in February 2018 noted that the modern population of Europe can largely be modeled as a mixture between EHG, WHG, WSH and EEF.{{Efn|\"It has previously been shown that the great majority of European ancestry derives from three distinct sources. First, \u201chunter-gatherer-related\u201d ancestry that is more closely related to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Europe than to any other population, and can be further subdivided into \u201cEastern\u201d (EHG) and \u201cWestern\u201d (WHG) hunter-gatherer-related ancestry.7 Second, \u201cNW Anatolian Neolithic-related\u201d ancestry related to the Neolithic farmers of northwest Anatolia and tightly linked to the appearance of agriculture. The third source, \u201csteppe-related\u201d ancestry, appears in Western Europe during the Late Neolithic to Bronze Age transition and is ultimately derived from a population related to Yamnaya steppe pastoralists. Steppe-related ancestry itself can be modeled as a mixture of EHG-related ancestry, and ancestry related to Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers of the Caucasus (CHG) and the first farmers of northern Iran.\"{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} }}\n\nThe study examined individuals from the [[Globular Amphora culture]], who bordered the Yamnaya. Globular Amphora culture people were found to have no WSH ancestry, suggesting that cultural differences and genetic differences were connected.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\nNotably, WSH ancestry was detected among two individuals buried in modern-day [[Bulgaria]] ca. 4,500 BC. This showed that WSH ancestry appeared outside of the steppe 2,000 years earlier than previously believed.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\n===''Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe''===\nA genetic study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' in November 2018 examined the presence of WSH ancestry in the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. A number of remains from Late Bronze Age individuals buried around [[Lake Baikal]] were studied. These individuals had only 7% WSH ancestry, suggesting that pastoralism was adopted on the Eastern Steppe through cultural transmission rather than genetic displacement.{{sfn|Jeong|2018}}\n\nThe study found that WSH ancestry found among Late Bronze Age populations of the south Siberia such as the [[Karasuk culture]] was transmitted through the Andronovo culture rather than the earlier Afanasievo culture, whose genetic legacy in the region by this time was virtually non-existent.{{sfn|Jeong|2018}}\n\n===''Ancient Human Genome-Wide Data From a 3000-Year Interval in the Caucasus Corresponds with Eco-Geographic Regions''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature Communications'' in February 2019 compared the genetic origins of the Yamnaya culture and the [[Maikop culture]]. It found that most of the EEF ancestry found among the Yamnaya culture was derived from the [[Globular Amphora culture]] and the [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture]] of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wang|2019}}{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|p=32}} Total EEF ancestry among the Yamnaya has been estimated at 10-18%. Given the high amount of EEF ancestry in the Maikop culture, this makes it impossible for the Maikop culture to have been a major source of CHG ancestry among the WSHs. Admixture from the CHGs into the WSHs must thus have happened at an earlier date.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|p=32}}\n\n===''The genomic history of the Iberian Peninsula over the past 8000 years''===\nA genetic study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in March 2019 analyzed the process by which WSH ancestry entered the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The earliest evidence of WSH ancestry here was found from an individual living in Iberia in 2,200 BC in close proximity with native populations. By 2,000 BC, the native [[Y-DNA]] of Iberia ([[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2]] and [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]]) had been almost entirely replaced with single WSH lineage, R-M269. mtDNA in Iberia at this time was however still mostly of native origin, affirming that the entry of WSH ancestry in Iberia was primarily male-driven.{{Efn|\"We reveal sporadic contacts between Iberia and North Africa by ~2500 BCE, and by ~2000 BCE the replacement of 40% of Iberia\u2019s ancestry and nearly 100% of its Y-chromosomes by people with Steppe ancestry... Y-chromosome turnover was even more dramatic, as the lineages common in Copper Age Iberia (I2, G2, H) were nearly completely replaced by one lineage, R1b-M269.\"{{sfn|Olalde|2019}} }}\n\n===''The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia''===\nA genetic study published in ''Science'' in September 2019 found a large amount of WSH ancestry among Indo-European-speaking populations throughout Eurasia. This lent support to the theory that the Yamnaya people were Indo-European-speaking.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\nThe study found people of the Corded Ware, Srubnaya, Sintashta and [[Andronovo culture]]s to be a closely related group almost wholly of WSH ancestry, but with slight European Middle Neolithic admixture. These results further underpinned the notion that the Sintashta culture emerged as an eastward migration of Corded Ware peoples with mostly WSH ancestry back into the steppe. Among early WSHs, R1b is the most common Y-DNA lineage, while R1a (particularly [[Haplogroup R1a#R1a1a1b2 (R-Z93) (Asia)|R1a1a1b2]]) is common among later groups of Central Asia, such as Andronovo and Srubnaya.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\n[[West Siberian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WSGs), a distinct archaeogenetic lineage, was discovered in the study. These were found to be of about 30% EHG ancestry, 50% ANE ancestry, and 20% East Asian ancestry. It was noticed that WSHs during their expansion towards the east gained a slight (ca. 8%) admixture from WSGs.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\nIt was found that there was a significant infusion of WSH ancestry into Central Asia and South Asia during the Bronze Age. WSH ancestry was found have been almost completely absent from earlier samples in southern Central Asia in the 3rd millennium BC.{{Efn|\"Importantly, in the 3rd millennium BCE we do not find any individuals with ancestry derived from Yamnaya-related Steppe pastoralists in Turan. Thus, Steppe_EMBA ancestry was not yet widespread across the region.\"{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}} }}\n\nDuring the expansion of WSHs from Central Asia towards South Asia in the Bronze Age, an increase in South Asian agriculturalist ancestry among WSHs was noticed. Among South Asian populations, WSH ancestry is particularly high among [[Brahmin]]s and [[Bhumihar]]s. WSH ancestry was thus expected to have spread into India with the [[Vedic culture]].{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\n==Analysis==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Dnieper-Donets male (Volniensky).jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = Dnieper-Donets male (Vasil'evka III).jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 =\n\n | footer = [[Forensic facial reconstruction]]s of males from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]].

Anthony]] of the recent genetic data on WSHs was published in the [[Journal of Indo-European Studies]]. An updated version of this analysis was later published in the book ''Dispersals and Diversification: Linguistic and Archaeological Perspectives on the Early Stages of Indo-European'', by [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]. Anthony notes that WSHs display genetic continuity between the paternal lineages of the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] and the Yamnaya culture, as the males of both cultures have been found to have been mostly carriers of [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], and to a lesser extent [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} \n\nWhile the [[mtDNA]] of the Dnieper-Donets people is exclusively types of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], which is associated with EHGs and WHGs, the mtDNA of the Yamnaya also includes types frequent among CHGs and EEFs. Anthony notes that WSH had earlier been found among the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Khvalynsk culture]], who preceded the Yamnaya culture on the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. The Sredny Stog were mostly WSH with slight EEF admixture, while the Khvalynsk living further east were purely WSH. Anthony also notes that unlike their Khvalynsk predecessors, the Y-DNA of the Yamnaya is exclusively EHG and WHG. This implies that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG and WHG origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=36}} Because the slight EEF ancestry of the WSHs has been found to be derived from [[Central Europe]], and because there is no CHG Y-DNA detected among the Yamnaya, Anthony notes that it is impossible for the Maikop culture to have contributed much to the culture or CHG ancestry of the WSHs. Anthony suggests that admixture between EHGs and CHGs occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe around 5,000 BC, while admixture with EEFs happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}} On this basis, Anthony concludes that the Indo-European languages whom the WSHs brought with them were originally spoken by the EHGs of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 500\n\n | image1 = Yamnaya man 1.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = Yamnaya male (2) (1).jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 =\n\n | image3 = Yamnaya male (3) (1).jpg\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 =\n\n | footer = [[Forensic facial reconstruction]]s of three Yamnaya males, made in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s\n}}\n\nAs Yamnaya Y-DNA is exclusively of the EHG and WHG type, Anthony notes that the admixture must have occurred between EHG and WHG males, and CHG and EEF females. Anthony cites this as additional evidence that the [[Indo-European languages]] were initially spoken among EHGs living in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[Physical anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] have determined that the Yamnaya people and their successors were tall, massively built and [[Europoid]].{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007|pp=383-385}} This has been confirmed by genetic studies of WSHs, who are found to have been much taller than Neolithic populations of Central Europe. They were [[light skin]]ned, and had mostly brown eyes and brown hair.

The migration of these Western steppe herders (WSH), with the Yamnaya horizon (ca. 3300\u20132700 BCE) as their earliest representative, contributed not only to the European Corded Ware culture (ca. 2500\u20132200 BCE) but also to steppe cultures located between the Caspian Sea and the Altai-Sayan mountain region, such as the Afanasievo (ca. 3300\u20132500 BCE) and later Sintashta (2100\u20131800 BCE) and Andronovo (1800\u20131300 BCE) cultures.\"{{sfn|Jeong|2018}} }} This ancestry is often referred to as '''Yamnaya Ancestry''', '''Steppe Ancestry''' or '''Steppe-Related Ancestry'''.{{sfn|Jeong|2019}}\n\nWSHs are considered descended from [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) who received some admixture from [[Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (CHGs) during the [[Neolithic]]. The [[Y-DNA]] of the WSHs was mostly types of [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] and [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], which are EHG lineages, suggesting that CHG admixture among the WSHs came through EHG males mixing with CHG females.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}} Around 3,000 BC, people of the [[Yamnaya culture]], who belonged to the WSH cluster, embarked on a massive expansion throughout [[Eurasia]], which might have resulted in the dispersal of [[Indo-European languages]]. WSH ancestry from this period is often referred to as '''Steppe Early and Middle Bronze Age''' ('''Steppe EMBA''') ancestry.{{Efn|name=Distinction|\"We collectively refer to as \u201cWestern Steppe Herders (WSH)\u201d: the earlier populations associated with the Yamnaya and Afanasievo cultures (often called \u201csteppe Early and Middle Bronze Age\u201d; \u201csteppe_EMBA\u201d) and the later ones associated with many cultures such as Potapovka, Sintashta, Srubnaya and Andronovo to name a few (often called \u201csteppe Middle and Late Bronze Age\u201d; \u201csteppe_MLBA\u201d).\"{{sfn|Jeong|2019}} }}\n\nThis expansion led to the rise of the [[Corded Ware culture]], whose members were of about 75% WSH ancestry, and the virtual disappearance of the Y-DNA of [[Early European Farmers]] (EEFs) from the European gene pool, significantly altering the cultural and genetic landscape of Europe. During the [[Bronze Age]], Corded Ware people with admixture from Central Europe remigrated onto the steppe, forming a type of WSH ancestry often referred to as '''Steppe Middle and Late Bronze Age''' ('''Steppe MLBA''') ancestry.{{Efn|name=Distinction}} Through the [[Sintashta culture]], [[Andronovo culture]] and [[Srubnaya culture]], Steppe MLBA was carried into [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]] along with [[Indo-Iranian languages]], leaving a long-lasting cultural and genetic legacy.\n\nThe modern population of Europe can largely be modeled as a mixture of WHG ([[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]), EEF and WSH. In Europe, WSH ancestry peaks among [[Norwegians]] (ca. 50%), while in South Asia, it peaks among the [[Kalash people]] (ca. 50%) and [[Brahmins]].\n\n== Summary ==\nA summary of several genetic studies published in 2015 is given by {{Harvp|Heyd|2017}}:\n\n* Western Steppe Herders component \"is lower in southern Europe and higher in northern Europe\", where it is shared by more than 50 per cent of the current inhabitants of Norway, Lithuania and Estonia ({{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}); \n* It is linked to the migrations of [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] populations dated to ca. 3000 BCE ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}}; {{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}});\n*Genetic transmission passed from steppe Yamnaya directly to the [[Corded Ware culture|Corded Ware]]\u2013[[Single Grave culture|Single Grave]]\u2013[[Battle Axe culture|Battle Axe]] Complex ({{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}});\n*Third-millennium Europe (and prehistoric Europe in general) was \"a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacement\" ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}});\n*The Yamnaya migrations are linked to the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}}; {{harvnb|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}});\n*The plague (''[[Yersinia pestis]]'') has killed prehistoric humans in Europe during the third millennium BCE ({{harvnb|Rasmussen|Allentoft|Nielsen|Orlando|2015}}), and it stems from the Eurasian steppes;\n*Yamnaya peoples have the highest ever calculated genetic selection for stature ({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}});\n*Yamnaya peoples were fair-skinned but had dark eye colours; blue eyes were more common in the Corded Ware\u2013Single Grave\u2013Battle Axe Complex, but, the lactase persistence mutation was not yet present ({{harvnb|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015|p=}}).\n\n==Studies==\n===''Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe''===\nA ground-breaking study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 2015 found the ancestry of the people of the [[Yamnaya culture]] to be a mix of [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]] and another unidentified population. All seven Yamnaya males surveyed were found to belong to subclade [[Haplogroup R-M269|R-M269]] of [[haplogroup R1b]]. R1b had earlier been detected among EHGs living further north.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}\n\nThe study found that people of the [[Corded Ware culture]] were of approximately 75% WSH ancestry, being descended from Yamnaya people who had mixed with Middle Neolithic Europeans. This suggested that the Yamnaya people embarked on a massive expansion ca. 3,000 BC, which might have played a role in the dispersal of [[Indo-European languages]] in Europe. At this time, [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups common among [[Early European Farmers]] (EEFs), such as [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], disappear almost entirely in [[Central Europe]], and is replaced by haplotypes of R1b and [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]], which are common among WSH. EEF mtDNA decreases significantly as well, and is replaced by WSH types, suggesting that the Yamnaya expansion was carried out by both males and females. In the aftermath of the Yamnaya expansion there appears to have been a resurgence of EEF and [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] (WHG) ancestry in Central Europe, as this is detected in samples from the [[Bell Beaker culture]] and its successor the [[Unetice culture]].{{sfn|Haak|2015}} The Bell Beaker culture had about 50% WSH ancestry.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\nAll modern European populations can be modeled as a mixture of WHG, EEF and WSH. WSH ancestry is more common in [[Northern Europe]] than [[Southern Europe]]. Of modern populations surveyed in the study, [[Norwegians]] were found to have the largest amount of WSH ancestry, which among them exceeded 50%.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}\n\n===''Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in June 2015 examined the Y-DNA of five Yamnaya males. Four belonged to types of [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b1a2]], while one belonged to [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a2a1b1b]]. The study found that the Neolithic farmers of Central Europe had been \"largely replaced\" by Yamnaya people around 3,000 BC. This replacement altered not only the genetic landscape, but also the cultural landscape of Europe in many respects.{{sfn|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015}}\n\nIt was discovered that the people of the contemporary [[Afanasievo culture]] of southern [[Siberia]] were \"genetically indistinguishable\" from the Yamnaya and thus largely of WSH ancestry. People of the Corded Ware culture, the Bell Beaker culture, the Unetice culture and the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] displayed close genetic affinity to WSH. The authors of the study suggested that the [[Sintashta culture]] of [[Central Asia]] emerged as a result of an eastward migration from Central Europe of Corded Ware people with both WSH and European Neolithic farmer ancestry.{{sfn|Allentoft|Sikora|Sj\u00f6gren|Rasmussen|2015}}\n\n===''Upper Palaeolithic genomes reveal deep roots of modern Eurasians''===\nA genetic study published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' in November 2015, found that the WSHs were descended from admixture between EHGs and [[Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (CHGs). CHGs were found to have split off from WHGs ca. 43,000 BC, and to have split off from EEFs ca. 23,000 BC.{{sfn|Jones|2015}}\n\n===''Genome-wide patterns of selection in 230 ancient Eurasians''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in November 2015 found that the people of the [[Poltavka culture]], [[Potapovka culture]] and [[Srubnaya culture]] were closely related and largely of WSH descent, although the Srubnaya carried more EEF ancestry (about 17%) than the rest. Like in Yamnaya, males of Poltavka mostly carried types of R1b, while Srubnaya males carried types of R1a.({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}})\n\nThe study found that most modern Europeans could be modelled as a mixture between WHG, EEF and WSH.{{Efn|\"Most present-day Europeans can be modeled as a mixture of three ancient populations related to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (WHG), early farmers (EEF) and steppe pastoralists (Yamnaya).\"({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}}) }}\n\n===''Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in July 2016 found that WSHs were a mixture of EHGs and \"a population related to people of the Iran Chalcolithic\". EHGs were modeled as being of 75% [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) descent. A significant presence of WSH ancestry among populations of [[South Asia]] was detected. Here WSH ancestry peaked at 50% among the [[Kalash people]], which is a level similar to modern populations of Northern Europe.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}}\n\n===''Genetic Origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in August 2017 examined the genetic origins of the [[Mycenaeans]] and the [[Minoans]]. Contrary to the Minoans, the Mycenaeans were found to harbor about 15% WSH ancestry. It was found that Mycenaeans could be modelled as a mixture of WSH and Minoan ancestry. This suggests that the Mycenaeans arrived in [[Greece]] as a southern wing of the [[Indo-European migrations]].{{sfn|Lazaridis|2017}}\n\n===''The Beaker phenomenon and the genomic transformation of northwest Europe''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in February 2018 examined the entry of WSH ancestry into the [[British Isles]]. WSH ancestry was found to have been carried into the British Isles by the Bell Beaker culture in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. The migrations of Bell Beakers were accompanied with \"a replacement of ~90% of Britain's gene pool within a few hundred years\". The gene pool in the British Isles had previously been dominated by EEFs with slight WHG admixture.{{Efn|\"[M]igration played a key role in the further dissemination of the Beaker Complex, a phenomenon we document most clearly in Britain, where the spread of the Beaker Complex introduced high levels of Steppe-related ancestry and was associated with a replacement of ~90% of Britain\u2019s gene pool within a few hundred years.\"{{sfn|Olalde|2018}} }}\n\n[[Y-DNA]] in parts of the modern British Isles belongs almost entirely to [[Haplogroup R-M269|R-M269]], a WSH lineage, which is thought to have been brought to the isles with Bell Beakers.{{sfn|Olalde|2018}}\n\n===''The Genomic History of Southeastern Europe''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature'' in February 2018 noted that the modern population of Europe can largely be modeled as a mixture between EHG, WHG, WSH and EEF.{{Efn|\"It has previously been shown that the great majority of European ancestry derives from three distinct sources. First, \u201chunter-gatherer-related\u201d ancestry that is more closely related to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Europe than to any other population, and can be further subdivided into \u201cEastern\u201d (EHG) and \u201cWestern\u201d (WHG) hunter-gatherer-related ancestry.7 Second, \u201cNW Anatolian Neolithic-related\u201d ancestry related to the Neolithic farmers of northwest Anatolia and tightly linked to the appearance of agriculture. The third source, \u201csteppe-related\u201d ancestry, appears in Western Europe during the Late Neolithic to Bronze Age transition and is ultimately derived from a population related to Yamnaya steppe pastoralists. Steppe-related ancestry itself can be modeled as a mixture of EHG-related ancestry, and ancestry related to Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers of the Caucasus (CHG) and the first farmers of northern Iran.\"{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} }}\n\nThe study examined individuals from the [[Globular Amphora culture]], who bordered the Yamnaya. Globular Amphora culture people were found to have no WSH ancestry, suggesting that cultural differences and genetic differences were connected.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\nNotably, WSH ancestry was detected among two individuals buried in modern-day [[Bulgaria]] ca. 4,500 BC. This showed that WSH ancestry appeared outside of the steppe 2,000 years earlier than previously believed.{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}}\n\n===''Bronze Age population dynamics and the rise of dairy pastoralism on the eastern Eurasian steppe''===\nA genetic study published in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' in November 2018 examined the presence of WSH ancestry in the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. A number of remains from Late Bronze Age individuals buried around [[Lake Baikal]] were studied. These individuals had only 7% WSH ancestry, suggesting that pastoralism was adopted on the Eastern Steppe through cultural transmission rather than genetic displacement.{{sfn|Jeong|2018}}\n\nThe study found that WSH ancestry found among Late Bronze Age populations of the south Siberia such as the [[Karasuk culture]] was transmitted through the Andronovo culture rather than the earlier Afanasievo culture, whose genetic legacy in the region by this time was virtually non-existent.{{sfn|Jeong|2018}}\n\n===''Ancient Human Genome-Wide Data From a 3000-Year Interval in the Caucasus Corresponds with Eco-Geographic Regions''===\nA genetic study published in ''Nature Communications'' in February 2019 compared the genetic origins of the Yamnaya culture and the [[Maikop culture]]. It found that most of the EEF ancestry found among the Yamnaya culture was derived from the [[Globular Amphora culture]] and the [[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture]] of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wang|2019}}{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|p=32}} Total EEF ancestry among the Yamnaya has been estimated at 10-18%. Given the high amount of EEF ancestry in the Maikop culture, this makes it impossible for the Maikop culture to have been a major source of CHG ancestry among the WSHs. Admixture from the CHGs into the WSHs must thus have happened at an earlier date.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|p=32}}\n\n===''The genomic history of the Iberian Peninsula over the past 8000 years''===\nA genetic study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in March 2019 analyzed the process by which WSH ancestry entered the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The earliest evidence of WSH ancestry here was found from an individual living in Iberia in 2,200 BC in close proximity with native populations. By 2,000 BC, the native [[Y-DNA]] of Iberia ([[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2]] and [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]]) had been almost entirely replaced with single WSH lineage, R-M269. mtDNA in Iberia at this time was however still mostly of native origin, affirming that the entry of WSH ancestry in Iberia was primarily male-driven.{{Efn|\"We reveal sporadic contacts between Iberia and North Africa by ~2500 BCE, and by ~2000 BCE the replacement of 40% of Iberia\u2019s ancestry and nearly 100% of its Y-chromosomes by people with Steppe ancestry... Y-chromosome turnover was even more dramatic, as the lineages common in Copper Age Iberia (I2, G2, H) were nearly completely replaced by one lineage, R1b-M269.\"{{sfn|Olalde|2019}} }}\n\n===''The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia''===\nA genetic study published in ''Science'' in September 2019 found a large amount of WSH ancestry among Indo-European-speaking populations throughout Eurasia. This lent support to the theory that the Yamnaya people were Indo-European-speaking.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\nThe study found people of the Corded Ware, Srubnaya, Sintashta and [[Andronovo culture]]s to be a closely related group almost wholly of WSH ancestry, but with slight European Middle Neolithic admixture. These results further underpinned the notion that the Sintashta culture emerged as an eastward migration of Corded Ware peoples with mostly WSH ancestry back into the steppe. Among early WSHs, R1b is the most common Y-DNA lineage, while R1a (particularly [[Haplogroup R1a#R1a1a1b2 (R-Z93) (Asia)|R1a1a1b2]]) is common among later groups of Central Asia, such as Andronovo and Srubnaya.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\n[[West Siberian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WSGs), a distinct archaeogenetic lineage, was discovered in the study. These were found to be of about 30% EHG ancestry, 50% ANE ancestry, and 20% East Asian ancestry. It was noticed that WSHs during their expansion towards the east gained a slight (ca. 8%) admixture from WSGs.{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\nIt was found that there was a significant infusion of WSH ancestry into Central Asia and South Asia during the Bronze Age. WSH ancestry was found have been almost completely absent from earlier samples in southern Central Asia in the 3rd millennium BC.{{Efn|\"Importantly, in the 3rd millennium BCE we do not find any individuals with ancestry derived from Yamnaya-related Steppe pastoralists in Turan. Thus, Steppe_EMBA ancestry was not yet widespread across the region.\"{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}} }}\n\nDuring the expansion of WSHs from Central Asia towards South Asia in the Bronze Age, an increase in South Asian agriculturalist ancestry among WSHs was noticed. Among South Asian populations, WSH ancestry is particularly high among [[Brahmin]]s and [[Bhumihar]]s. WSH ancestry was thus expected to have spread into India with the [[Vedic culture]].{{sfn|Narasimhan|2019}}\n\n==Analysis==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Dnieper-Donets male (Volniensky).jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = Dnieper-Donets male (Vasil'evka III).jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 =\n\n | footer = [[Forensic facial reconstruction]]s of males from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]].

Anthony]] of the recent genetic data on WSHs was published in the [[Journal of Indo-European Studies]]. An updated version of this analysis was later published in the book ''Dispersals and Diversification: Linguistic and Archaeological Perspectives on the Early Stages of Indo-European'', by [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]. Anthony notes that WSHs display genetic continuity between the paternal lineages of the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] and the Yamnaya culture, as the males of both cultures have been found to have been mostly carriers of [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], and to a lesser extent [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} \n\nWhile the [[mtDNA]] of the Dnieper-Donets people is exclusively types of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], which is associated with EHGs and WHGs, the mtDNA of the Yamnaya also includes types frequent among CHGs and EEFs. Anthony notes that WSH had earlier been found among the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Khvalynsk culture]], who preceded the Yamnaya culture on the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. The Sredny Stog were mostly WSH with slight EEF admixture, while the Khvalynsk living further east were purely WSH. Anthony also notes that unlike their Khvalynsk predecessors, the Y-DNA of the Yamnaya is exclusively EHG and WHG. This implies that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG and WHG origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=36}} Because the slight EEF ancestry of the WSHs has been found to be derived from [[Central Europe]], and because there is no CHG Y-DNA detected among the Yamnaya, Anthony notes that it is impossible for the Maikop culture to have contributed much to the culture or CHG ancestry of the WSHs. Anthony suggests that admixture between EHGs and CHGs occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe around 5,000 BC, while admixture with EEFs happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}} On this basis, Anthony concludes that the Indo-European languages whom the WSHs brought with them were originally spoken by the EHGs of Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 500\n\n | image1 = Yamnaya man 1.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = Yamnaya male (2) (1).jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 =\n\n | image3 = Yamnaya male (3) (1).jpg\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 =\n\n | footer = [[Forensic facial reconstruction]]s of three Yamnaya males, made in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1930s\n}}\n\nAs Yamnaya Y-DNA is exclusively of the EHG and WHG type, Anthony notes that the admixture must have occurred between EHG and WHG males, and CHG and EEF females. Anthony cites this as additional evidence that the [[Indo-European languages]] were initially spoken among EHGs living in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2019a|pp=1-19}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[Physical anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] have determined that the Yamnaya people and their successors were tall, massively built and [[Europoid]].{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007|pp=383-385}} This has been confirmed by genetic studies of WSHs, who are found to have been much taller than Neolithic populations of Central Europe. They were [[light skin]]ned, and had mostly brown eyes and brown hair. It has been suggested that the increased height of modern populations of Northern Europe as compared to those of Southern Europe can be ascribed to increased WSH ancestry among Northern Europeans.{{Efn|\"[R]esults suggest that the modern South-North gradient in height across Europe is due to both increased steppe ancestry in northern populations, and selection for decreased height in Early Neolithic migrants to southern Europe.\"({{harvnb|Mathieson|Lazaridis|Rohland|Mallick|2015|p=}}) }}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Anthony |first1=David |author-link1=David W.

It is one of the [[Fair Youth]] sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of seemingly connected sonnets, from [[Sonnet 100]] to [[Sonnet 103]], in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=Paul|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets: An Original-Spelling Text|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-964207-6|page=8}}</ref> Regardless of date of writing, it was published later along with the rest of the sonnets of the [[Shakespeare's sonnets|1609 Quarto]].\n\nIn the sonnet, the poet writes of why he has stopped showering his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are a response to the infidelity of the Fair Youth in the [[Rival Poet]] sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100\u2013103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=314}}</ref>\n\n==Paraphrase==\nIn this sonnet, the speaker is explaining that though he has been writing poetry in adoration of his muse less frequently, his feelings for him are as strong as they've ever been. Gwynne Blakemore Evans believes that this is an attempt to apologize for a period of silence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blakemore Evans|first1=Gwynne|title=The Sonnets|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-29403-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/sonnets0000shak_s5k7/page/208 208]|url=https://archive.org/details/sonnets0000shak_s5k7/page/208}}</ref> The poet goes on to explain that his silence is simply him not wanting to cheapen his praise by making it common. Below is a paraphrase of the sonnet written in prose:\n\nMy love is stronger than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings in the summer and stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 102 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 8th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n\u00d7     /    \u00d7   /   \u00d7    /    \u00d7   / \u00d7   / \nAnd stops her pipe in growth of riper days. (102.8)\n</pre>\n\nThe 1st and 3rd lines have a final extrametrical syllable or ''feminine ending'':\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /   \u00d7     /    \u00d7       /     \u00d7    /   \u00d7   / (\u00d7) \nMy love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming; (102.1)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''. (\u00d7) = extrametrical syllable.\n\n==Context==\nSonnet 102 is a part of the Fair Youth sequence, and it is also connected with the surrounding sonnets ([[Sonnet 100|100]], [[Sonnet 101|101]], and [[Sonnet 103|103]]) in detailing a silence that has arisen between the poet and his muse. David West contends that this sequence may be in response to the Rival Poet sequence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=315}}</ref> The Rival Poet sequence of sonnets mention a rival for either the affections of the Fair Youth, or that they are addressing other writers that may be a \"worthier pen\" ([[Sonnet 79]]). There is a rather long list of people that scholars believe are likely candidates for the title of the fair youth addressed in the Sonnets: [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke]]; [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery]]; and [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton]] are the most common candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wait|first1=R.J.C.|title=The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets|url=https://archive.org/details/backgroundtoshak00rjcw|url-access=registration|date=1972|publisher=Schocken|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=978-1-4080-1797-5|pages=51\u201369|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been speculation of the identity of the Rival Poet.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=978-1-4080-1797-5|pages=51\u201369|edition=Revised}}</ref> [[George Chapman]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], are typically considered to be the two most likely rivals, due to their publicity, profession, relations, and standing with Shakespeare during the presumed time of writing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Levin|first1=Richard|title=Another Possible Clue To the Identity of The Rival Poet|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|date=1985|volume=36|pages=213\u2013214|doi=10.2307/2871194}}</ref>\n\n==Exegesis==\n\n===Overview===\nWhile there is no consensus as to what specifically has caused the silence that has grown between the speaker and his muse, sonnet 102 seems to be an attempt to mend the relationship by claiming that he still loves as strongly as he ever has. Katherine Duncan-Jones has given the following overview: \"Still claiming to have fallen silent, the poet claims that he loves just as much, though he shows it less, for fear of wearisome repetition.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n===Quatrain 1===\nIn the first quatrain the poet describes that he has become quiet about the love he has for his muse, but this does not mean that his love is less. Rather, he claims that it is for the exact opposite reason. Carl Aitkins feels that the tone established here is like an tangential thought from [[Sonnet 100]] and [[Sonnet 101]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aitkins|first1=Carl D.|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary|date=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson UP|location=Madison, NJ|page=254}}</ref> Publishing sonnets about his love have become a kind of currency.

He uses seasonal imagery to set up his atmosphere, which he continues to use in line three, where we also encounter an allusion to the myth of [[Philomela]], which can be a poetic name for the [[nightingale]].\nIn Ovid's Metamorphoses, the myth of Philomela involves Tereus, the King of Thrace, who kidnaps his wife's sister, Philomela, and then he rapes her and cuts out her tongue to silence her.<ref>Allen Mandelbaum (translator). Ovid. ''The Metamorphoses of Ovid'' (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1993) Book VI.</ref>\nThere is contention among scholars as to whether Shakespeare actively utilizes the Philomela allusion, Stephen Booth contends that there is \"no active reference to Philomela.\" This is to say that Stephen Booth feels that Shakespeare is not invoking Philomela for any reason beyond the poetic name for the nightingale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Stephen|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=330}}</ref> In ''A Moving Rhetoricke,'' however, Christina Luckyj contends that the Shakespeare views the Fair Youth's silence as a violation of the same magnitude as Tereus's rape of Philomela, and the cause of the poet's silence. Since his lover has betrayed him in favor of the Rival Poet, he chooses to silence himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luckyj|first1=Christina|title=A Moving Rhetoricke|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7190-6156-3|page=169}}</ref>\n\nOn line 8, \"His\" is the word which appears in the original 1609 Quarto. Katherine Duncan-Jones has edited this to become \"her,\" as many scholars think that \"his\" may be a misreading of the manuscript, which may have read \"hir\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref> This change is frequently made by editors, as Philomel is referred to as feminine throughout the rest of the sonnet.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pooler|first1=C.Knox|title=The Works of Shakespeare|date=1918|publisher=Arden Shakespeare}}</ref> However, there are scholars who defend the use of \"his\". Stephen Booth simply contends that this is done to move away from the mythological allusion and focuses on the nightingale: It is the male nightingale that sings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Stephen|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=330}}</ref> While David West also offers a defense of the use of \"his,\" his reasoning differs greatly from Booth. West contends that Shakespeare used his for a variety of reasons, among his reasons being to avoid \" the embarrassment of comparing [his lover] to a female.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=316}}</ref> Another reason defense put forth by West is a difference in language. In Elizabethan times, his was used as a neutral pronoun, often used where a modern writer would use \"its\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=316}}</ref><ref>{{Cite OED | his }}</ref>\n\n===Quatrain 3===\nThe third quatrain continues the metaphor of the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further stress that the poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain that just because he does not flatter the Fair Youth, does not mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, \"too much praise ceases to please\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Critical Survey of Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2014|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-1-61925-499-2|page=105}}</ref> The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as \"pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref> This is a usage of another common proverb; \"Too much familiarity breeds contempt.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tilley|first1=Morris Palmer|title=A dictionary of the proverbs in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries : a collection of the proverbs found in English literature and the dictionaries of the period.|date=1950|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=201}}</ref>\n\n===Couplet===\nThe couplet summarizes the sonnet in two lines, \"Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue, because I would not dull you with my song\". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time that he will not dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref> In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: \"My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you.\" Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Stephen|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=331}}</ref> Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aitkins|first1=Carl D.|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary|date=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson UP|location=Madison, NJ|page=254}}</ref> Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vendler|first1=Helen|title=The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets|url=https://archive.org/details/artofshakespeare00vend|url-access=registration|date=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/artofshakespeare00vend/page/436 436]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Shakespeare sonnets bibliography}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/sonnet/102 Shakespeare's Sonnets]: An online library of Shakespeare's Sonnets.\n\n{{Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare's sonnets}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonnet 102}}\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare]]\n", "text_old": "{{Sonnet|102|Sonnet 102 1609.jpg|Sonnet 102 in the 1609 Quarto of Shakespeare's sonnets|\nMy love is strengthen\u2019d, though more weak in seeming;\nI love not less, though less the show appear:\nThat love is merchandiz\u2019d whose rich esteeming\nThe owner\u2019s tongue doth publish every where.\nOur love was new, and then but in the spring,\nWhen I was wont to greet it with my lays;\nAs Philomel in summer\u2019s front doth sing,\nAnd stops her pipe in growth of riper days:\nNot that the summer is less pleasant now\nThan when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\nBut that wild music burthens every bough,\nAnd sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\n:Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue,\n:Because I would not dull you with my song.\n|source=<ref>{{cite book |title=The Works of Shakespeare: Sonnets |editor-first=C[harles] Knox |editor-last=Pooler |series=The Arden Shakespeare [1st series] |location=London |publisher=Methuen & Company |date=1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/sonnetseditedbyc00shakuoft |oclc=4770201}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Sonnet 102''' is one of the 154 [[sonnet]]s written by English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]].

Gwynne Blakemore Evans believes that this is an attempt to apologize for a period of silence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blakemore Evans|first1=Gwynne|title=The Sonnets|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-29403-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/sonnets0000shak_s5k7/page/208 208]|url=https://archive.org/details/sonnets0000shak_s5k7/page/208}}</ref> The poet goes on to explain that his silence is simply him not wanting to cheapen his praise by making it common. Below is a paraphrase of the sonnet written in prose:\n\nMy love is stronger than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings in the summer and stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 102 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 8th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n\u00d7     /    \u00d7   /   \u00d7    /    \u00d7   / \u00d7   / \nAnd stops her pipe in growth of riper days. (102.8)\n</pre>\n\nThe 1st and 3rd lines have a final extrametrical syllable or ''feminine ending'':\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /   \u00d7     /    \u00d7       /     \u00d7    /   \u00d7   / (\u00d7) \nMy love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming; (102.1)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''. (\u00d7) = extrametrical syllable.\n\n==Context==\nSonnet 102 is a part of the Fair Youth sequence, and it is also connected with the surrounding sonnets ([[Sonnet 100|100]], [[Sonnet 101|101]], and [[Sonnet 103|103]]) in detailing a silence that has arisen between the poet and his muse. David West contends that this sequence may be in response to the Rival Poet sequence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=315}}</ref> The Rival Poet sequence of sonnets mention a rival for either the affections of the Fair Youth, or that they are addressing other writers that may be a \"worthier pen\" ([[Sonnet 79]]). There is a rather long list of people that scholars believe are likely candidates for the title of the fair youth addressed in the Sonnets: [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke]]; [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery]]; and [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton]] are the most common candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wait|first1=R.J.C.|title=The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets|url=https://archive.org/details/backgroundtoshak00rjcw|url-access=registration|date=1972|publisher=Schocken|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=978-1-4080-1797-5|pages=51\u201369|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been speculation of the identity of the Rival Poet.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=978-1-4080-1797-5|pages=51\u201369|edition=Revised}}</ref> [[George Chapman]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], are typically considered to be the two most likely rivals, due to their publicity, profession, relations, and standing with Shakespeare during the presumed time of writing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Levin|first1=Richard|title=Another Possible Clue To the Identity of The Rival Poet|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|date=1985|volume=36|pages=213\u2013214|doi=10.2307/2871194}}</ref>\n\n==Exegesis==\n\n===Overview===\nWhile there is no consensus as to what specifically has caused the silence that has grown between the speaker and his muse, sonnet 102 seems to be an attempt to mend the relationship by claiming that he still loves as strongly as he ever has. Katherine Duncan-Jones has given the following overview: \"Still claiming to have fallen silent, the poet claims that he loves just as much, though he shows it less, for fear of wearisome repetition.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n===Quatrain 1===\nIn the first quatrain the poet describes that he has become quiet about the love he has for his muse, but this does not mean that his love is less. Rather, he claims that it is for the exact opposite reason. Carl Aitkins feels that the tone established here is like an tangential thought from [[Sonnet 100]] and [[Sonnet 101]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aitkins|first1=Carl D.|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary|date=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson UP|location=Madison, NJ|page=254}}</ref> Publishing sonnets about his love have become a kind of currency.

He uses seasonal imagery to set up his atmosphere, which he continues to use in line three, where we also encounter an allusion to the myth of [[Philomela]], which can be a poetic name for the [[nightingale]].\nIn Ovid's Metamorphoses, the myth of Philomela involves Tereus, the King of Thrace, who kidnaps his wife's sister, Philomela, and then he rapes her and cuts out her tongue to silence her.<ref>Allen Mandelbaum (translator). Ovid. ''The Metamorphoses of Ovid'' (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1993) Book VI.</ref>\nThere is contention among scholars as to whether Shakespeare actively utilizes the Philomela allusion, Stephen Booth contends that there is \"no active reference to Philomela.\" This is to say that Stephen Booth feels that Shakespeare is not invoking Philomela for any reason beyond the poetic name for the nightingale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Stephen|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=330}}</ref> In ''A Moving Rhetoricke,'' however, Christina Luckyj contends that the Shakespeare views the Fair Youth's silence as a violation of the same magnitude as Tereus's rape of Philomela, and the cause of the poet's silence. Since his lover has betrayed him in favor of the Rival Poet, he chooses to silence himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Luckyj|first1=Christina|title=A Moving Rhetoricke|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7190-6156-3|page=169}}</ref>\n\nOn line 8, \"His\" is the word which appears in the original 1609 Quarto. Katherine Duncan-Jones has edited this to become \"her,\" as many scholars think that \"his\" may be a misreading of the manuscript, which may have read \"hir\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref> This change is frequently made by editors, as Philomel is referred to as feminine throughout the rest of the sonnet.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pooler|first1=C.Knox|title=The Works of Shakespeare|date=1918|publisher=Arden Shakespeare}}</ref> However, there are scholars who defend the use of \"his\". Stephen Booth simply contends that this is done to move away from the mythological allusion and focuses on the nightingale: It is the male nightingale that sings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Stephen|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=330}}</ref> While David West also offers a defense of the use of \"his,\" his reasoning differs greatly from Booth. West contends that Shakespeare used his for a variety of reasons, among his reasons being to avoid \" the embarrassment of comparing [his lover] to a female.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=316}}</ref> Another reason defense put forth by West is a difference in language. In Elizabethan times, his was used as a neutral pronoun, often used where a modern writer would use \"its\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=David|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2007|publisher=Duckworth Overlook|location=London|isbn=978-1-58567-921-8|page=316}}</ref><ref>{{Cite OED | his }}</ref>\n\n===Quatrain 3===\nThe third quatrain continues the metaphor of the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further stress that the poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain that just because he does not flatter the Fair Youth, does not mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, \"too much praise ceases to please\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Critical Survey of Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2014|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-1-61925-499-2|page=105}}</ref> The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as \"pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref> This is a usage of another common proverb; \"Too much familiarity breeds contempt.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tilley|first1=Morris Palmer|title=A dictionary of the proverbs in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries : a collection of the proverbs found in English literature and the dictionaries of the period.|date=1950|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=201}}</ref>\n\n===Couplet===\nThe couplet summarizes the sonnet in two lines, \"Therefore, like her, I sometime hold my tongue, because I would not dull you with my song\". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time that he will not dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=314|edition=Revised}}</ref> In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: \"My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you.\" Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Stephen|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=331}}</ref> Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aitkins|first1=Carl D.|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary|date=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson UP|location=Madison, NJ|page=254}}</ref> Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vendler|first1=Helen|title=The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets|url=https://archive.org/details/artofshakespeare00vend|url-access=registration|date=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/artofshakespeare00vend/page/436 436]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Shakespeare sonnets bibliography}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/sonnet/102 Shakespeare's Sonnets]: An online library of Shakespeare's Sonnets.\n\n{{Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare's sonnets}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonnet 102}}\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 100-103 \u2192 100\u2013103", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_102"}

It was founded by Gurak, off-shooting from the [[Kamarupa Kingdom|Kamarupa Empire]]'s [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in 630 AD. The Kings of Gour are described as patrons of [[Hinduism|Hindu revivalism]] in what was previously a predominantly Buddhist and animist populated land. The 11th century king, Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva is recognised for introducing the ''navadinga'' (nine war boats) and heavily improving the kingdom's infantry, cavalry, and elephant power.<ref name=gupta/> Due to familial tensions, the kingdom split into two separate kingdoms in 1170; '''Gour''' (Northern Sylhet) and '''Brahmachal''' (Southern Sylhet), before being reunited by [[Raja Govardhan]] in the early years of his reign. However, this would be short-lasted as during Govardhan's reign, the kingdom would suffer attacks from neighbouring kingdoms of all directions; eventually leading to the latter's death and the annexation of Brahmachal from Gour to [[Twipra Kingdom|Twipra]]. [[Gour Govinda]] would be the last king to succeed him. In contrast to Govardhan, he would revive Gour back into a regional superpower, warding off all potential enemies, regaining lost territory, introducing defensive strategies like [[archery]] in war for the first time in [[Bengal]]'s history and improving Gour's military status.<ref name=potro/> Noted as a disrespectful and intolerant tyrant, Gour Govinda oppressed religious minorities living in his kingdom, in particular the followers of [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]] and certain [[Hindu denominations]]. The kingdom came to an end after the Islamic [[conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303 led by [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and [[Shah Jalal]], leading to the flight of Govinda and the royal family, and the subsequent incorporation of Sylhet with mainland Muslim [[Bengal]] ruled by Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firuz Shah]].<ref name=\"Session1980\">{{cite book|author=North East India History Association.

Some say that the name originated from the kingdom's founder; Gurak, the son of Raja Guhak just as Jaintia was named after Jayantak and [[Laur Kingdom|Laur]] after Ladduk. Other theories are that it was named following the 1170 partition of the kingdom into two. The north was renamed Gour (also transliterated as Gauda in [[Sanskrit]]) as in imitation of the great Hindu [[Gauda Kingdom]] which ruled [[Bengal]] from 590AD to 626AD.<ref name=back/>\n\n==Location and origin==\nThe kingdom consisted of majority of the modern-day [[Sylhet District]]. It included some eastern parts of the modern-day [[Moulvibazar District]] until it split from Gour to become the independent kingdom of Brahmachal. The final king of Gour, [[Gour Govinda]] would reunite Brahmachal to the Gour Kingdom. The [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal kingdom]], to its southwest, was  a vassal state of Gour, and later Brahmachal would be one as well. With Govinda turning Gour into a regional superpower, the [[Laur Kingdom]] may have also been a vassal state as Takerghat (in Laur) was made the naval headquarters during Govinda's rule. In the 850s, much of the kingdom's territory was described to be \"outside the pale of human habitation\" with central and southwestern Sylhet forming a large sea.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brahmanic Settlements in Different Subdivisions of Ancient Bengal|publisher=Indian Studies: Past & Present|year=1967|last=Niyogi|first=Puspa|page=41}}</ref> This explains the naval significance which the Kings of Gour boasted.<ref>{{cite journal|first=K.

The small tribe remains in existence today and are also known by their endonym, the Laleng, and claim descent from these kings. Their traditions are a mixture of tribal animistic and Hindu beliefs. They have a distinct language to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] and many migrated to [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]] following the 1947 [[Partition of India]] and 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Patra, The|author=Khan, Sadat Ullah}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Xuanzang w.jpg|thumb|[[Xuanzang]] was a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled to Sheelachatal (Sylhet) in the seventh century.]]\nBefore the establishment of the Gour Kingdom, the area was a part of [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintia]] in the greater [[Kamarupa Kingdom]]. When Guhak ascended the Jaintia throne, he married a princess from Kamarupa. Guhak had a deep interest in [[Hinduism]] and migration of [[Brahmins]] from the [[Kamrup region]] to this area took place. On his way back, Guhak brought a stone image known as ''Kangsa-Nisudhana'', an image of [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] murdering [[Kamsa]], as well as Grivakali and Janghakali, and they put it on top of a hill in modern-day where they would worship it. During the British colonial period, this hill was also home to the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow.<ref name=back/>\n\nGuhak had three sons; Jayantak, Gurak and Ladduk, and two daughters; Sheela and Chatala. It is said that his eldest daughter, Sheela, was once bathing in a lake south of the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule) and she was kidnapped. After being rescued by Guhak, Sheela started to become more religious and live a secluded life. Chatala indulged herself in an unlawful relationship with one of the palace servants, leading to her being disowned and dumped in a distant island in the middle of 2000 square mile lake to the south of the kingdom. After Sheela's death at a young age, Guhak gave up his kingdom to also lead a more ascetic life. This port-area around the lake, which was the largest centre in the Jaintia Kingdom for trade, was named Sheela [[haat]] (or Sheela's marketplace) in her honour. Sources such as the Hattanath Tales mention Sheelachatal was named after both daughters for the region.<ref name=fazlur/> This is one of many theories of how [[Sylhet]] got its name.<ref>see [[Names of Sylhet]]</ref> [[Xuanzang]] of [[China]] mentions that he visited Sheelachatal in the 630s in his book, the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]''. He split the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] into three for his three sons. He gave his eldest son, Jayantak, what would become the hilly [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. He gave his second son, Gurak, the southern plains which would be named Gour, and he gave his third son, Luddak, the western plains which would become the [[Laur Kingdom]].<ref name=pak/>\n\nGurak made the capital initially at Borchola, 5 miles northwest of modern-day [[Sylhet]], but moved it to Malini stream bank, 7 miles south of Sylhet. He appointed Marbel as his chief minister. The minister was stationed in a hillock (now known as [[Mona Rai]]'s Tila) near [[Sylhet|the port]] for ease in tax collection and civil duties.<ref name=back>{{cite book|first=Rajmohan|last=Nath|title=The back-ground of Assamese culture|pages=113|url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.34829/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1948|publisher=A. K. Nath|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Mass migration period===\nBeing separated from [[Kamarupa]] by the [[Jaintia Kingdom]], Gour started interacting more with the Hindu lands to its west such as Tripura and Prayagraj. Minister Marbel was ordered to find a wife for Gurak's son, Srihasta. He went south to the [[Twipra Kingdom]] in eastern Bengal where he found a young princess for Srihasta. When Srihasta ascended the throne in 660, he too contributed to the increase of [[Hindu]] influence to the predominantly [[Tantric Buddhist]] and animist-populated land. He installed a stone [[Shivalingam]], which he called Bateshwar Shiva, in modern-day Bondor Bazar which he obtained during a pilgrimage to [[Akshayavat]] in [[Prayagraj]]. It is said he did this to compete with the Buddhist Lokenath statue which a group of merchants installed in modern-day Kazir Bazar. Gour also bordered Bengal to the west which was ruled by the Buddhist [[Pala Empire]]. The Buddhist and later Muslim rule in Bengal led to large numbers of [[Hindus]] to migrate to Gour, which was considered a Hindu stronghold. Srihasta's reign ended in 690 AD and he was succeeded by Kritti Pal. The names of the four kings who succeeded Kritti Pal is unknown until 870 AD, when Bhut Vishnudeva ascends the throne as the 7th king of Gour. He was known to have been [[Muteness|mute]]. He was succeeded by Navagirvan Deva (also known as Ananta Deva Navagirvanta) who is mentioned in the Bhatera copper-plate inscription as Kharavana. The Bhatera copper-plate inscription mentions the rulers of Gour from Navagirvan upto Kesava Deva. Navagirvan is attributed for bringing prosperity to Srihatta. His son, Gokul Kishore Deva was described in the inscription to be so strong that he imposed inactivity to enemy kingdoms. Gokul's son, Narayana Deva had a minister named Nandaka and a son named Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva.<ref name=bhatera1>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/epigrahiaindicav014768mbp/page/n365/|last=Gupta|first=Prof Dr K M|location=[[Sylhet]]|journal=[[Epigraphia Indica]]|title=49.

The elder son, Jadava was meant to be king though he was said to have been childless and diseased, and so his brother, Kangsa Narayan became the next king instead. Kangsa established a [[satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|satra]] in the memory of his father, and dug Kamala Lake in memory of his mother, Kamala. Kangsa's rule was very short as he was killed by a wild elephant at a young age. His newly-wed and pregnant wife, Kalavati, a princess from [[Bihar]], became the queen regent with Prince Ishan Deva, General Viradatta and Minister Vanamali Kar managing the kingdom. Kalavati gave birth to a son who was named Pravir Deva. To celebrate Pravir's birth, Ishan installed the [[Madhu-Kaitabha]]ri Temple - which contained an image of [[Vishnu]] - on a hillock now known as Manik Pir's hill.<ref name=fazlur/> The installation ceremony was conducted by a group of [[Brahmins]] and they were rewarded by the administration by receiving excessive land grants in the kingdom. Pravir Deva became the Raja of Gour when he reached a mature age in 1080 AD. He had a son named Bhujavir.\n\n===Partition===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Brahmachal infiltration\n| date       = 1253\n| place      = Brahmachal palace (Baramchal, [[Kulaura]])\n| territory  = [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] re-annexed to Gour\n| result     = Amar Singh replaces Upananda as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = [[Brahmachal Kingdom]]\n----\n{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Twipra Kingdom]] (''defector'')\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n| commander2 = '''Raja Upananda'''{{KIA}}\n* Commander [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] (''defector'')\n* Minister (name unknown)\n* [[Jaidev Rai]] (minister's son)\n----{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]] (''defector'')\n| }}\nIn 1140 AD, after the death of Bhujavir Deva, his son Kshetra Pal ascended the throne. Raja Kshetra Pal also practised [[polygyny]] and had two wives; Ratnavati and Surama. During his reign, an earthquake took place which changed the country's contour and topography. It is said that a new river emerged in the town, which the King named after his second and favourite wife, Rani Surama, as the [[Surma River]]. The King's first son came from Surama and his name was Brahmajit. A few years later, Kshetra's first wife Ratnavati also gave birth to a son, called Dharmadhwaj. However, conspiracies emerged in the country as a number of people were suspicious of Ratnavati accusing her of jealousy and child illegitimacy as Kshetra was an old man by this time. After Kshetra died, his eldest son, Brahmajit stepped to the throne. His stepmother Ratnavati and her associates gave Brahmajit a hard time as she believed that as she was the elder wife, her son should have been the King.\n\nScared for his life, Brahmajit moved his capital to a place known as Brahmachal (now Baramchal, [[Kulaura]]), just north of the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. He then appointed his stepbrother Dharmadhwaj to govern over the old capital, which retained its name as Gour. Conflict did not emerge as both rulers thought that they were in control of the kingdom as a whole, but gradually the two lands split to become two different kingdoms; Gour and [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] in 1170 AD. The two stepsons worked together and hosted a [[Vedic]] [[yajna]] at the Bhatera Homer Tila at Brahmachal which was arranged by Nidhipati Shastri, who was a descendant of Ananda Shastri - a [[Brahmin]] from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] who arrived in Sylhet during the rule of Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva. Another yajna was hosted by Raja Sengkwchak Dharmadhar of the [[Twipra Kingdom]] with Nidhipati as a priest as well who was rewarded with what would become the Ita Kingdom. Dharmadhwaj of Gour died in 1200, and was succeeded by his son, Rajadhwaj who ruled until his death in 1230 in which his son, Gouradhwaj Bhabananda took the throne.\n\n===Civil war===\n[[Raja Govardhan]] rose to power in 1250 following the death of his father, Gouradhwaj. During this period, Upananda was the King of [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]]. The long-lasted conflict between the north and south continued during Govardhan's reign. Govardhan appointed his chief minister, [[Madan Rai]], to somehow find a way to lure Upananda's general, [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]], to use him as a tool to infiltrate Brahmachal, as Govardhan was not fond of Upananda. Govardhan and Rai then made an agreement with Govardhan's general Virabhadra to give his daughter, Chandrakala, in marriage to Singh. The marriage was successful, despite protests, and Singh maintained a good relationship with General Virabhadra and a developing relationship with the Gour royal court. Singh had close ties with the [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]], the border guards for the [[Twipra Kingdom]] south of Brahmachal. He managed to persuade the Kuki chiefs into raiding Raja Upananda's palace in the dead of the night, massacring most of its inmates. With the emergence of a civil war between Brahmachal and Gour, Raja Upananda was subsequently killed. Brahmachal became a part of the Gour kingdom again, and Govardhan appointed [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] as its feudal governor. Babysat by the Upananda's older sister-in-law, Anna Purna, thirteen royal children managed to flee to the jungles where they stumbled across Giridhari, a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] [[sannyasi]], Giridhari took them to [[Kamakhya Temple]] where they were trained into hermitage and would return to Gour a few years later during the tribal invasion.\n\n===Conflict with Tungachal===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Tungachal conflict\n| date       = 1258\n| place      = Banks of Ghungi Jurir Haor, Tungachal\n| territory  = [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal]] secured to Gour administration\n| result     = Shandul replaces Epivishnu as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = Tungachal Kingdom\n----Brahmachal remnant officers\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n* [[Amar Singh (general)|Raja Amar Singh]]{{KIA}}\n| commander2 = '''Raja Epivishnu'''{{KIA}}\n* General Raghu{{POW}}\n* Minister Bhadra Janardan\n| }}\n[[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] which was ruled by Upananda contained the territory of Tungachal. In effect, this meant that the feudal ruler of Tungachal, Epivishnu - who was not given a choice - was effectively under the control of [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Having close ties with Brahmachal and Tripura, Epivishnu was adamant to Govardhan and Singh's amicable compromises. With Epivishnu refusing every pleasant proposal given to be a feudal ruler under Gour, Govardhan and Singh decided it was time that they dethrone Epivishnu and appoint someone else to govern Tungachal. The Gour forces entered Tungachal, and a battle emerged on the banks of the Ghungi Jurir Haor. Raja Epivishnu was murdered and his commander-in-chief General Raghu was kidnapped and taken as a captive back to Gour. Govardhan then appointed his second general, Shandul, to be the feudal ruler of Tungachal.\n\n===Tribal invasion===\nThe Raja of the [[Twipra Kingdom]], Ratan Manikya was informed of Singh's treacherous actions and how he tricked the Kuki chiefs, he decided that he takes actions. He was also told of the murder of Raja Epivishnu, whom he was a friend of. Ratan believed the Gour administration was going too far and decided to also put a stop to Govardhan's craving of invading neighbouring kingdoms. He sent a contingent towards Brahmachal to attack [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Singh's forces were outnumbered, and requested assistance from Govardhan. However, Govardhan was unable to help as Gour was facing an invasion in the north from the [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. Singh was killed by the Tripura forces and the Kuki chiefs saw this as an opportunity for them to annex Brahmachal to the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. [[Jaidev Rai]], son of the minister of Raja Upananda, who was the king of Brahmachal before Amar Singh, was made the feudal ruler under the Tripuris. The [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s then proceeded to Tungachal, in an attempt to dethrone Shandul. Shandul decided to flee to Gour, thus enabling the Tripuris to bloodlessly annex Tungachal to its kingdom as well. The former minister of Tungachal, Bhadra Janardan, was appointed as the feudal ruler of Tungachal under the Twipra Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Jaintia Kingdom]], north of Gour, attempted to invade and annex Gour to its kingdom as they could see that Govardhan was focused on the insurgencies in the southern areas of his kingdom and on securing Brahmachal and Tungachal. The various indigenous tribes and neighbouring kingdoms including the [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s, [[Kuki people|Kuki]]s, [[Kachari people|Kachari]]s and [[Naga people|Naga]]s joined forces with the [[Pnar people|Pnar]] and [[Khasi people|Khasi]] of the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in attacking Northern Sylhet. Being attacked from both north and south directions, and having no support from neighbouring states, Govardhan was dethroned and killed in battle. However, the thirteen royals of Brahmachal who had fled to [[Kamakhya Temple|Kamakhya]] during the civil war, had returned to Gour, guided by Giridhari, after receiving military training, religious and magical education from the [[Kamrup region]] for a number of years.<ref name=heads>{{cite book|title=Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division|chapter=Sylhet District|pages=290|url=https://archive.org/details/principalheadsh00unkngoog/page/n303|year=1868|location=[[Calcutta]]|author=E M Lewis|publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sylheterdak.com.bd/details.php?id=5780|title=\u09b8\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7\u099f\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u099a\u09c0\u09a8 \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09cd\u09af \u09b8\u09ae\u09c1\u09b9|language=bn|date=1 Feb 2017|publisher=Sylheter Dak}}</ref> Being led by Upananda's nephew, [[Gour Govinda]], they defeated the rebels; warding them all off and recapturing Gour.<ref name=back/> Govardhan's heir, [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]], was still a minor and so the queen-mother Apurna consented to Govinda being the King of Gour.<ref name=pak/>\n\n===Restoration===\n[[File:05122009 Hill of Raja Gour Govinda Sylhet photo2 Ranadipam Basu.jpg|thumb|The hill of Raja Gour Govinda in Chowhatta, Sylhet.]]\n[[Gour Govinda]] dramatically restored Gour's reputation as a regional superpower by constructing forts all over his kingdom, guarding his kingdom with large stones (shil; from which the name Shilhot/Sylhet is theorised to have come from) and establishing a number of military training camps.

They gained some authority in the kingdom, being favoured by Govinda over the native Hindus for their religious orthodoxy. The elitist Brahmins cooperatively led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over during the reign of Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s (''untouchables'') of the lowest social status. The Brahmins from [[Central India]] brought by Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva, were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class \"Govinda Brahmins\" as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\nA small number of [[Muslims|Muslim families]] from neighbouring Bengal also settled in Gour, possibly following [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]]'s 1254 [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Invasion]]. One day, [[Ghazi Burhanuddin]] - who lived with his family in Tultikar -  sacrificed a cow for the [[aqiqah]] of his newborn son, Gulzar Alam. [[Gour Govinda]], in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn killed as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off. Shortly after this incident, Qadi Nuruddin of Taraf celebrated his son's marriage ceremony by slaughtering a cow for them to eat. The Qadi was executed by the feudal ruler Achak Narayan. After both men being punished, Burhanuddin and Nuruddin's brother, Halimuddin, travelled to lower Bengal where they addressed their issue with Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]]. This marked the start of the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303, with the Sultan appointing his nephew, [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], to lead an army against the Raja. A number of battles took place, with Govinda managing to defeat the Muslims of Bengal. However, in the final battle, Govinda fled with his family following the arrival of the warrior-saint [[Shah Jalal]] and his companions, numbering over three hundred. [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]] was appointed the first Wazir of Sylhet, and Tungachal would subsequently be captured off Achak Narayan in the following year by [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and his 12 [[lascar]]s.\nghaturam\n\n==List of rulers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Titular Name\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Reign\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Officers\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Notes\n|-\n| Gurak (\u0997\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u0995)\n| 630-660\n| Marbel (chief minister)\n| Son of Raja Guhak of greater Jaintia who split his kingdom into three; giving a third to Gurak.\n|-\n| Srihasta (\u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0\u09b9\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4)\n| 660-690\n| \n| 2nd Raja, Son of Raja Gurak; married a [[Tripuri people|Tripuri princess]]\n|-\n| Kritti Pal (\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf\u09aa\u09be\u09b2)\n| 690-720\n|\n| 3rd Raja, Son of Srihasta\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"| Unknown rulers (720-870)\n|-\n| Bhut Vishnudeva (\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b7\u09cd\u09a3\u09c1\u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 870-900\n|\n| 7th Raja\n|-\n| Navagirvan Kharavana Dev (\u09a8\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09b0\u09ac\u09be\u09a3 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 900-930\n|\n| 8th Raja, son of Bhut\n|-\n| Gokul Kishore (\u0997\u09cb\u0995\u09c1\u09b2 \u0995\u09bf\u09b6\u09cb\u09b0)\n| 930-960\n|\n| 9th Raja, son of Navagirvan\n|-\n| Narayan Deva (\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u09af\u09bc\u09a3 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 960-990\n|\n| 10th Raja, son of Gokul\n|-\n| Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva (\u0997\u09cb\u09ac\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6 \u09b0\u09a3 \u0995\u09c7\u09b6\u09ac \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 990-1040\n| Kamala and Chandana (queens), Jadava, Kangsa and Ishan (princes)\n| 11th Raja, son of Narayan\n|-\n| Kangsa Narayan (\u0995\u0982\u09b8 \u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u09af\u09bc\u09a3)\n| 1040-1060\n| Kalavati (queen), \n| 12th Raja, son of Govinda and Kamala\n|-\n| Ishan Deva (\u0988\u09b6\u09be\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 1060-1080\n| Vanamali Kar (chief minister), Viradatta (commander), Kalavati (queen-regent)\n| 13th ruler (acting), son of Govinda and Chandana\n|-\n| Pravir Deva (\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09b0 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 1080-1100 \n| Vanamali Kar (chief minister), Viradatta (commander), Kalavati (queen-mother)\n| 14th Raja, son of Kangsa Narayan\n|-\n| Bhujavir (\u09ad\u09c1\u099c\u09ac\u09c0\u09b0 or \u09ad\u09c2\u099c\u09ac\u09c0\u09b0)\n| 1100-1140\n| Kshetra Pal (prince)\n| 15th Raja, son of Pravir\n|-\n| Kshetra Pal (\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09c7\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09aa\u09be\u09b2)\n| 1140-1170\n| Ratnavati and Surama (queens), Dharmadhwaj and Rajadhwaj (princes)\n| 16th Raja, son of Bhujavir\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"| Partition of Gour\n|-\n| Dharmadhwaj (\u09a7\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c)\n| 1170-1200\n| Ruled Gour, alongside Brahmajit who moved to Brahmachal\n| 17th Raja, son of Kshetra and Ratnavati\n|-\n| Rajadhwaj (\u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c)\n| 1200-1230\n| \n| 18th Raja, son of Dharmadhwaj\n|-\n| Gouradhwaj Bhabananda (\u0997\u09cc\u09a1\u09bc\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c \u09ad\u09ac\u09be\u09a8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6)\n| 1230-1250\n|\n| 19th Raja, son of Rajadhwaj\n|-\n| [[Govardhan of Gour|Gangadhwaj Govardhan]] (\u0997\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c \u0997\u09cb\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09a8)\n| 1250-1260\n| [[Madan Rai]] (chief minister), Apurna (queen), Virabhadra (commander-in-chief), Shandul (Tungachal governor), [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]] (heir-apparent), [[Amar Singh (general)|Raja Amar Singh]] (Brahmachal governor)\n| 20th Raja, son of Gouradhwaj Bhabananda\n|-\n| [[Gour Govinda]] (\u0997\u09cc\u09a1\u09bc \u0997\u09cb\u09ac\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6)\n| 1260-1303\n| [[Mona Rai]] (chief minister), Chakrapani Dutta (commander), Hiravati (queen), Apurna (queen-mother), Achak Narayan (Tungachal governor), [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]] and Nirvana (princes), Shantipriya (princess)\n| 21st Raja, defended Gour during Jaintia invasion, descendant of Brahmajit\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"| Islamic [[Conquest of Gour]], end of Gour Kingdom\n|}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1877, two copper-plate inscriptions were discovered in the Itertilla or Homer Tila mound in the estate of Babu Jagachchandra Deb Choudhury in the village of Bhatera.

It was founded by Gurak, off-shooting from the [[Kamarupa Kingdom|Kamarupa Empire]]'s [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in 630 AD. The Kings of Gour are described as patrons of [[Hinduism|Hindu revivalism]] in what was previously a predominantly Buddhist and animist populated land. The 11th century king, Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva is recognised for introducing the ''navadinga'' (nine war boats) and heavily improving the kingdom's infantry, cavalry, and elephant power.<ref name=gupta/> Due to familial tensions, the kingdom split into two separate kingdoms in 1170; '''Gour''' (Northern Sylhet) and '''Brahmachal''' (Southern Sylhet), before being reunited by [[Raja Govardhan]] in the early years of his reign. However, this would be short-lasted as during Govardhan's reign, the kingdom would suffer attacks from neighbouring kingdoms of all directions; eventually leading to the latter's death and the annexation of Brahmachal from Gour to [[Twipra Kingdom|Twipra]]. [[Gour Govinda]] would be the last king to succeed him. In contrast to Govardhan, he would revive Gour back into a regional superpower, warding off all potential enemies, regaining lost territory, introducing defensive strategies like [[archery]] in war for the first time in [[Bengal]]'s history and improving Gour's military status.<ref name=potro/> Noted as a disrespectful and intolerant tyrant, Gour Govinda oppressed religious minorities living in his kingdom, in particular the followers of [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]] and certain [[Hindu denominations]]. The kingdom came to an end after the Islamic [[conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303 led by [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and [[Shah Jalal]], leading to the flight of Govinda and the royal family, and the subsequent incorporation of Sylhet with mainland Muslim [[Bengal]] ruled by Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firuz Shah]].<ref name=\"Session1980\">{{cite book|author=North East India History Association.

Some say that the name originated from the kingdom's founder; Gurak, the son of Raja Guhak just as Jaintia was named after Jayantak and [[Laur Kingdom|Laur]] after Ladduk. Other theories are that it was named following the 1170 partition of the kingdom into two. The north was renamed Gour (also transliterated as Gauda in [[Sanskrit]]) as in imitation of the great Hindu [[Gauda Kingdom]] which ruled [[Bengal]] from 590AD to 626AD.<ref name=back/>\n\n==Location and origin==\nThe kingdom consisted of majority of the modern-day [[Sylhet District]]. It included some eastern parts of the modern-day [[Moulvibazar District]] until it split from Gour to become the independent kingdom of Brahmachal. The final king of Gour, [[Gour Govinda]] would reunite Brahmachal to the Gour Kingdom. The [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal kingdom]], to its southwest, was  a vassal state of Gour, and later Brahmachal would be one as well. With Govinda turning Gour into a regional superpower, the [[Laur Kingdom]] may have also been a vassal state as Takerghat (in Laur) was made the naval headquarters during Govinda's rule. In the 850s, much of the kingdom's territory was described to be \"outside the pale of human habitation\" with central and southwestern Sylhet forming a large sea.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brahmanic Settlements in Different Subdivisions of Ancient Bengal|publisher=Indian Studies: Past & Present|year=1967|last=Niyogi|first=Puspa|page=41}}</ref> This explains the naval significance which the Kings of Gour boasted.<ref>{{cite journal|first=K. N.|last=Gupta|title=On Some Castes and Caste-Origins in Sylhet|journal=Indian Historical Quarterly 7|year=1931|pages=725\u201326}}</ref>\n\nThe early rulers of Gour were said to have belonged to an animist clan known as the Pator-Chutia or Patro which later converted to [[Hinduism]] after Raja Guhak's interest in the religion and his initial invitation to Brahmins from Kamarupa to come and migrate to Sylhet. The small tribe remains in existence today and are also known by their endonym, the Laleng, and claim descent from these kings. Their traditions are a mixture of tribal animistic and Hindu beliefs. They have a distinct language to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] and many migrated to [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]] following the 1947 [[Partition of India]] and 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Patra, The|author=Khan, Sadat Ullah}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Xuanzang w.jpg|thumb|[[Xuanzang]] was a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled to Sheelachatal (Sylhet) in the seventh century.]]\nBefore the establishment of the Gour Kingdom, the area was a part of [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintia]] in the greater [[Kamarupa Kingdom]]. When Guhak ascended the Jaintia throne, he married a princess from Kamarupa. Guhak had a deep interest in [[Hinduism]] and migration of [[Brahmins]] from the [[Kamrup region]] to this area took place. On his way back, Guhak brought a stone image known as ''Kangsa-Nisudhana'', an image of [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] murdering [[Kamsa]], as well as Grivakali and Janghakali, and they put it on top of a hill in modern-day where they would worship it. During the British colonial period, this hill was also home to the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow.<ref name=back/>\n\nGuhak had three sons; Jayantak, Gurak and Ladduk, and two daughters; Sheela and Chatala. It is said that his eldest daughter, Sheela, was once bathing in a lake south of the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule) and she was kidnapped. After being rescued by Guhak, Sheela started to become more religious and live a secluded life. Chatala indulged herself in an unlawful relationship with one of the palace servants, leading to her being disowned and dumped in a distant island in the middle of 2000 square mile lake to the south of the kingdom. After Sheela's death at a young age, Guhak gave up his kingdom to also lead a more ascetic life. This port-area around the lake, which was the largest centre in the Jaintia Kingdom for trade, was named Sheela [[haat]] (or Sheela's marketplace) in her honour. Sources such as the Hattanath Tales mention Sheelachatal was named after both daughters for the region.<ref name=fazlur/> This is one of many theories of how [[Sylhet]] got its name.<ref>see [[Names of Sylhet]]</ref> [[Xuanzang]] of [[China]] mentions that he visited Sheelachatal in the 630s in his book, the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]''. He split the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] into three for his three sons. He gave his eldest son, Jayantak, what would become the hilly [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. He gave his second son, Gurak, the southern plains which would be named Gour, and he gave his third son, Luddak, the western plains which would become the [[Laur Kingdom]].<ref name=pak/>\n\nGurak made the capital initially at Borchola, 5 miles northwest of modern-day [[Sylhet]], but moved it to Malini stream bank, 7 miles south of Sylhet. He appointed Marbel as his chief minister. The minister was stationed in a hillock (now known as [[Mona Rai]]'s Tila) near [[Sylhet|the port]] for ease in tax collection and civil duties.<ref name=back>{{cite book|first=Rajmohan|last=Nath|title=The back-ground of Assamese culture|pages=113|url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.34829/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1948|publisher=A. K. Nath|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Mass migration period===\nBeing separated from [[Kamarupa]] by the [[Jaintia Kingdom]], Gour started interacting more with the Hindu lands to its west such as Tripura and Prayagraj. Minister Marbel was ordered to find a wife for Gurak's son, Srihasta. He went south to the [[Twipra Kingdom]] in eastern Bengal where he found a young princess for Srihasta. When Srihasta ascended the throne in 660, he too contributed to the increase of [[Hindu]] influence to the predominantly [[Tantric Buddhist]] and animist-populated land. He installed a stone [[Shivalingam]], which he called Bateshwar Shiva, in modern-day Bondor Bazar which he obtained during a pilgrimage to [[Akshayavat]] in [[Prayagraj]]. It is said he did this to compete with the Buddhist Lokenath statue which a group of merchants installed in modern-day Kazir Bazar. Gour also bordered Bengal to the west which was ruled by the Buddhist [[Pala Empire]]. The Buddhist and later Muslim rule in Bengal led to large numbers of [[Hindus]] to migrate to Gour, which was considered a Hindu stronghold. Srihasta's reign ended in 690 AD and he was succeeded by Kritti Pal. The names of the four kings who succeeded Kritti Pal is unknown until 870 AD, when Bhut Vishnudeva ascends the throne as the 7th king of Gour. He was known to have been [[Muteness|mute]]. He was succeeded by Navagirvan Deva (also known as Ananta Deva Navagirvanta) who is mentioned in the Bhatera copper-plate inscription as Kharavana. The Bhatera copper-plate inscription mentions the rulers of Gour from Navagirvan upto Kesava Deva. Navagirvan is attributed for bringing prosperity to Srihatta. His son, Gokul Kishore Deva was described in the inscription to be so strong that he imposed inactivity to enemy kingdoms. Gokul's son, Narayana Deva had a minister named Nandaka and a son named Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva.<ref name=bhatera1>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/epigrahiaindicav014768mbp/page/n365/|last=Gupta|first=Prof Dr K M|location=[[Sylhet]]|journal=[[Epigraphia Indica]]|title=49.

He became king in 990 AD after the death of his father, Narayan Deva. He is considered to be one of the greatest kings of Gour. In 1027, he constructed a towering stone [[Krishna]] temple on the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule).<ref name=eaton/> A famed patron of [[Hinduism]], he hosted hundreds of [[Brahmins]] and [[Vedic scholar]]s from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and other parts of [[the subcontinent]], employing them upon the services of temples in his kingdom.<ref name=pak/><ref name=fazlur>{{cite book|title=Sile\u1e6der m\u0101\u1e6di, Sile\u1e6der m\u0101nush|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|page=33|year=1991|publisher=MA Sattar}}</ref> They were given thousands of acres of land each in over hundreds of villages across the kingdom.

After invading the kingdom of Kuchunia to his north ruled by Uraj Mardan, he also married Mardan's daughter Chandana and had a son with her named Ishan Deva. After the death of [[Srichandra]] of eastern Bengal's [[Chandra dynasty]], Kesava took advantage and conquered the southern parts of the [[Sylhet region]]; extending the Gour kingdom south of the [[Kushiyara River]].<ref name=pak>{{cite book|title=East Pakistan District Gazetteers: Sylhet|year=1970|publisher=East Pakistan Government Press}}</ref>\n\nKesava's reign ended in 1040, leaving behind three sons; Jadava Kesava, Kangsa Narayan and Ishan Deva. The elder son, Jadava was meant to be king though he was said to have been childless and diseased, and so his brother, Kangsa Narayan became the next king instead. Kangsa established a [[satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|satra]] in the memory of his father, and dug Kamala Lake in memory of his mother, Kamala. Kangsa's rule was very short as he was killed by a wild elephant at a young age. His newly-wed and pregnant wife, Kalavati, a princess from [[Bihar]], became the queen regent with Prince Ishan Deva, General Viradatta and Minister Vanamali Kar managing the kingdom. Kalavati gave birth to a son who was named Pravir Deva. To celebrate Pravir's birth, Ishan installed the [[Madhu-Kaitabha]]ri Temple - which contained an image of [[Vishnu]] - on a hillock now known as Manik Pir's hill.<ref name=fazlur/> The installation ceremony was conducted by a group of [[Brahmins]] and they were rewarded by the administration by receiving excessive land grants in the kingdom. Pravir Deva became the Raja of Gour when he reached a mature age in 1080 AD. He had a son named Bhujavir.\n\n===Partition===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Brahmachal infiltration\n| date       = 1253\n| place      = Brahmachal palace (Baramchal, [[Kulaura]])\n| territory  = [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] re-annexed to Gour\n| result     = Amar Singh replaces Upananda as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = [[Brahmachal Kingdom]]\n----\n{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Twipra Kingdom]] (''defector'')\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n| commander2 = '''Raja Upananda'''{{KIA}}\n* Commander [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] (''defector'')\n* Minister (name unknown)\n* [[Jaidev Rai]] (minister's son)\n----{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]] (''defector'')\n| }}\nIn 1140 AD, after the death of Bhujavir Deva, his son Kshetra Pal ascended the throne. Raja Kshetra Pal also practised [[polygyny]] and had two wives; Ratnavati and Surama. During his reign, an earthquake took place which changed the country's contour and topography. It is said that a new river emerged in the town, which the King named after his second and favourite wife, Rani Surama, as the [[Surma River]]. The King's first son came from Surama and his name was Brahmajit. A few years later, Kshetra's first wife Ratnavati also gave birth to a son, called Dharmadhwaj. However, conspiracies emerged in the country as a number of people were suspicious of Ratnavati accusing her of jealousy and child illegitimacy as Kshetra was an old man by this time. After Kshetra died, his eldest son, Brahmajit stepped to the throne. His stepmother Ratnavati and her associates gave Brahmajit a hard time as she believed that as she was the elder wife, her son should have been the King.\n\nScared for his life, Brahmajit moved his capital to a place known as Brahmachal (now Baramchal, [[Kulaura]]), just north of the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. He then appointed his stepbrother Dharmadhwaj to govern over the old capital, which retained its name as Gour. Conflict did not emerge as both rulers thought that they were in control of the kingdom as a whole, but gradually the two lands split to become two different kingdoms; Gour and [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] in 1170 AD. The two stepsons worked together and hosted a [[Vedic]] [[yajna]] at the Bhatera Homer Tila at Brahmachal which was arranged by Nidhipati Shastri, who was a descendant of Ananda Shastri - a [[Brahmin]] from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] who arrived in Sylhet during the rule of Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva. Another yajna was hosted by Raja Sengkwchak Dharmadhar of the [[Twipra Kingdom]] with Nidhipati as a priest as well who was rewarded with what would become the Ita Kingdom. Dharmadhwaj of Gour died in 1200, and was succeeded by his son, Rajadhwaj who ruled until his death in 1230 in which his son, Gouradhwaj Bhabananda took the throne.\n\n===Civil war===\n[[Raja Govardhan]] rose to power in 1250 following the death of his father, Gouradhwaj. During this period, Upananda was the King of [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]]. The long-lasted conflict between the north and south continued during Govardhan's reign. Govardhan appointed his chief minister, [[Madan Rai]], to somehow find a way to lure Upananda's general, [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]], to use him as a tool to infiltrate Brahmachal, as Govardhan was not fond of Upananda. Govardhan and Rai then made an agreement with Govardhan's general Virabhadra to give his daughter, Chandrakala, in marriage to Singh. The marriage was successful, despite protests, and Singh maintained a good relationship with General Virabhadra and a developing relationship with the Gour royal court. Singh had close ties with the [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]], the border guards for the [[Twipra Kingdom]] south of Brahmachal. He managed to persuade the Kuki chiefs into raiding Raja Upananda's palace in the dead of the night, massacring most of its inmates. With the emergence of a civil war between Brahmachal and Gour, Raja Upananda was subsequently killed. Brahmachal became a part of the Gour kingdom again, and Govardhan appointed [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] as its feudal governor. Babysat by the Upananda's older sister-in-law, Anna Purna, thirteen royal children managed to flee to the jungles where they stumbled across Giridhari, a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] [[sannyasi]], Giridhari took them to [[Kamakhya Temple]] where they were trained into hermitage and would return to Gour a few years later during the tribal invasion.\n\n===Conflict with Tungachal===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Tungachal conflict\n| date       = 1258\n| place      = Banks of Ghungi Jurir Haor, Tungachal\n| territory  = [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal]] secured to Gour administration\n| result     = Shandul replaces Epivishnu as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = Tungachal Kingdom\n----Brahmachal remnant officers\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n* [[Amar Singh (general)|Raja Amar Singh]]{{KIA}}\n| commander2 = '''Raja Epivishnu'''{{KIA}}\n* General Raghu{{POW}}\n* Minister Bhadra Janardan\n| }}\n[[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] which was ruled by Upananda contained the territory of Tungachal. In effect, this meant that the feudal ruler of Tungachal, Epivishnu - who was not given a choice - was effectively under the control of [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Having close ties with Brahmachal and Tripura, Epivishnu was adamant to Govardhan and Singh's amicable compromises. With Epivishnu refusing every pleasant proposal given to be a feudal ruler under Gour, Govardhan and Singh decided it was time that they dethrone Epivishnu and appoint someone else to govern Tungachal. The Gour forces entered Tungachal, and a battle emerged on the banks of the Ghungi Jurir Haor. Raja Epivishnu was murdered and his commander-in-chief General Raghu was kidnapped and taken as a captive back to Gour. Govardhan then appointed his second general, Shandul, to be the feudal ruler of Tungachal.\n\n===Tribal invasion===\nThe Raja of the [[Twipra Kingdom]], Ratan Manikya was informed of Singh's treacherous actions and how he tricked the Kuki chiefs, he decided that he takes actions. He was also told of the murder of Raja Epivishnu, whom he was a friend of. Ratan believed the Gour administration was going too far and decided to also put a stop to Govardhan's craving of invading neighbouring kingdoms. He sent a contingent towards Brahmachal to attack [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Singh's forces were outnumbered, and requested assistance from Govardhan. However, Govardhan was unable to help as Gour was facing an invasion in the north from the [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. Singh was killed by the Tripura forces and the Kuki chiefs saw this as an opportunity for them to annex Brahmachal to the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. [[Jaidev Rai]], son of the minister of Raja Upananda, who was the king of Brahmachal before Amar Singh, was made the feudal ruler under the Tripuris. The [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s then proceeded to Tungachal, in an attempt to dethrone Shandul. Shandul decided to flee to Gour, thus enabling the Tripuris to bloodlessly annex Tungachal to its kingdom as well. The former minister of Tungachal, Bhadra Janardan, was appointed as the feudal ruler of Tungachal under the Twipra Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Jaintia Kingdom]], north of Gour, attempted to invade and annex Gour to its kingdom as they could see that Govardhan was focused on the insurgencies in the southern areas of his kingdom and on securing Brahmachal and Tungachal. The various indigenous tribes and neighbouring kingdoms including the [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s, [[Kuki people|Kuki]]s, [[Kachari people|Kachari]]s and [[Naga people|Naga]]s joined forces with the [[Pnar people|Pnar]] and [[Khasi people|Khasi]] of the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in attacking Northern Sylhet.

They gained some authority in the kingdom, being favoured by Govinda over the native Hindus for their religious orthodoxy. The elitist Brahmins cooperatively led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over during the reign of Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s (''untouchables'') of the lowest social status. The Brahmins from [[Central India]] brought by Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva, were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class \"Govinda Brahmins\" as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\nA small number of [[Muslims|Muslim families]] from neighbouring Bengal also settled in Gour, possibly following [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]]'s 1254 [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Invasion]]. One day, [[Ghazi Burhanuddin]] - who lived with his family in Tultikar -  sacrificed a cow for the [[aqiqah]] of his newborn son, Gulzar Alam. [[Gour Govinda]], in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn killed as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off. Shortly after this incident, Qadi Nuruddin of Taraf celebrated his son's marriage ceremony by slaughtering a cow for them to eat. The Qadi was executed by the feudal ruler Achak Narayan. After both men being punished, Burhanuddin and Nuruddin's brother, Halimuddin, travelled to lower Bengal where they addressed their issue with Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]]. This marked the start of the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303, with the Sultan appointing his nephew, [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], to lead an army against the Raja. A number of battles took place, with Govinda managing to defeat the Muslims of Bengal. However, in the final battle, Govinda fled with his family following the arrival of the warrior-saint [[Shah Jalal]] and his companions, numbering over three hundred. [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]] was appointed the first Wazir of Sylhet, and Tungachal would subsequently be captured off Achak Narayan in the following year by [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and his 12 [[lascar]]s.\nghaturam\n\n==List of rulers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Titular Name\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Reign\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Officers\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Notes\n|-\n| Gurak (\u0997\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u0995)\n| 630-660\n| Marbel (chief minister)\n| Son of Raja Guhak of greater Jaintia who split his kingdom into three; giving a third to Gurak.\n|-\n| Srihasta (\u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0\u09b9\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4)\n| 660-690\n| \n| 2nd Raja, Son of Raja Gurak; married a [[Tripuri people|Tripuri princess]]\n|-\n| Kritti Pal (\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf\u09aa\u09be\u09b2)\n| 690-720\n|\n| 3rd Raja, Son of Srihasta\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"| Unknown rulers (720-870)\n|-\n| Bhut Vishnudeva (\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b7\u09cd\u09a3\u09c1\u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 870-900\n|\n| 7th Raja\n|-\n| Navagirvan Kharavana Dev (\u09a8\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09b0\u09ac\u09be\u09a3 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 900-930\n|\n| 8th Raja, son of Bhut\n|-\n| Gokul Kishore (\u0997\u09cb\u0995\u09c1\u09b2 \u0995\u09bf\u09b6\u09cb\u09b0)\n| 930-960\n|\n| 9th Raja, son of Navagirvan\n|-\n| Narayan Deva (\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u09af\u09bc\u09a3 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 960-990\n|\n| 10th Raja, son of Gokul\n|-\n| Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva (\u0997\u09cb\u09ac\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6 \u09b0\u09a3 \u0995\u09c7\u09b6\u09ac \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 990-1040\n| Kamala and Chandana (queens), Jadava, Kangsa and Ishan (princes)\n| 11th Raja, son of Narayan\n|-\n| Kangsa Narayan (\u0995\u0982\u09b8 \u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u09af\u09bc\u09a3)\n| 1040-1060\n| Kalavati (queen), \n| 12th Raja, son of Govinda and Kamala\n|-\n| Ishan Deva (\u0988\u09b6\u09be\u09a8 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 1060-1080\n| Vanamali Kar (chief minister), Viradatta (commander), Kalavati (queen-regent)\n| 13th ruler (acting), son of Govinda and Chandana\n|-\n| Pravir Deva (\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09ac\u09c0\u09b0 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac)\n| 1080-1100 \n| Vanamali Kar (chief minister), Viradatta (commander), Kalavati (queen-mother)\n| 14th Raja, son of Kangsa Narayan\n|-\n| Bhujavir (\u09ad\u09c1\u099c\u09ac\u09c0\u09b0 or \u09ad\u09c2\u099c\u09ac\u09c0\u09b0)\n| 1100-1140\n| Kshetra Pal (prince)\n| 15th Raja, son of Pravir\n|-\n| Kshetra Pal (\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09c7\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09aa\u09be\u09b2)\n| 1140-1170\n| Ratnavati and Surama (queens), Dharmadhwaj and Rajadhwaj (princes)\n| 16th Raja, son of Bhujavir\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"| Partition of Gour\n|-\n| Dharmadhwaj (\u09a7\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c)\n| 1170-1200\n| Ruled Gour, alongside Brahmajit who moved to Brahmachal\n| 17th Raja, son of Kshetra and Ratnavati\n|-\n| Rajadhwaj (\u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c)\n| 1200-1230\n| \n| 18th Raja, son of Dharmadhwaj\n|-\n| Gouradhwaj Bhabananda (\u0997\u09cc\u09a1\u09bc\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c \u09ad\u09ac\u09be\u09a8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6)\n| 1230-1250\n|\n| 19th Raja, son of Rajadhwaj\n|-\n| [[Govardhan of Gour|Gangadhwaj Govardhan]] (\u0997\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09ac\u099c \u0997\u09cb\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a7\u09a8)\n| 1250-1260\n| [[Madan Rai]] (chief minister), Apurna (queen), Virabhadra (commander-in-chief), Shandul (Tungachal governor), [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]] (heir-apparent), [[Amar Singh (general)|Raja Amar Singh]] (Brahmachal governor)\n| 20th Raja, son of Gouradhwaj Bhabananda\n|-\n| [[Gour Govinda]] (\u0997\u09cc\u09a1\u09bc \u0997\u09cb\u09ac\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6)\n| 1260-1303\n| [[Mona Rai]] (chief minister), Chakrapani Dutta (commander), Hiravati (queen), Apurna (queen-mother), Achak Narayan (Tungachal governor), [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]] and Nirvana (princes), Shantipriya (princess)\n| 21st Raja, defended Gour during Jaintia invasion, descendant of Brahmajit\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"| Islamic [[Conquest of Gour]], end of Gour Kingdom\n|}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the 1880s, two copper-plate inscriptions were discovered in the Itertilla mound in the village of Bhatera.

It is a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The three other internal sequences include the [[procreation sonnets]] (1\u201317), the [[The Sonnets#The Rival Poet|Rival Poet]] sequence (78\u201386) and the [[The Sonnets#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] sequence (127\u2013154).  While the exact date of composition of Sonnet 101 is unknown, scholars generally agree that the group of Sonnets 61\u2013103 was written mainly in the first half of the 1590s and was not revised before being published with the complete sequence of sonnets in the [[1609 Quarto]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=William|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets : An Original-Spelling Text|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford;New York|isbn=978-0-19-964207-6|pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe Muse is chided for her absence and neglect of praise for the youth. The poet-speaker goes further, imagining the Muse responding that truth and beauty need no additions or explanations. The Muse is implored by the poet to praise the youth. The poet will teach her how to immortalize the youth's beauty.\n\n==Structure==\n\nSonnet 101 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ''[[Rhyme scheme|ABAB CDCD EFEF GG]]'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 11th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /    \u00d7   /   \u00d7   /   \u00d7  /  \u00d7   / \nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb (101.11)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n\nThe 7th line has a common metrical variation, an initial reversal:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n /   \u00d7  \u00d7  /  \u00d7    /   \u00d7     /    \u00d7  / \nBeauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay; (101.7)\n</pre>\n\nInitial reversals are potentially present in lines 6 and 12, and a mid-line reversal (\"what shall\") is potentially present in line 1. The parallelism of \"seem\" and \"shows\" in the final line suggest a rightward movement of the fourth ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, <code>\u00d7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;/&nbsp;/</code>, sometimes referred to as a ''minor ionic''):\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /    \u00d7   /     \u00d7    /     \u00d7   \u00d7   /    / \nTo make him seem, long hence, as he shows now. (101.14)\n</pre>\n\nWhile Petrarchan sonnets by tradition have a [[volta (literature)|volta]] at the end of line eight, in Shakespeare's sonnets this can occur as late as line 12 and sometimes not \nat all.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=96|edition=Revised}}</ref>\nIn Sonnet 101, a volta seems to occur at the end of line eight, \nas the poet-speaker, in a role-reversal with the Muse, begins to actively lead the Muse towards the couplet and there provides the Muse with a solution to the problem of \"what to say and how to say it\" thus ensuring that memory of youth will endure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=97|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n== Context ==\n\n=== Within the sonnet sequence ===\n\nIn addition to Sonnet 100, Sonnet 101 is recognized as one of the only two sonnets in the complete sequence which directly invokes the Muse.  These two sonnets in turn are part of the group of four sonnets, 100\u2013103, wherein the poet-speaker deflects blame for his silence from himself onto the Muse, making excuses for having not written or if writing, not writing adequately.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Samuel|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets Reconsidered|edition=[New ed.]|location=London|publisher=J.

By Sonnet 101, however, the poet has taken a very different tone with the Muse, and no longer simply begs or implores for inspiration, but rather asks \"Oh truant Muse what shall be thy amends / for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\" (Sonnet 101,1-2). The poet has gone from speaking as passively inspired to demanding amends from the Muse for its neglect of he and his Fair Youth. The poet then implicates the Muse in his own plight, by declaring, \"Both truth and beauty on my love depends; / so dost thou too, and therein dignified\" (101, 3-4), meaning that both the poet and the Muse are given purpose by their function in praising truth and beauty.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =\n | first =\n| title =Remarks on the Sonnets of Shakespeare\n | publisher =James Miller\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition =\n | date =1867\n | location =New York\n | pages =\n | url =https://archive.org/details/cu31924013143866\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Quatrain 2 ===\nAs mentioned above, rather than asking for inspiration, the poet demands explanation, though now he presumes his [[Muse|Muse's]] excuse for the neglect, which the poet takes to be that truth of beauty is self-evident, and needs no further embellishment. It is in the second and third line of this quatrain, or the sixth and seventh lines in the sonnet, where the rhythmic structure of Sonnet 101 becomes noteworthy. Whereas the rest of Sonnet 101 follows conventional structural patterns, it is in line 6 and 7, \"Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed; / Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay,\" that the rhythm deviates from the established norm, which is discussed in depth earlier in this article. Though there is no definitive explanation for this alteration, its inconsistency warrants speculation. If we assume that the difference in pattern is not an oversight on the part of Shakespeare, then it is conceivable that this creative idiosyncrasy was made for aesthetic or symbolic reasons. It is then pertinent to question why these particular lines are given this unique structural treatment. Putting aside aesthetic interpretation, it could be conceived that Shakespeare intentionally chose these two lines with which to assert freedom from the regular metrics of iambic pentameter, to show that truth and beauty should be singled out. Given this interpretation of the second and third lines of the quatrain, the fourth line, \"But best is best, if never intermixed?\" can even be read as the poet-speaker's assessment that his Muse does not see fit to embellish truth and beauty through poetic inspiration.\n\n=== Quatrain 3 ===\nThe poet rejects this neglect of praise that he has attributed to his Muse's will, and rationalizes that it is this very praise which will immortalize the Fair Youth, \"to make him much outlive a gilded tomb / and to be praised of ages yet to be\" (Sonnet 101, 11-12). The contextual use of the phrase \"gilded tomb\" potentially refers to two different concepts, one being the meaningless decadence of expensive burial chambers, and the other being a tome as in a large volume of literature. As T. Walker Herbert notes, \"tomb and tome could be spelled tombe in the seventeenth century.\" \"Granted that the external evidence is permissive rather than conclusive, let it be supposed to Shakespeare's ear that tome and tomb were sounded enough alike for purposes of a pun.\" (Herbert, 236, 239) A third concept is suggested by [[William Empson]] (p.&nbsp;138) interpreting \"tombe\" so that \"tomb is formal praise as would be written on a tombstone, whereas real merits of a man are closely connected with his faults.\" In other words, the poet-speaker is telling the muse he has the power to save his reputation when his social enemies might be writing the elegy or epitaph for his popularity, or possibly that the inner truth which is the source of his outward beauty will outlive the end of that youthful idea of beauty, or even that by the Muse singing his praise, the youth might be encouraged to sustain his lineage, even though he himself may grow old and pass on.  Empson suggests that multiple ambiguous readings like this \"must all combine to give the line its beauty and there is a sort of ambiguity in not knowing which of them to hold most clearly in mind.  Clearly this is involved in all such richness and heightening of effect, and the machinations of ambiguity are among the very roots of poetry.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Herbert\n | first =T.

This is a significant change in attitude from the poet's previous prayers for inspiration in Sonnet 100, and even the poet's indignation at the beginning of Sonnet 101.  The poet has gone from being passively inspired to a self-appointed leader of his own inspiration, which is a show of confidence that the poet does not necessarily maintain throughout the full body of sonnets.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Shakespeare sonnets bibliography}}\n\n{{Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare's sonnets}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonnet 101}}\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare]]\n", "text_old": "{{Sonnet|101|Sonnet 101 1609.jpg|The first line of Sonnet 101 in the 1609 Quarto|\nO truant Muse, what shall be thy amends\nFor thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\nBoth truth and beauty on my love depends;\nSo dost thou too, and therein dignified.\nMake answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say,\n\u201cTruth needs no colour, with his colour fix\u2019d;\nBeauty no pencil, beauty\u2019s truth to lay;\nBut best is best, if never intermix\u2019d\u201d?\nBecause he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\nExcuse not silence so, for\u2019t lies in thee\nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb\nAnd to be praised of ages yet to be.\n:Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how\n:To make him seem long hence as he shows now.\n|source=<ref>{{cite book |title=The Works of Shakespeare: Sonnets |editor-first=C[harles] Knox |editor-last=Pooler |series=The Arden Shakespeare [1st series] |location=London |publisher=Methuen & Company |date=1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/sonnetseditedbyc00shakuoft |oclc=4770201}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Sonnet 101''' is one of [[The Sonnets|154 sonnets]] written by the English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]]. It is a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The three other internal sequences include the [[procreation sonnets]] (1\u201317), the [[The Sonnets#The Rival Poet|Rival Poet]] sequence (78\u201386) and the [[The Sonnets#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] sequence (127\u2013154).  While the exact date of composition of Sonnet 101 is unknown, scholars generally agree that the group of Sonnets 61\u2013103 was written mainly in the first half of the 1590s and was not revised before being published with the complete sequence of sonnets in the [[1609 Quarto]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=William|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets : An Original-Spelling Text|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford;New York|isbn=978-0-19-964207-6|pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe Muse is chided for her absence and neglect of praise for the youth. The poet-speaker goes further, imagining the Muse responding that truth and beauty need no additions or explanations. The Muse is implored by the poet to praise the youth. The poet will teach her how to immortalize the youth's beauty.\n\n==Structure==\n\nSonnet 101 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ''[[Rhyme scheme|ABAB CDCD EFEF GG]]'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 11th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /    \u00d7   /   \u00d7   /   \u00d7  /  \u00d7   / \nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb (101.11)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''.\n\nThe 7th line has a common metrical variation, an initial reversal:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n /   \u00d7  \u00d7  /  \u00d7    /   \u00d7     /    \u00d7  / \nBeauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay; (101.7)\n</pre>\n\nInitial reversals are potentially present in lines 6 and 12, and a mid-line reversal (\"what shall\") is potentially present in line 1. The parallelism of \"seem\" and \"shows\" in the final line suggest a rightward movement of the fourth ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, <code>\u00d7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;/&nbsp;/</code>, sometimes referred to as a ''minor ionic''):\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7  /    \u00d7   /     \u00d7    /     \u00d7   \u00d7   /    / \nTo make him seem, long hence, as he shows now. (101.14)\n</pre>\n\nWhile Petrarchan sonnets by tradition have a [[volta (literature)|volta]] at the end of line eight, in Shakespeare's sonnets this can occur as late as line 12 and sometimes not \nat all.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=96|edition=Revised}}</ref>\nIn Sonnet 101, a volta seems to occur at the end of line eight, \nas the poet-speaker, in a role-reversal with the Muse, begins to actively lead the Muse towards the couplet and there provides the Muse with a solution to the problem of \"what to say and how to say it\" thus ensuring that memory of youth will endure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duncan-Jones|first1=Katherine|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|date=2010|publisher=Arden Shakespeare|location=London|isbn=1-4080-1797-0|page=97|edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n== Context ==\n\n=== Within the sonnet sequence ===\n\nIn addition to Sonnet 100, Sonnet 101 is recognized as one of the only two sonnets in the complete sequence which directly invokes the Muse.  These two sonnets in turn are part of the group of four sonnets, 100\u2013103, wherein the poet-speaker deflects blame for his silence from himself onto the Muse, making excuses for having not written or if writing, not writing adequately.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Samuel|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets Reconsidered|edition=[New ed.]|location=London|publisher=J.

Walker Herbert notes, \"tomb and tome could be spelled tombe in the seventeenth century.\" \"Granted that the external evidence is permissive rather than conclusive, let it be supposed to Shakespeare's ear that tome and tomb were sounded enough alike for purposes of a pun.\" (Herbert, 236, 239) A third concept is suggested by [[William Empson]] (p.&nbsp;138) interpreting \"tombe\" so that \"tomb is formal praise as would be written on a tombstone, whereas real merits of a man are closely connected with his faults.\" In other words, the poet-speaker is telling the muse he has the power to save his reputation when his social enemies might be writing the elegy or epitaph for his popularity, or possibly that the inner truth which is the source of his outward beauty will outlive the end of that youthful idea of beauty, or even that by the Muse singing his praise, the youth might be encouraged to sustain his lineage, even though he himself may grow old and pass on.  Empson suggests that multiple ambiguous readings like this \"must all combine to give the line its beauty and there is a sort of ambiguity in not knowing which of them to hold most clearly in mind.  Clearly this is involved in all such richness and heightening of effect, and the machinations of ambiguity are among the very roots of poetry.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Herbert\n | first =T.

He joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1981, and eventually succeeded [[William Hague]] as Conservative Leader in 2001; he won the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] partly owing to the support of [[Margaret Thatcher]] for his [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] beliefs.

The policy has been credited with reversing Norway's trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to \u00a3100&nbsp;billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to \"work through what is going to happen with their children\", which has \"a very big effect on their thinking\". \"Many of them think again about what they are going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently,\" he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |title=IDS backs shock courses to stop couples splitting up |date=28 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012357/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |archive-date=6 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuncan Smith said in February 2011 that it was \"absurd and damaging\" for ministers not to extol the benefits of marriage for fear of stigmatising those who choose not to marry. Duncan Smith said: \"We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children. There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage.\" He added that \"The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to see is the human cost \u2013 the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |title=Couples should be encouraged to marry, says Iain Duncan Smith |date=8 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211084819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, Duncan Smith signalled his support for [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] on the basis that it would promote stability in relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|title=Iain Duncan Smith defies Catholic Church to back marriage for gay couples|work=PinkNews|date=28 April 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429151542/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|archive-date=29 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Views on immigration===\nDuncan Smith has said that tighter immigration controls are vital if Britain is to avoid \"losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness\". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with \"something to offer\" should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. According to ''The Daily Telegraph'''s analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron \"that a 'slack' attitude to immigration will result in the Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants\". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as \"an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain\". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed \"a level playing field\". \"If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people,\" he said.<ref>Andrew Porter, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html Migrants 'take the jobs from young Britons'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827041733/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html |date=27 August 2019 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111104191200/http://www.fundacionfaes.org/record_file/filename/3098/2011_07_01_IAIN_DUNCAN_SMITH.pdf Address by Iain Duncan Smith at the opening session of the FAES campus], fundacionfaes.org; accessed 9 May 2015.</ref>\n\n===Views on social credit===\nDuncan Smith has called for cuts to [[Universal Credit]] to be reversed.

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician. The [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] from 2010 to 2016, he was previously the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2001 to 2003. He was first elected to [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]] \u2013 which he represented until the constituency's abolition in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] \u2013 and he has since represented its successor constituency of [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]].\n\nDuncan Smith was born in [[Edinburgh]] and served in the [[Scots Guards]] from 1975 to 1981, seeing tours in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Rhodesia]]. He joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1981, and eventually succeeded [[William Hague]] as Conservative Leader in 2001; he won the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] partly owing to the support of [[Margaret Thatcher]] for his [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] beliefs. Duncan Smith was the first [[Catholic church|Catholic]] to serve as a Conservative Leader, and the first Conservative leader to be born in Scotland since [[Arthur Balfour]]. In 2010, ''[[The Tablet]]'' named him one of Britain's most influential Catholics.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tablet's Top 100 |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313083725/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/pdf/4283 |archive-date=13 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMany Conservative MPs came to consider him incapable of winning an election when he was Conservative Party Leader. In 2003, Conservative MPs passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership; he immediately resigned, and was succeeded by [[Michael Howard]]. Returning to the backbenches, he founded the [[centre-right]] [[Centre for Social Justice]], a [[think tank]] independent of the Conservative Party, and became a published novelist. On 12 May 2010, the new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]], appointed Duncan Smith to serve in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]]. He resigned from the Cabinet on 18 March 2016, in opposition to Chancellor [[George Osborne]]'s proposed cuts to disability benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687|title=Iain Duncan Smith quits over planned disability benefit changes|work=BBC News|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418234840/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848687|archive-date=18 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Duncan Smith served as chairman for [[Boris Johnson|Boris Johnson's]] leadership campaign, resulting in an emphatic win, with over 50% of MPs and 66% of the Conservative membership voting for Johnson to become the next Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister.\n\n==Early life==\nDuncan Smith was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of [[W. G. G. Duncan Smith|Wilfrid George Gerald \"W. G. G.\" Duncan Smith]], a decorated [[Royal Air Force]] [[flying ace]] of the Second World War, and Pamela Summers, a ballerina. His parents married in 1946.

At the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he stood in the London constituency of [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]], a safe Conservative seat, following the retirement of Conservative MP [[Norman Tebbit]]. He became a member of the House of Commons with a majority of nearly 15,000.\n\nA committed [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]], Duncan Smith became a constant thorn in the side of Prime Minister [[John Major]]'s government of 1992 to 1997, opposing Major's pro-European agenda at the time (something that would often be raised during his own subsequent leadership when he called for the party to unite behind him).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nDuncan Smith remained on the [[backbencher|backbenches]] until 1997, when the new Conservative leader [[William Hague]] brought him into the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as Shadow Social Security Secretary. At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], boundary changes saw his constituency renamed [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]] and his majority of 14,938 was reduced to 5,714. Duncan Smith realised the dangers that he and neighbouring Conservative MPs faced, so redoubled his efforts: \"We spent the final week of the campaign working my seat as if it was a marginal.

In September 2001, Duncan Smith was the successful candidate in the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative Party leadership election]]. Although he was initially viewed as an outsider,  his campaign was bolstered when [[Margaret Thatcher]] publicly gave her support for him. His victory in the contest was helped by the fact that his opponent in the final vote of party members was [[Kenneth Clarke]], whose strong support for the [[European Union]] was at odds with the views of much of the party.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2001|accessdate=22 October 2010|title=Duncan Smith elected Tory leader|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1542554.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008182326/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1542554.stm|archive-date=8 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDue to the [[September 11 attacks]], the announcement of Duncan Smith gaining the Conservative leadership was delayed until 13 September 2001. In November 2001, he was one of the first politicians to call for an invasion of [[Iraq]] and held talks in Washington, DC, with senior US officials, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]], [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]].<ref>Rupert Cornwell, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14433602 \"Campaign Against Terrorism: Duncan Smith calls for pressure on Iraq\"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 30 November 2001.</ref>\n\nIn the [[2002 United Kingdom local elections|2002]] and [[2003 United Kingdom local elections|2003 local elections]], the only elections in which Duncan Smith led the party, the Conservatives gained 238 and 568 extra seats on local councils, respectively, primarily in England.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Problems as leader===\n\nThe 2002 Conservative Party conference saw an attempt to turn Duncan Smith's lack of charisma into a positive attribute, with his much-quoted line, \"do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man\". During PMQs, Labour [[backbenchers]] would raise their fingers to their lips and say \"shush\" when he was speaking. The following year, Duncan Smith's conference speech appeared to have abandoned this technique in favour of an aggressive hard-man approach which received several ovations from party members in the hall. \"The quiet man is here to stay, and he's turning up the volume\", Duncan Smith said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3175680.stm |title=Tory leader: Back me or get out |work=BBC News |date=9 October 2003 |accessdate=15 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324220100/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3175680.stm |archive-date=24 March 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDuncan Smith said in December 2002 that he intended to be party leader for a \"very long time to come\".

Duncan Smith said: \"We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children. There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage.\" He added that \"The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to see is the human cost \u2013 the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |title=Couples should be encouraged to marry, says Iain Duncan Smith |date=8 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211084819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, Duncan Smith signalled his support for [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] on the basis that it would promote stability in relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|title=Iain Duncan Smith defies Catholic Church to back marriage for gay couples|work=PinkNews|date=28 April 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429151542/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|archive-date=29 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Views on immigration===\nDuncan Smith has said that tighter immigration controls are vital if Britain is to avoid \"losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness\". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with \"something to offer\" should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. According to ''The Daily Telegraph'''s analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron \"that a 'slack' attitude to immigration will result in the Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants\". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as \"an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain\". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed \"a level playing field\". \"If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people,\" he said.<ref>Andrew Porter, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html Migrants 'take the jobs from young Britons'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827041733/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html |date=27 August 2019 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111104191200/http://www.fundacionfaes.org/record_file/filename/3098/2011_07_01_IAIN_DUNCAN_SMITH.pdf Address by Iain Duncan Smith at the opening session of the FAES campus], fundacionfaes.org; accessed 9 May 2015.</ref>\n\n===Views on social credit===\nDuncan Smith has called for cuts to [[Universal Credit]] to be reversed.
