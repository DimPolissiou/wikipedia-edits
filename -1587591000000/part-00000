It is near the nation's geographic centre. The city has been Rwanda's economic, cultural, and transport hub since it became the capital following independence in 1962. The city hosts the main residence and offices of the [[President of Rwanda]] and government ministries. The city is within the [[Provinces of Rwanda|province]] of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006, as part of local government reorganisation in the country. Kigali's city limits cover the whole province; it is consolidated.

1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda in 1908.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=46}}{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=168}} The first businesses were established in Kigali that year by Greek and Indian

sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=127}} In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside [[Gisenyi]].{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=135}} The difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, and a crippling famine, led the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=130}} Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=142}}{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=275}} This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Des

officials and expansion of control.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=210}} Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in [[Ruanda-Urundi]]'s capital [[Usumbura]], now known as Bujumbura in Burundi.{{sfn|Infor Congo|1958}} Usumbura's population exceeded 50,000 during the 1950s, and was the colony's only European-style

Butare was initially the leading contender to be the capital of the new independent nation, but Kigali was chosen because of its more central location.

On 8 April, Rwandan government forces attacked the RPF base in the parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops successfully fought back.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|pp=264\u2013265}} The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with its isolated troops in Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=269}} The RPF advanced steadily, capturing large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=288}} but avoiding an attack on the city itself, because the city was too heavily defended.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=158}} They instead conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle Kigali and cut off supply routes,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=299}} as well as capturing the rest of the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=268}} By mid-June, the RPF encirclement was complete, and they began fighting for the city itself.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=459}} a date now commemorated as the [[Liberation Day]] [[Public holidays in Rwanda|national holiday]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Official holidays |url=http://www.gov.rw/Official-holidays |accessdate=12 November 2013 |publisher=[[Government of Rwanda|gov.rw]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911035627/http://www.gov.rw/Official-holidays |archivedate=11 September 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough damaged, the city's structure has recovered.\n\n==Geography==\n<!--[[File:Kigali SPOT 1095.jpg|thumb|right|Kigali seen from Spot Satellite]]-->\n[[File:KigaliSuburbs.png|thumb|300px|Map showing major suburbs of Kigali]]\nKigali is located in the centre of Rwanda, at {{Coord|1|57|S|30|4|E|type:city_region:BD|display=inline}}.{{sfn|CIA|2007|p=479}} The city is coterminous with the province of Kigali, one of the five [[provinces of Rwanda]] introduced in 2006 as part of a restructuring of local government in the country.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} The city has boundaries with the [[Northern Province, Rwanda|Northern]], [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern]] and [[Southern Province, Rwanda|Southern]] provinces.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} The city is divided into three administrative [[Districts of Rwanda|districts]]\u2014[[Nyarugenge District|Nyarugenge]], which lies in the south west, [[Kicukiro District|Kicukiro]] in the south east, and [[Gasabo District|Gasabo]], which occupies the northern half of the city's territory.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=11}} Kigali lies in a region of rolling hills,{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}} with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes.{{sfn|REMA|2013|pp=7\u20138}} Kigali lies between the two mountains of [[Mount Kigali]] and [[Mount Jali]],{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} both of which have altitudes over {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},{{sfn|ITMB Publishing|2007}} while the lowest areas of the city have an altitude of {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=7}} Geologically, the city lies in a [[granitic]] and [[metasedimentary]] region, with [[lateritic]] soils on the hills and [[alluvial]] soils in the valleys.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=5}}\n\nThe [[Nyabarongo River]], part of the upper headwaters of the [[Nile River|Nile]],{{sfn|BBC News (II)|2006}} forms the western and southern borders of the administrative city of Kigali,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=4}} although this river lies somewhat outside the built-up urban area.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=6}} The largest river running through the city is the [[Nyabugogo River]], which flows south from [[Lake Muhazi]] before flowing west between Mount Kigali and Mount Jali, and draining into the Nyabarongo.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=8}} The Nyabugogo is fed by various smaller streams throughout the city, and its [[drainage basin]] contains most of Kigali's territory,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=8}} other than areas in the south which outflow directly to the Nyabarongo.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=9}} The rivers are flanked by [[wetland]]s, which act as a water store and flood protection for the city, although these are under threat from agriculture and development.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=9}}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n[[File: Suburban Sprawl in Kigali.jpg|thumb|left| Boulevard in Kigali]]\n\nThe [[central business district]] (CBD) (known in Kinyarwanda as ''mu mujyi'') of Kigali lies on [[Nyarugenge Hill]], and was the site of the original city founded by Richard Kandt in 1907.{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} The house that Kandt lived in is now the [[Kandt House Museum of Natural History]].{{sfn|Mbanda|2014}} Geographically, the CBD lies towards the western edge of the built-up area,{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} as the terrain to the east was more suitable for development of the expanding city than the high slopes of Mount Kigali to the west. Several of Rwanda's highest buildings, including the 20-storey [[Kigali City Tower]], are located in the CBD, as are the headquarters of the country's largest banks and businesses.{{sfn|The EastAfrican|2017}} Other buildings in the CBD include the upmarket [[Kigali Serena Hotel|Serena]], [[Kigali Marriott Hotel|Marriott]] and [[H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines|Mille Collines]] hotels,{{sfn|Mwai|2017}} the [[University Teaching Hospital of Kigali]],{{sfn|Google Maps (I)}} the national university's [[College of Science and Technology (Rwanda)|College of Science and Technology]],{{sfn|Google Maps (II)}} and government buildings such as the [[National Bank of Rwanda]]{{sfn|Google Maps (III)}} and the [[Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (Rwanda)|Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning]].{{sfn|Google Maps (IV)}}\n\nTo the south west of the CBD, and also on the Nyarugenge Hill, is the suburb of [[Nyamirambo]].{{sfn|The Week|2017}} This was the second part of the city to be settled, being built in the 1920s by the Belgian colonial government as a home for civil servants and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders.{{sfn|Tabaro|2014}} This latter group were mostly members of the [[Islam]]ic faith, which led to Nyamirambo being known as the \"Muslim Quarter\".{{sfn|Tabaro|2014}} Nyamirambo's [[Green Mosque (Kigali)|Green Mosque]] (''Masjid al-Fatah'') is the oldest mosque in Kigali, dating back to the 1930s.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2015}} Travel publisher [[Rough Guides]] has described Nyamirambo as \"Kigali's coolest neighbourhood\", citing its multi-cultural status and an active nightlife, which is not found in much of the rest of the city.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2015}} North of Nyamirambo, and west of the CBD is [[Nyabugogo]].

Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]]. It offers online booking and payment, three seat classes and in some busses personal TVs and 240 V/USB sockets.\n* Jaguar Executive Coaches, which connects Kigali to [[Kampala]], the [[Uganda]]n capital, via [[Gatuna]] or via [[Kayonza]] and [[Kagitumba]].\n* Yahoo Car Express \u2013 A minibus service running between Kigali and [[Bujumbura]] in [[Burundi]].\n* Kampala Coach Ltd, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi in Kenya (24 hours), Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (36 hours) and Mombasa in Kenya (32 hours).\n\nKigali is the hub of the Rwanda transport network, with 15 minutes express bus routes to all major towns in the country. There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration. The city's population of about 1.2 million is expected to triple by that time.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices | title=Kigali's future or costly fantasy?

Gisaka.{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=158}} The formation in the 17th century of a new Rwandan dynasty by mwami [[Ruganzu Ndoli|Ruganzu Ndori]], followed by eastward

1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda in 1908.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=46}}{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=168}} The first businesses were established in Kigali that year by Greek and Indian

sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=127}} In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside [[Gisenyi]].{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=135}} The difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, and a crippling famine, led the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=130}} Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=142}}{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=275}} This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Des

officials and expansion of control.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=210}} Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in [[Ruanda-Urundi]]'s capital [[Usumbura]], now known as Bujumbura in Burundi.{{sfn|Infor Congo|1958}} Usumbura's population exceeded 50,000 during the 1950s, and was the colony's only European-style

Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 2481</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.\n\n==Sports==\nThe city is a stronghold for basketball as traditionally, roughly half of the teams of [[Rwanda's National Basketball League]] are based there, including 2016 Champion [[Patriots BBC]], record holding Champion [[Espoir BBC]] and others, including APR  basketball club, IPRC-Kigali and Cercle Sportif de Kigali (CSK).<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201603250258.html Rwanda: Basketball League - Espoir Wary of IPRC-Kigali] Bishumba, Richard, All Africa. 25 March 2016, retrieved 16 October 2016.</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Kigali City Transport inside the City.jpg|thumb|right|Kigali Transport]]\n[[File:TaxiBusesKigali.jpg|thumb|A row of Taxi minibuses waiting to depart in Kigali, Rwanda]]\nThe city has an [[international airport]], [[Kigali International Airport]].<ref>Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Kigali Kigali], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019</ref>\nThe airport is somewhat limited by its location on the top of a hill, and a brand new one is currently being built in the [[Nyamata]] area, some {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Kigali.\n\nThere are several daily coach services which depart from Kigali to destinations in East Africa. Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]]. It offers online booking and payment, three seat classes and in some busses personal TVs and 240 V/USB sockets.\n* Jaguar Executive Coaches, which connects Kigali to [[Kampala]], the [[Uganda]]n capital, via [[Gatuna]] or via [[Kayonza]] and [[Kagitumba]].\n* Yahoo Car Express \u2013 A minibus service running between Kigali and [[Bujumbura]] in [[Burundi]].\n* Kampala Coach Ltd, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi in Kenya (24 hours), Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (36 hours) and Mombasa in Kenya (32 hours).\n\nKigali is the hub of the Rwanda transport network, with 15 minutes express bus routes to all major towns in the country. There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration. The city's population of about 1.2 million is expected to triple by that time.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices | title=Kigali's future or costly fantasy?

(AKA '''Foley''' / '''Cobra''' / '''The Chris''' / '''Chris Himself''') (born 1974) is an [[United States|American]] [[radio host]]. He has hosted radio shows in several cities since 1998. KiddChris currently host the KiddChris show on  [[WEBN]]  in Cincinnati OH.\n\nThe radio show originated in his home town of [[Syracuse, New York]]. His controversial radio show made way to [[Wichita, Kansas]] ( [[KICT-FM|KICT]]  T-95FM,  [[KDGS]]  Power 93.9FM,  [[KHLT-FM|KANR]] FLY 92.7FM) which raised the ire of local church groups. Many religious organizations attempted to band together and remove KiddChris from the airwaves, but he remained on the air.\n\nChris then moved on to [[Sacramento, California]] where he hosted a morning show on a hip-hop station  [[KSFM]]. After several months, he moved into an evening show on sister FM talk station  [[KYRV|KXOA]] . KiddChris's four-hour talk show was one of the highest-rated radio shows on the Pacific coast. While in Sacramento, Chris gained national attention by sending a series of prank phone calls made to [[O.J. Simpson]] to the popular [[Opie and Anthony]] and [[Howard Stern]] nationally syndicated shows and Thomas Kitajima eventually joined the show in Sacramento.\n\nIn the fall of 2002, KiddChris took a hiatus from radio and retired to upstate New York. There, he rejuvenated himself and prepared for his return, which occurred on the morning of January 5, 2004, in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He hosted a highly rated show at San Antonio's  [[KSRX]]  K-Rock until early August 2005.\n\n==Philadelphia developments==\nKiddChris signed with Philadelphia rock station [[WIP-FM|WYSP]] and The KiddChris Show began broadcasting on Monday, August 29, 2005. While Chris has made remarks that the show is \"gay\" and that \"it'll be gone in six months,\" that incarnation show lasted for over two years, and the station exercised their right to extend his contract for one more.\n\nOn August 21, 2006, it was announced that The KiddChris Show had been syndicated to a rock station in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The show entered syndication on August 28, 2006.\n\nOn September 13, 2007, the Philadelphia station announced a format change from all talk to a rock/talk hybrid. The official change, which left KiddChris on during the drive-time hours of 3pm-7pm, was announced during the KiddChris Show. Moments before the announcement, Chris, with [[Opie and Anthony]] in-studio, commented that \"It would be a hoot if they fired us live right after the big announcement.\" After announcing the format change, the station dropped to music and The KiddChris Show did not return to the air, causing confusion on multiple listener-run message boards as to their fate. On September 14, 2007, Chris appeared on The [[Opie and Anthony]] show and there was no mentioning of a firing.\n\nThe show returned to the air on September 17, 2007, but with old recordings in-between music, leaving fans of the show confused as to its fate. Soon after, Chris stated that they needed to \"establish the rock first. The show WILL be back\", which confirmed the statements made by other sources that the show will be returning to its original form.\n\nOn the  [[Howard Stern]]  Show on October 22, 2007, KiddChris called in to discuss Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. Howard quickly turned the topic of conversation to Chris' employment at the station, claiming a \"pretty good source\" told him Chris would take over the morning slot from [[Opie and Anthony]] relatively soon. Chris had no comment on the rumor.\n\nOn October 23, 2007, the Philadelphia rock station ended their syndication of [[Opie and Anthony]]'s morning show. There was no mention of it on-air by Chris. KiddChris ended his show that night unexpectedly with  [[Journey (band)|Journey]] 's \"Don't Stop Believin'.\" He has stated on-air in the past that if anything were to \"go down\" in regards to the show, he would play that song (though he originally claimed the song would play in the background and he would continue on as if nothing was happening). No morning or afternoon show aired for about a month.\n\nOn November 6, 2007, KiddChris was called by possible evening DJ Tic-Tac about his future with the station. In so many words, he stated that he \"will be back\", but claimed not to know when or in what time slot. Callers asked whether he was joining the  [[Howard Stern]]  Show staff and he said that would be impossible since he is staying in Philadelphia. He reminded fans that if he was fired, he would no longer be featured on the website.\n\nDuring the week of November 18, 2007, Chris's website was changed to a countdown with the tagline \"Are You Ready?\", set to end on Monday, November 26 at 6 AM. The countdown also appeared on his MySpace page. Prior to this, the station began to air short recordings featuring the \"Are You Ready?\" tagline, as well as the opening of \"The Game\" by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] (the theme song of The KiddChris Show).

However, there was no official voiceover to these clips, no direct mention of \"The KiddChris Show\" or any date of return.\n\nThe KiddChris Show officially returned to the airwaves on Monday, November 26, 2007, at 6 AM EST. \"[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]\" reporter Michael Klein reported in his Sunday column of the return of the Kidd Show. The show's move to the morning slot was notable for a few reasons. It replaced the [[Opie and Anthony]] Show.

(AKA '''Foley''' / '''Cobra''' / '''The Chris''' / '''Chris Himself''') (born 1974) is an [[United States|American]] [[radio host]]. He has hosted radio shows in several cities since 1998. KiddChris currently host the KiddChris show on  [[WEBN]]  in Cincinnati OH.\n\nThe radio show originated in his home town of [[Syracuse, New York]]. His controversial radio show made way to [[Wichita, Kansas]] ( [[KICT-FM|KICT]]  T-95FM,  [[KDGS]]  Power 93.9FM,  [[KHLT-FM|KANR]] FLY 92.7FM) which raised the ire of local church groups. Many religious organizations attempted to band together and remove KiddChris from the airwaves, but he remained on the air.\n\nChris then moved on to [[Sacramento, California]] where he hosted a morning show on a hip-hop station  [[KSFM]]. After several months, he moved into an evening show on sister FM talk station  [[KYRV|KXOA]] . KiddChris's four-hour talk show was one of the highest-rated radio shows on the Pacific coast. While in Sacramento, Chris gained national attention by sending a series of prank phone calls made to [[O.J. Simpson]] to the popular [[Opie and Anthony]] and [[Howard Stern]] nationally syndicated shows and Thomas Kitajima eventually joined the show in Sacramento.\n\nIn the fall of 2002, KiddChris took a hiatus from radio and retired to upstate New York. There, he rejuvenated himself and prepared for his return, which occurred on the morning of January 5, 2004, in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He hosted a highly rated show at San Antonio's  [[KSRX]]  K-Rock until early August 2005.\n\n==Philadelphia developments==\nKiddChris signed with Philadelphia rock station [[WIP-FM|WYSP]] and The KiddChris Show began broadcasting on Monday, August 29, 2005. While Chris has made remarks that the show is \"gay\" and that \"it'll be gone in six months,\" that incarnation show lasted for over two years, and the station exercised their right to extend his contract for one more.\n\nOn August 21, 2006, it was announced that The KiddChris Show had been syndicated to a rock station in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The show entered syndication on August 28, 2006.\n\nOn September 13, 2007, the Philadelphia station announced a format change from all talk to a rock/talk hybrid. The official change, which left KiddChris on during the drive-time hours of 3pm-7pm, was announced during the KiddChris Show. Moments before the announcement, Chris, with [[Opie and Anthony]] in-studio, commented that \"It would be a hoot if they fired us live right after the big announcement.\" After announcing the format change, the station dropped to music and The KiddChris Show did not return to the air, causing confusion on multiple listener-run message boards as to their fate. On September 14, 2007, Chris appeared on The [[Opie and Anthony]] show and there was no mentioning of a firing.\n\nThe show returned to the air on September 17, 2007, but with old recordings in-between music, leaving fans of the show confused as to its fate. Soon after, Chris stated that they needed to \"establish the rock first. The show WILL be back\", which confirmed the statements made by other sources that the show will be returning to its original form.\n\nOn the  [[Howard Stern]]  Show on October 22, 2007, KiddChris called in to discuss Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. Howard quickly turned the topic of conversation to Chris' employment at the station, claiming a \"pretty good source\" told him Chris would take over the morning slot from [[Opie and Anthony]] relatively soon. Chris had no comment on the rumor.\n\nOn October 23, 2007, the Philadelphia rock station ended their syndication of [[Opie and Anthony]]'s morning show. There was no mention of it on-air by Chris. KiddChris ended his show that night unexpectedly with  [[Journey (band)|Journey]] 's \"Don't Stop Believin'.\" He has stated on-air in the past that if anything were to \"go down\" in regards to the show, he would play that song (though he originally claimed the song would play in the background and he would continue on as if nothing was happening). No morning or afternoon show aired for about a month.\n\nOn November 6, 2007, KiddChris was called by possible evening DJ Tic-Tac about his future with the station. In so many words, he stated that he \"will be back\", but claimed not to know when or in what time slot. Callers asked whether he was joining the  [[Howard Stern]]  Show staff and he said that would be impossible since he is staying in Philadelphia. He reminded fans that if he was fired, he would no longer be featured on the website.\n\nDuring the week of November 18, 2007, Chris's website was changed to a countdown with the tagline \"Are You Ready?\", set to end on Monday, November 26 at 6 AM. The countdown also appeared on his MySpace page. Prior to this, the station began to air short recordings featuring the \"Are You Ready?\" tagline, as well as the opening of \"The Game\" by  [[Motorhead]]  (the theme song of The KiddChris Show). The recordings varied; they included short clips from the show, clips from Brad the Cripple interviews, recordings of callers asking what happened to the show and if he was going to return in mornings and  [[Howard Stern]]  discussing the future of KiddChris in morning drive. However, there was no official voiceover to these clips, no direct mention of \"The KiddChris Show\" or any date of return.\n\nThe KiddChris Show officially returned to the airwaves on Monday, November 26, 2007, at 6 AM EST. \"[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]\" reporter Michael Klein reported in his Sunday column of the return of the Kidd Show. The show's move to the morning slot was notable for a few reasons. It replaced the [[Opie and Anthony]] Show. In January, the show was second to rival Philadelphia morning show hosts  [[Preston and Steve]]  among men ages 18\u201334.\n\nIn May 2008,  KiddChris was fired over the guest's racist parody song 3 months after it was aired.

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925\u20131931. From 1934\u20131941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The district attorney issued two letters of apology to the Quigleys, saying he found no evidence that either had engaged in \"anti-Semitic conduct or harassment.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/us/privacy-rights-win-over-bias-charges-in-defamation-case.html | work=The New York Times | title=Privacy Rights Win Over Bias Charges In Defamation Case | date=May 13, 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe Quigleys brought a lawsuit against ADL, Rosenthal, the Aronsons, and two ADL volunteer attorneys. The two attorneys agreed to pay $350,000 to the Quigleys in settlement of their claims. The Quigley settlement with the Aronsons did not involve a cash payment. The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]]. According to a report in the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', with accrued interest, the judgment amounted to more than $12 million.<ref>{{cite news  |title=ADL Pays More Than $12 Million to Former Evergreen Couple |date=March 12, 2004 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |last=Abbott |first=Karen}}</ref>\n\n=== New antisemitism controversy ===\n{{Main|New antisemitism}}\nA book entitled ''The [[New Anti-Semitism]]'' (New York, 1974) by ADL national leaders Arnold Forster and Benjamin R.

The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism'' (San Francisco, 2003), by ADL's national director Abraham Foxman, he states on page 4: \"We currently face as great a threat to the safety and security of the Jewish people as the one we faced in the 1930s\u2014if not a greater one.\"<ref name=\"adl.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/never_again.asp |title=Never Again?

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service, and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award. The manga is licensed for English release in North America by [[Viz Media]], while the anime is licensed by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nLegoshi, a large gray [[wolf]], is a timid and quiet student of Cherryton Academy where he lives in a dorm with several other carnivorous students including his outgoing [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] friend, Jack. As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students. At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small [[dwarf rabbit]], and begins developing complex feelings for her.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Nihongo|'''Legoshi'''|\u30ec\u30b4\u30b7|Regoshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Chikahiro Kobayashi<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-07/chikahiro-kobayashi-sayaka-senbongi-star-in-beastars-anime/.148771|title=Chikahiro Kobayashi, Sayaka Senbongi Star in BEASTARS Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2019|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref>|Jonah Scott<ref name=\"Beastars ENG Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Mateo |first1=Alex |title=BEASTARS Anime Reveals English Dub Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-20/beastars-anime-reveals-english-dub-cast/.156674 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 20, 2020 |date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Legoshi, 17 years old at the start of the story,<ref name=Vol1ENVizp204>{{cite book|author=Itagaki, Paru|translator=Tomoko Kimura|title=Beastars|language=en|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|date=July 2019|volume=1|page=204}} - First printing, and Annette Roman did the adaptation.</ref> is a towering gray [[wolf]] with a quiet personality contrasting his appearance.

He attempts to hide his more terrifying traits in order to better acquaint his herbivorous classmates. He takes it upon himself to solve the murder of Tem.

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service, and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award. The manga is licensed for English release in North America by [[Viz Media]], while the anime is licensed by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nLegoshi, a large gray [[wolf]], is a timid and quiet student of Cherryton Academy where he lives in a dorm with several other carnivorous students including his outgoing [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] friend, Jack. As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students. At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small [[dwarf rabbit]], and begins developing complex feelings for her.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Nihongo|'''Legoshi'''|\u30ec\u30b4\u30b7|Regoshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Chikahiro Kobayashi<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-07/chikahiro-kobayashi-sayaka-senbongi-star-in-beastars-anime/.148771|title=Chikahiro Kobayashi, Sayaka Senbongi Star in BEASTARS Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2019|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref>|Jonah Scott<ref name=\"Beastars ENG Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Mateo |first1=Alex |title=BEASTARS Anime Reveals English Dub Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-20/beastars-anime-reveals-english-dub-cast/.156674 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 20, 2020 |date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Legoshi, 17 years old at the start of the story,<ref name=Vol1ENVizp204>{{cite book|author=Itagaki, Paru|translator=Tomoko Kimura|title=Beastars|language=en|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|date=July 2019|volume=1|page=204}} - First printing, and Annette Roman did the adaptation.</ref> is a towering gray [[wolf]] with a quiet personality contrasting his appearance.

During the making of the track, four additional studios (Roundhouse, [[Sarm East Studios]], [[Scorpio Sound]], and [[Wessex Sound Studios]]) were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Mercury used a [[C.

In the end, eighth-generation tapes were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The various sections of tape containing the desired sub-mixes had to be [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|spliced]] (cut and assembled in the correct sequence). May recalled placing a tape in front of the light and being able to see through it, as the tape had been used so many times.{{Sfn|Classic Albums | 2006}} A similar story was told in 1977 by Taylor regarding the elaborate overdubs and sub-mixes for \"The March of The Black Queen\" for the album ''[[Queen II]]''.

May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\". The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working: in which he thought of the tune before playing it: \"the fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.\"{{Sfn | BBC| 2004b}} According to Baker, \"the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with [[mix automation|automation]]...

The lyrics question whether life is \"real\" or \"just fantasy caught in a [[landslide]]\" before concluding that there can be \"no escape from reality\".\n\nAfter 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, the song modulates briefly to E{{Music|flat}} major and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker whereas the \"little low\" comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere. The end of this section is marked by the bass entrance and the cross-handed piano [[vamp (music)|vamp]] in B{{Music|flat}}.\n\n===Ballad (0:49\u20132:37)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody Mama.ogg\n|title = \"Mama, just killed a man\"\n|description = This sample features the distinctive piano phrase in B{{Music|flat}} and the first line of the first verse.\n}}\nThe piano begins in B{{Music|flat}} major along with the entrance of [[John Deacon]]'s bass guitar, marking the onset of this section. After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man,\" with \"a gun against his head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\n\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\n\n===Guitar solo (2:37\u20133:05)===\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and originally composed by Mercury, later improvised by May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34651067|title=Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car'|last=May|first=Brian|date=29 October 2015|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\n\n===Opera (3:05\u20134:07)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg\n|title = \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\"\n|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.\n}}\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\". Also, on \"Let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\n\nLyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", while others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]\". According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!\", on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).\n\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\n=== Hard rock (4:07\u20134:54)===\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].\n\n===Outro (4:54\u20135:55)===\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"[[Deacy Amp]]\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\n\n==Lyrics==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\"{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\n{{quote box\n| salign = left\n| quote = It's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it. I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them... \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" didn't just come out of thin air.

Why not?\n| source = \u2014Freddie Mercury{{Sfn|Davis|1993|p=20}}\n| align = left\n| width = 33%\n}}\n\nWhen the band released a ''Greatest Hits'' cassette in Iran, a leaflet in [[Farsi language|Persian]] was included with translation and explanations (refers to a book published in Iran called ''The March of the Black Queen'' by Sarah Sefati and Farhad Arkani, which included the whole biography of the band and complete lyrics with Persian translation (2000)). In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"[[Basmala|Bismillah]]\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}\n\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".{{Sfn|Black|2002}}\n\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked\u2014Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David \"Diddy\" Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show. Hall stated \"Monster, Monster! This could be a hit!\"<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv|first=Lesley-Ann |last=Jones |authorlink=Lesley-Ann Jones |title=Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography |publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]] |page=151 |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-44473-369-3}}</ref>\n\nThe song became the 1975 [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|UK Christmas number one]], holding the top position for nine weeks.{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was the first song ever to get to number one in the UK twice with the same version,{{Sfn|BBC|2005}} and is also the only single to have been Christmas number one twice with the same version. The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\") in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.\n\nIn the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.<ref name=\"BillboardYE1976\" /> With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.<ref name=\"RPMTop100\"/>\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research. The song re-entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart after 16 years, reaching number two and spending 17 weeks on the chart, with a year-end chart position of 39.

A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'', since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \"Magnifico\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], a glare analogous to [[audio feedback]]. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on ''Top of the Pops'' in November 1975.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} After a few weeks at number one, an edit of the video was created.

The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of ''[[NME]]'' observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does.

'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that [[Pete Townshend|Pete Townsend]] [''sic''] used to tack on to the end of [[The Who|Who]] albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating.

He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".<ref name=\"Eisentraut\"/> Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".<ref name=\"Lambe\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted [[novelty song]] ever recorded\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/668 668]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/668}}</ref> Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2015, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s music critic [[Greg Kot]] called it a \"prog-rock pocket [[operetta]]\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".<ref name=\"Kot\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s music critic, [[Tom Service]], examined the song's relationship with the traditions of [[classical music]], describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\":\n\n{{quote|The precedents of Bohemian Rhapsody are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] or [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] or the tone-poems of [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]] or [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975. That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense. It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] or the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.<ref name=\"service\"/>}}\n\nComparison was also made between the song and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 epic \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" by music writers [[Pete Prown]] and [[HP Newquist]]. They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed [[Folk music|folk]] influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".<ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".

Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative ... forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\".{{Sfn|Gracyk|2007|p=63}} Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.{{Sfn|Gracyk|2007|p=65}}\n\nIn connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band. Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from ''Wayne's World'' with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band. He said, \"they've just [[Urination|whizzed]] on a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].\" He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea, and that he apologised to them. The band, though, sent a reply simply saying, \"Thank you for using our song.\" This astonished Myers, who responded, \"Thank you for even letting me touch the hem of your garments!\"<ref>''Made in Heaven'' video documentary \"Champions of the World.\"</ref>\n\nThe ''Wayne's World'' video version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" won Queen its only [[MTV Video Music Award]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film|Best Video from a Film]]\".{{Sfn|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}} When remaining members Brian May and Roger Taylor took the stage to accept the award, Brian May was overcome with emotion and said that \"Freddie would be tickled.\" In the final scene of the video, a pose of the band from the video from the original \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" clip [[morphing|morphs]] into an identically posed 1985 photo, first featured in the \"[[One Vision]]\" video.\n\nIn the 2018 Queen biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'', Myers has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as a fictional record executive who pans the song and refuses to release it as a single, proclaiming that it is too long for radio and that it is not a song that \"teenagers can crank up the volume in their car and bang their heads to\", a reference to the iconic scene in ''Wayne's World''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mike Myers references 'Wayne's World' during his 'Bohemian Rhapsody' cameo |url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/mike-myers-bohemian-rhapsody-waynes-world-2393931 |accessdate=12 November 2018 |agency=NME}}</ref>\n\n===Achievements and accolades===\nThe song has won numerous awards, and has been covered and parodied by many artists.

As the heavy rock segment followed, the band would return to the stage.\n}}\nThe ''a cappella'' opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's ''a cappella'' opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the [[Hot Space Tour]], and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three members of the group during a live performance in Hanover. From left to right, John Deacon (stood casually), Roger Taylor (playing, sat at drum kit), and Brian May (appears to be playing intensely).

Behind the drum kit is the [[tam-tam]] used at the end of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".]]\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the [[Sheer Heart Attack Tour|Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[A Night at the Opera Tour|A Night at the Opera]] tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"[[Killer Queen]]\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonh-ingham.blogspot.ca/2007/02/queen-riot-at-opera.html|title=Queen: A Riot At The Opera|author=Ingham, John|date=29 November 1975|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\n\nStarting with the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of [[pyrotechnics]] after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], with [[Elton John]] singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, [[Axl Rose]] singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.{{Sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Footage from the ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'' was used for the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005-6 tour]], and the [[Queen Rock Montreal|1981 Montreal performance]] used for the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]]. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience. Commenting upon this staging, Brian May says that they \"had to rise to the challenge of getting Freddie in there in a way which gave him his rightful place, but without demeaning Paul in any way. It also kept us live and 'present', although conscious and proud of our past, as we logically should be.\"{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\nSince 2012, May and Taylor have toured with former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Adam Lambert]] under the name [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] (following two one-off performances together in 2009 and 2011), with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" regularly included at the end of their set.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Simpson |title=Queen and Adam Lambert review \u2013 an unlikely union, but it works |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/14/queen-adam-lambert-live-review-arena-newcastle |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=Ellise |last=Shafer |title=Queen and Adam Lambert Play the Hits, Pay Tribute to Freddie Mercury at L.A.

In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"[[The Prophet's Song]]\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.<ref>Freddie Mercury Interview, January 1976, ''Sounds''</ref>|Freddie Mercury, 1976}}\n\n{{quote|When we finished the album, the ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.|John Deacon, 1977}}\n\n{{quote|The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done. I knew what kind of melody I wanted to play.|Brian May, 1982}}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n* [[Freddie Mercury]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, piano, [[Opera#Operatic voices|operatic vocals]] (middle register)\n* [[Brian May]] \u2013 electric guitar, operatic vocals (low register)\n* [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] \u2013 drums, [[timpani]], [[gong]], operatic vocals (high register)\n* [[John Deacon]] \u2013 bass guitar\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bohemian Rhapsody cover versions]]\n* [[List of best-selling singles]]\n* [[List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of best-selling singles in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}Bohemian Rhapsody is about Richard Dodd\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hodkinson|first=Mark|year=2004|title=Queen: The Early Years|publisher=Music Sales Ltd|isbn=1-84449-012-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Pope|first=Rob|year=2002|title=The English Studies Book: An Introduction to Language, Literature and Culture|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-25709-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|work=BBC News|date=15 June 2011|title=Smashed Hits: What is a Bohemian Rhapsody?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13761091|accessdate=25 September 2017|ref={{SfnRef|BBC|2011}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Corn|first=John|year=2005|title=Britain Since 1948|publisher=Folens Publishers|isbn=1-84303-985-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Heatley|first=Michael|year=2008|title=Massive Music Moments|publisher=Collins and Brown|isbn=1-84340-493-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite video|people=Directed by Carl Johnston|date=4 December 2004|title=The Story of Bohemian Rhapsody|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438465/|medium=Television production|publisher=BBC|ref={{SfnRef|BBC|2004b}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Peraino|first=Judith|year=2005|title=Listening to the Sirens: Musical Technologies of Queer Identity from Homer to Hedwig|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21587-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news|last=Chiu|first=David|title=Unconventional Queen Hit Still Rocks After 30 Years|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 April 2010|url=https://nytimes.com/2005/12/27/arts/music/27quee.html?ex=1293339600anden=5825caa9f4db1fb0andei=5090|ref=harv|date=27 December 2005}}\n* {{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|title=Muppets' Bohemian Rhapsody takes YouTube by storm|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/6714562/Muppets-Bohemian-Rhapsody-takes-YouTube-by-storm.html|accessdate=10 April 2010|ref={{SfnRef|Daily Telegraph|2009}}|first=Nick|last=Allen|date=3 December 2009}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Andy|year=1993|title=Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody|work=Record Collector|issue=167|page=20|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Black |first=Johnny |year=2002 |title=The Greatest Songs Ever!

May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\".

The lyrics question whether life is \"real\" or \"just fantasy caught in a [[landslide]]\" before concluding that there can be \"no escape from reality\".\n\nAfter 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, the song modulates briefly to E{{Music|flat}} major and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker whereas the \"little low\" comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere.

After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man,\" with \"a gun against his head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\n\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\n\n===Guitar solo (2:37\u20133:05)===\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and originally composed by Mercury, later improvised by May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34651067|title=Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car'|last=May|first=Brian|date=29 October 2015|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\n\n===Opera (3:05\u20134:07)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg\n|title = \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\"\n|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.\n}}\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\". Also, on \"Let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\n\nLyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", while others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]\". According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!\", on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).\n\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\n=== Hard rock (4:07\u20134:54)===\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].\n\n===Outro (4:54\u20135:55)===\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"[[Deacy Amp]]\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\n\n==Lyrics==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\"{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\n{{quote box\n| salign = left\n| quote = It's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it.

In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"[[Basmala|Bismillah]]\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}\n\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".{{Sfn|Black|2002}}\n\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked\u2014Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David \"Diddy\" Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show.

The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.<ref name=\"BillboardYE1976\" /> With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.<ref name=\"RPMTop100\"/>\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research.

A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'', since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \"Magnifico\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], a glare analogous to [[audio feedback]]. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on ''Top of the Pops'' in November 1975.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} After a few weeks at number one, an edit of the video was created.

The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of ''[[NME]]'' observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does.

'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that [[Pete Townshend|Pete Townsend]] [''sic''] used to tack on to the end of [[The Who|Who]] albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating.

It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] or the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].

They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed [[Folk music|folk]] influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".<ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".

He said, \"they've just [[Urination|whizzed]] on a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].\" He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea, and that he apologised to them.

As the heavy rock segment followed, the band would return to the stage.\n}}\nThe ''a cappella'' opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's ''a cappella'' opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the [[Hot Space Tour]], and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three members of the group during a live performance in Hanover. From left to right, John Deacon (stood casually), Roger Taylor (playing, sat at drum kit), and Brian May (appears to be playing intensely).

Behind that is a large set of multicoloured lights raised above the stage.|From left to right: Deacon, Taylor and May in concert in [[Hanover]] in 1979. Behind the drum kit is the [[tam-tam]] used at the end of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".]]\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the [[Sheer Heart Attack Tour|Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[A Night at the Opera Tour|A Night at the Opera]] tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"[[Killer Queen]]\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonh-ingham.blogspot.ca/2007/02/queen-riot-at-opera.html|title=Queen: A Riot At The Opera|author=Ingham, John|date=29 November 1975|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\n\nStarting with the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of [[pyrotechnics]] after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], with [[Elton John]] singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, [[Axl Rose]] singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.{{Sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Footage from the ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'' was used for the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005-6 tour]], and the [[Queen Rock Montreal|1981 Montreal performance]] used for the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]]. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience. Commenting upon this staging, Brian May says that they \"had to rise to the challenge of getting Freddie in there in a way which gave him his rightful place, but without demeaning Paul in any way. It also kept us live and 'present', although conscious and proud of our past, as we logically should be.\"{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\nSince 2012, May and Taylor have toured with former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Adam Lambert]] under the name [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] (following two one-off performances together in 2009 and 2011), with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" regularly included at the end of their set.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Simpson |title=Queen and Adam Lambert review \u2013 an unlikely union, but it works |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/14/queen-adam-lambert-live-review-arena-newcastle |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=Ellise |last=Shafer |title=Queen and Adam Lambert Play the Hits, Pay Tribute to Freddie Mercury at L.A.

In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"[[The Prophet's Song]]\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.<ref>Freddie Mercury Interview, January 1976, ''Sounds''</ref>|Freddie Mercury, 1976}}\n\n{{quote|When we finished the album, the ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.|John Deacon, 1977}}\n\n{{quote|The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination.

{"title_page": "Marine engineering", "text_new": "{{short description|Engineering of boats, ships, oil rigs or other marine vessel or structure}}\n{{About|a field of design engineering|the operating engineer also called a marine engineer|engineering officer (ship)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Marine-engineering.jpg|thumb|Marine engineers reviewing ship plans]]\n'''Marine engineering''' includes the [[engineering]] of [[watercraft|boats, ships, oil rigs and any other marine vessel]] or structure, as well as '''oceanographic engineering''' or '''ocean engineering'''. Specifically, marine engineering is the discipline of applying engineering sciences, including [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], and [[computer science]], to the development, design, operation and maintenance of [[Marine propulsion|watercraft propulsion]] and on-board systems and oceanographic technology. It includes but is not limited to power and propulsion plants, machinery, piping, automation and control systems for marine vehicles of any kind, such as surface ships and submarines.\n\n==History==\n[[Archimedes]] is traditionally regarded as the first marine engineer, having developed a number of marine engineering systems in antiquity. Modern marine engineering dates back to the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (early 1700s).\n===Marine steam engineering===\nIn 1712, [[Thomas Newcomen]], a [[blacksmith]], created a [[steam powered]] [[engine]] to pump water out of [[mining|mines]]. In 1807, [[Robert Fulton]] successfully used a [[steam engine]] to propel a vessel through the water. Fulton's ship used the engine to power a small wooden [[paddle wheel]] as its [[marine propulsion]] system. The integration of a steam engine into a [[watercraft]] to create a [[marine steam engine]] was the start of the marine engineering profession.\n===Paddle wheel ships===\n[[Paddle steamers]] were the front runners of the industry for the next thirty years till the next type of propulsion came around. Only twelve years after Fulton\u2019s [[North River Steamboat|''Clermont'']] had her first voyage, the [[SS Savannah|''Savannah'']] marked the first sea voyage from America to Europe. Around 50 years later the steam powered paddle wheels had a peak with the creation of the [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']], which was as big as one of the cargo ships of today, 700 feet in length, weighing 22,000 tons. The ''Great Eastern'' was said to be ahead of its time and was destined for failure. Since the 1800s there have been many improvements to the design of engines and propellers. The [[maritime industry]] holds 90% of all international trade.<ref>Kane, J.R. (1971). Marine Engineering. New York: SNAME(page 2-3)</ref>\n\n=== '''Diesel Engines'''  ===\nOn a ship the main engine is the beating hart of the ship and often times the largest piece of equipment in the engine room. The main job of the engine is to provide power to the [[propeller]] which intern gives the ship propulsion. In other words, the ship would not be able to maneuver without the main engine. Although many different kinds of engines have been developed over the years the most common today would have to be the [[diesel engine]].\n\nAlthough there are many types of diesel engines all operate on the same principals. Fuel is injected into a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] which uses high pressure in order to ignite the fuel <ref>Taylor, D. (1996). Introduction to marine engineering (2nd ed., rev. ed.). Oxford ; Boston: Butterworth Heinemann.</ref>. This type of ignition system is called an [[internal combustion engine]]. The energy that is created by igniting the pressurized fuel air mixtures is exerted on the piston head forcing it down, this motion is transmitted from a reciprocating motion into a rotational motion by the crankshaft <ref>Russell, P., Morton, T., Jackson, L., & Prince, A. (2018). Motor engineering knowledge for marine engineers (5th ed., Reeds marine engineering and technology; v. 12). London ; New York: Reeds.</ref>. There are three different classifications of a diesel engine: slow, medium, and high speed. This refers to the [[Revolutions per minute|revolutions per minute (rpm)]] that the engine is able to put out. Slow speed engines range from 0-300 rpm, medium speed 300-800 rpm, and high-speed engines are 800 rpm and above <ref>\u2022\tRussell, P., Morton, T., Jackson, L., & Prince, A. (2018). Motor engineering knowledge for marine engineers (5th ed., Reeds marine engineering and technology; v. 12). London ; New York: Reeds.</ref>.\n\nIn the maritime industry there are two distinct types of engines, the [[Two-stroke engine|two stroke]] and the [[Four-stroke engine|four strokes]]. On a ship both require the same five supporting systems in order to operate efficiently; lubrication, cooling, exhaust, fuel injection, and air intake <ref>Bureau of Naval Personnel, (1970), Principals of Naval Engineering, U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\nThe largest difference between the tow engines would have to be the cycles of each engine. While the four stroke takes two revolutions in order to complete one cycle the two strokes only takes one stroke <ref>Taylor, D. (1996). Introduction to marine engineering (2nd ed., rev. ed.). Oxford ; Boston: Butterworth Heinemann.</ref>. Another key difference between the two would be that a two stoke engine does not use an intake valve, instead it has a [[Scavenging (engine)|scavenging port]] <ref>Brady, Robert N, (1996). Modern diesel technology, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice Hall</ref>. The more common one of the two would have to be a four-stroke engine due to its better fuel efficiency across a wider range of rpm. One advantage of a two stoke engine is that it is considered simpler due to the fact that it has fewer moving parts, this also allows the two-stroke engine to be smaller and more compact <ref>Russell, P., Jackson, L., & Morton, T. (2018). General engineering knowledge for marine engineers (6th ed., Reeds marine engineering and technology; 8). London ; New York: Reeds.</ref>.\n\n=== Ocean Liners ===\nOcean Liners were the result of the steam engine and new innovations in ship propulsion using propellers. They are passenger vessels designed to transport people by water from one location to the other in a fairly short amount of time. In 1840, [[Samuel Cunard]] began operating ocean liners in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and around [[Great Britain]]. Eventually, [[Cunard Line|Cunard Lines]] grew to be one of the biggest leaders of the industry along with various U.S. and French ships. While Ocean liners are no longer in demand due to the use of [[Airplane|airplanes]], in the mid-19th century they were the most prestigious way to travel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/ocean-liner|title=Ocean liner {{!}} ship|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Cruise Ships ===\nCruise ships took their place after ocean liners began to fade from the industry due to less demand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://porteconomicsmanagement.org/?page_id=1386|title=Chapter 7.1 \u2013 Cruise Ports|date=2020-02-03|website=Port Economics, Management and Policy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> These ocean liners were repurposed as cruise ships offering amenities, food, and trips to various ports of call. Many cruise lines were founded towards the end of the 1960s and into the early 1970s and had their engineers completely transform ships to better fit the cruising industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncl.com/about|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Norwegian Cruise Line|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carnival.com/about-carnival/about-us.aspx|title=About Us|last=Line|first=Carnival Cruise|website=Carnival Cruise Line|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Ever since then, cruise lines and their engineers are aiming to have the most innovative fleet of ships and continue to transform the industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalcaribbean.com/aboutus|title=Executives Biography {{!}} Royal Caribbean International|website=www.royalcaribbean.com|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Cargo Ships ===\n[[File:Jeremiah o'brien.jpg|thumb|133x133px|One of two liberty ships that are still operational]]\nUnlike the engineers of ocean liners, cargo vessels transformed from [[Steam engine|steam]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]] much earlier on as they provided more power and [[propulsion]] necessary for moving the large loads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/ship|title=Ship - Cargo ships|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> These kinds of vessels carry very large loads onboard to transport all over the world.\n\n===Offshore oil rigs===\nMarine engineers work on more than [[marine engines]]. Marine engineers are also responsible for building and maintaining [[Oil platform|offshore oil rigs]]. These oil rigs were first made by Henry L. Williams in 1896.<ref>Bruce A. Wells, (2003) Offshore Petroleum History, American Oil and Gas Historical Society. Retrieved 4/10/14 http://aoghs.org/offshore-exploration/offshore-oil-history/</ref>\n\n==Marine engineering specialties==\n\n===Naval architect===\n\n[[Naval architecture|Naval architects]] are concerned with the overall design of the ship and its propulsion through the water. This is the first step in the overall design of the ship and creates the guidelines that will lead to the actual construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webb.edu/about-webb-institute/what-is-a-naval-architect/|title=What is Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering?|website=Webb Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanical engineering===\n\nMechanical engineers design the main [[propulsion]] plant, the powering and mechanization aspects of the ship functions such as steering, [[anchor]]ing, [[cargo#Marine|cargo]] handling, heating, ventilation, air conditioning interior and exterior communication, and other related requirements.  [[Electrical power generation]] and [[electrical power distribution]] systems are typically designed by their suppliers; only installation is the design responsibility of the marine engineer.\n\n===Oceanographic engineering===\nOceanographic engineering is concerned with mechanical, electrical, and electronic, and computing technology deployed to support [[oceanography]], and also falls under the umbrella of marine engineering, especially in Britain, where it is covered by the same professional organisation, the [[IMarEST]].\n\n===Offshore engineering===\n\nCivil engineering for an offshore environment, the design and construction of fixed and floating marine structures, such as [[oil platform]]s and [[offshore wind farm]]s is generally called ''offshore engineering''.\n\n==Challenges specific to marine engineering==\n===Hydrodynamic loading===\nIn the same way that civil engineers design to accommodate wind loads on building and bridges, maritime engineers design to accommodate a ship being flexed or a platform being struck by waves millions of times in its life.\n\n===Stability===\nA naval architect, like an airplane designer, is concerned with [[Ship stability|stability]].  The naval architect's job is different, insofar as a ship operates in two fluids simultaneously: water and air. Engineers also face the challenge of balancing cargo as the mass of the ship increase and the center of gravity shifts higher as additional containers are stacked vertically. In addition, the weight of fuel presents a problem as the pitch of the ship cause the weight to shift with the liquid causing an imbalance. This offset is counteracted by water inside larger [[ballast]] tanks. Engineers are faced with the task of balancing and tracking the fuel and ballast water of a ship.\n\n===Corrosion===\nThe chemical environment faced by ships and offshore structures is far harsher than nearly anywhere on land, save chemical plants.  Marine engineers are concerned with surface protection and preventing [[galvanic corrosion]] in every project. \u00a0 [[Corrosion]] can be inhibited through [[cathodic protection]] by utilizing pieces of metal known as sacrificial anodes. A piece of metal such as zinc is used as the sacrificial anode as it becomes the anode in the chemical reaction. This causes the metal to corrode and not the ship\u2019s hull. Another way to prevent corrosion is by sending a controlled amount of low DC current to the ship\u2019s hull to prevent the process of electro-chemical corrosion. This changes the electrical charge of the ship\u2019s hull to prevent electro-chemical corrosion.\n\n=== Anti-fouling ===\nAnti-fouling is the process of eliminating obstructive organisms from essential components of seawater systems. Marine organisms grow and attach to the surfaces of the outboard suction inlets used to obtain water for cooling systems. [[Electrochlorination|Electro-chlorination]] involves running high electrical current through sea water. The combination of current and sea water alters the chemical composition to create [[sodium hypochlorite]] to purge any bio-matter.  An electrolytic method of anti-fowling involves running electrical current through two anodes (Scardino, 2009).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Fouling control using air bubble curtains: protection for stationary vessel.|journal = Journal of Marine Engineering & Technology|volume = 8|pages = 3\u201310|last=Scardino|date=2009|doi = 10.1080/20464177.2009.11020214|doi-access = free}}</ref> These anodes typically consist of copper and aluminum (or iron). The copper [[anode]] releases its ion into the water creating an environment that is too toxic for bio-matter. The second metal, aluminum, coats the inside of the pipes to help prevent corrosion. Other forms of marine growth such as mussels and algae may attach themselves to the bottom of a ship's hull. This causes the ship to have a less hydrodynamic shape since it would not be uniform and smooth around the hull. This creates the problem of less fuel efficiency as it slows down the vessel (IMO, 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Anti-foulingSystems/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Anti-Fouling Systems|date=2018|website=International Maritime Organization}}</ref> This issue can be remedied by using special paint that prevent the growth of such organisms.\n\n=== Pollution control ===\n\n==== Sulfur emission ====\n\nThe burning of marine fuels has the potential to release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Ships burn marine diesel in addition to [[heavy fuel oil]]. Heavy fuel oil, being the heaviest of [[Refined oil products|refined oils]], releases [[sulfur dioxide]] when burned. [[Sulfur dioxide emissions]] have the potential to raise atmospheric and [[ocean acidity]] causing harm to marine life. However, heavy fuel oil may only be burned in [[international waters]] due to the pollution created. It is commercially advantageous due to the cost effectiveness compared to other marine fuels. It is prospected that heavy fuel oil will be phased out of commercial use by the year 2020 (Smith, 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritimepropulsion.com|title=Eco Ships:The New Norm for Top Tier Ships|last=Smith|date=2018|website=Maritime Reporter and Engineering News}}</ref>\n\n==== Oil and water discharge ====\n\nWater, oil, and other substances collect at the bottom of the ship in what is known as the bilge. Bilge water is pumped overboard, but must pass a pollution threshold test of 15 ppm (parts per million) of oil to be discharged. Water is tested and either discharged if clean or recirculated to a holding tank to be separated before being tested again. The tank it is sent back to, the oily water separator, utilizes gravity to separate the fluids due to their viscosity. Ships over 400 gross tons  are required to carry the equipment to separate oil from bilge water. Further, as enforced by MARPOL, all ships over 400 gross tons and all oil tankers over 150 gross tons are require to log all oil transfer is an oil record book (EPA, 2011).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/vgp_bilge.pdf|title=Oily Bilgewater Separators|date=2011|website=Environmental Protection Agency Office of Wastewater Management United States}}</ref>\n\n=== Cavitation ===\n[[Cavitation]] is the process of forming an air bubble in a liquid due to the vaporization of that liquid cause by an area of low pressure. This area of low pressure lowers the boiling point of a liquid allowing it to vaporize into a gas. Cavitation can take place in pumps, which can cause damage to the impeller that moves the fluids through the system. Cavitation is also seen in propulsion. Low pressure pockets form on the surface of the propeller blades as its revolutions per minute increase (IIMS, 2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iims.org.uk/introduction-propeller-cavitation/|title=An Introduction to Propeller Cavitation|date=2015|website=International Institute of Maritime Surveying}}</ref> Cavitation on the propeller causes a small but violent implosion which could warp the propeller blade. To remedy the issue, more blades allow the same amount of propulsion force but at a lower rate of revolutions. This is crucial for submarines as the propeller needs to keep the vessel relatively quiet to stay hidden. With more propeller blades, the vessel is able to achieve the same amount of propulsion force at lower shaft revolutions.\n\n==== Prevention ====\nCavitation occurs when a change in pressure is found in a liquid which will cause the liquid to turn into a vapor <ref>Brady, Robert N, (1996). Modern diesel technology, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice Hall</ref>. This can be found on propellers and pumps that are pumping liquids. Cavitation will lead to premature erosion of the propeller and on the impeller of a [[centrifugal pump]]. One of the reasons that cavitation is so dangerous is that if this occurs in a fuel line there is a good chance that it could explode. One way to prevent this in a fuel system is to use [[Pump|positive displacement pumps]] instead of centrifugal pumps. When it comes to preventing cavitation on a propeller you can do two things, slow down the speed of the propeller or increase the number of props <ref>\u2022\tRussell, P., Jackson, L., & Morton, T.

Specifically, marine engineering is the discipline of applying engineering sciences, including [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], and [[computer science]], to the development, design, operation and maintenance of [[Marine propulsion|watercraft propulsion]] and on-board systems and oceanographic technology. It includes but is not limited to power and propulsion plants, machinery, piping, automation and control systems for marine vehicles of any kind, such as surface ships and submarines.\n\n==History==\n[[Archimedes]] is traditionally regarded as the first marine engineer, having developed a number of marine engineering systems in antiquity. Modern marine engineering dates back to the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (early 1700s).\n===Marine steam engineering===\nIn 1712, [[Thomas Newcomen]], a [[blacksmith]], created a [[steam powered]] [[engine]] to pump water out of [[mining|mines]]. In 1807, [[Robert Fulton]] successfully used a [[steam engine]] to propel a vessel through the water. Fulton's ship used the engine to power a small wooden [[paddle wheel]] as its [[marine propulsion]] system. The integration of a steam engine into a [[watercraft]] to create a [[marine steam engine]] was the start of the marine engineering profession.\n===Paddle wheel ships===\n[[Paddle steamers]] were the front runners of the industry for the next thirty years till the next type of propulsion came around. Only twelve years after Fulton\u2019s [[North River Steamboat|''Clermont'']] had her first voyage, the [[SS Savannah|''Savannah'']] marked the first sea voyage from America to Europe. Around 50 years later the steam powered paddle wheels had a peak with the creation of the [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']], which was as big as one of the cargo ships of today, 700 feet in length, weighing 22,000 tons. The ''Great Eastern'' was said to be ahead of its time and was destined for failure. Since the 1800s there have been many improvements to the design of engines and propellers. The [[maritime industry]] holds 90% of all international trade.<ref>Kane, J.R. (1971). Marine Engineering. New York: SNAME(page 2-3)</ref>\n\n=== '''Diesel Engines'''  ===\n<br />\n  On a ship the main engine is the beating hart of the ship and often times the largest piece of equipment in the engine room. The main job of the engine is to provide power to the [[propeller]] which intern gives the ship propulsion. In other words, the ship would not be able to maneuver without the main engine. Although many different kinds of engines have been developed over the years the most common today would have to be the [[diesel engine]].\n\n             Although there are many types of diesel engines all operate on the same principals. Fuel is injected into a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] which uses high pressure in order to ignite the fuel <ref>Taylor, D. (1996). Introduction to marine engineering (2nd ed., rev. ed.). Oxford ; Boston: Butterworth Heinemann.</ref>. This type of ignition system is called an [[internal combustion engine]]. The energy that is created by igniting the pressurized fuel air mixtures is exerted on the piston head forcing it down, this motion is transmitted from a reciprocating motion into a rotational motion by the crankshaft <ref>Russell, P., Morton, T., Jackson, L., & Prince, A. (2018). Motor engineering knowledge for marine engineers (5th ed., Reeds marine engineering and technology; v. 12). London ; New York: Reeds.</ref>. There are three different classifications of a diesel engine: slow, medium, and high speed. This refers to the [[Revolutions per minute|revolutions per minute (rpm)]] that the engine is able to put out. Slow speed engines range from 0-300 rpm, medium speed 300-800 rpm, and high-speed engines are 800 rpm and above <ref>\u2022\tRussell, P., Morton, T., Jackson, L., & Prince, A. (2018). Motor engineering knowledge for marine engineers (5th ed., Reeds marine engineering and technology; v. 12). London ; New York: Reeds.</ref>.\n\n             In the maritime industry there are two distinct types of engines, the [[Two-stroke engine|two stroke]] and the [[Four-stroke engine|four strokes]]. On a ship both require the same five supporting systems in order to operate efficiently; lubrication, cooling, exhaust, fuel injection, and air intake <ref>Bureau of Naval Personnel, (1970), Principals of Naval Engineering, U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>\nThe largest difference between the tow engines would have to be the cycles of each engine. While the four stroke takes two revolutions in order to complete one cycle the two strokes only takes one stroke <ref>Taylor, D. (1996). Introduction to marine engineering (2nd ed., rev. ed.). Oxford ; Boston: Butterworth Heinemann.</ref>. Another key difference between the two would be that a two stoke engine does not use an intake valve, instead it has a [[Scavenging (engine)|scavenging port]] <ref>Brady, Robert N, (1996). Modern diesel technology, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice Hall</ref>. The more common one of the two would have to be a four-stroke engine due to its better fuel efficiency across a wider range of rpm. One advantage of a two stoke engine is that it is considered simpler due to the fact that it has fewer moving parts, this also allows the two-stroke engine to be smaller and more compact <ref>Russell, P., Jackson, L., & Morton, T. (2018). General engineering knowledge for marine engineers (6th ed., Reeds marine engineering and technology; 8). London ; New York: Reeds.</ref>.\n\n=== Ocean Liners ===\nOcean Liners were the result of the steam engine and new innovations in ship propulsion using propellers. They are passenger vessels designed to transport people by water from one location to the other in a fairly short amount of time. In 1840, [[Samuel Cunard]] began operating ocean liners in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and around [[Great Britain]]. Eventually, [[Cunard Line|Cunard Lines]] grew to be one of the biggest leaders of the industry along with various U.S. and French ships. While Ocean liners are no longer in demand due to the use of [[Airplane|airplanes]], in the mid-19th century they were the most prestigious way to travel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/ocean-liner|title=Ocean liner {{!}} ship|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Cruise Ships ===\nCruise ships took their place after ocean liners began to fade from the industry due to less demand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://porteconomicsmanagement.org/?page_id=1386|title=Chapter 7.1 \u2013 Cruise Ports|date=2020-02-03|website=Port Economics, Management and Policy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> These ocean liners were repurposed as cruise ships offering amenities, food, and trips to various ports of call. Many cruise lines were founded towards the end of the 1960s and into the early 1970s and had their engineers completely transform ships to better fit the cruising industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncl.com/about|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=Norwegian Cruise Line|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.carnival.com/about-carnival/about-us.aspx|title=About Us|last=Line|first=Carnival Cruise|website=Carnival Cruise Line|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Ever since then, cruise lines and their engineers are aiming to have the most innovative fleet of ships and continue to transform the industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalcaribbean.com/aboutus|title=Executives Biography {{!}} Royal Caribbean International|website=www.royalcaribbean.com|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Cargo Ships ===\n[[File:Jeremiah o'brien.jpg|thumb|133x133px|One of two liberty ships that are still operational]]\nUnlike the engineers of ocean liners, cargo vessels transformed from [[Steam engine|steam]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]] much earlier on as they provided more power and [[propulsion]] necessary for moving the large loads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/ship|title=Ship - Cargo ships|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> These kinds of vessels carry very large loads onboard to transport all over the world.\n\n===Offshore oil rigs===\nMarine engineers work on more than [[marine engines]]. Marine engineers are also responsible for building and maintaining [[Oil platform|offshore oil rigs]]. These oil rigs were first made by Henry L. Williams in 1896.<ref>Bruce A. Wells, (2003) Offshore Petroleum History, American Oil and Gas Historical Society. Retrieved 4/10/14 http://aoghs.org/offshore-exploration/offshore-oil-history/</ref>\n\n==Marine engineering specialties==\n\n===Naval architect===\n\n[[Naval architecture|Naval architects]] are concerned with the overall design of the ship and its propulsion through the water. This is the first step in the overall design of the ship and creates the guidelines that will lead to the actual construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webb.edu/about-webb-institute/what-is-a-naval-architect/|title=What is Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering?|website=Webb Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanical engineering===\n\nMechanical engineers design the main [[propulsion]] plant, the powering and mechanization aspects of the ship functions such as steering, [[anchor]]ing, [[cargo#Marine|cargo]] handling, heating, ventilation, air conditioning interior and exterior communication, and other related requirements.  [[Electrical power generation]] and [[electrical power distribution]] systems are typically designed by their suppliers; only installation is the design responsibility of the marine engineer.\n\n===Oceanographic engineering===\nOceanographic engineering is concerned with mechanical, electrical, and electronic, and computing technology deployed to support [[oceanography]], and also falls under the umbrella of marine engineering, especially in Britain, where it is covered by the same professional organisation, the [[IMarEST]].\n\n===Offshore engineering===\n\nCivil engineering for an offshore environment, the design and construction of fixed and floating marine structures, such as [[oil platform]]s and [[offshore wind farm]]s is generally called ''offshore engineering''.\n\n==Challenges specific to marine engineering==\n===Hydrodynamic loading===\nIn the same way that civil engineers design to accommodate wind loads on building and bridges, maritime engineers design to accommodate a ship being flexed or a platform being struck by waves millions of times in its life.\n\n===Stability===\nA naval architect, like an airplane designer, is concerned with [[Ship stability|stability]].  The naval architect's job is different, insofar as a ship operates in two fluids simultaneously: water and air. Engineers also face the challenge of balancing cargo as the mass of the ship increase and the center of gravity shifts higher as additional containers are stacked vertically. In addition, the weight of fuel presents a problem as the pitch of the ship cause the weight to shift with the liquid causing an imbalance. This offset is counteracted by water inside larger [[ballast]] tanks. Engineers are faced with the task of balancing and tracking the fuel and ballast water of a ship.\n\n===Corrosion===\nThe chemical environment faced by ships and offshore structures is far harsher than nearly anywhere on land, save chemical plants.  Marine engineers are concerned with surface protection and preventing [[galvanic corrosion]] in every project. \u00a0 [[Corrosion]] can be inhibited through [[cathodic protection]] by utilizing pieces of metal known as sacrificial anodes. A piece of metal such as zinc is used as the sacrificial anode as it becomes the anode in the chemical reaction. This causes the metal to corrode and not the ship\u2019s hull. Another way to prevent corrosion is by sending a controlled amount of low DC current to the ship\u2019s hull to prevent the process of electro-chemical corrosion. This changes the electrical charge of the ship\u2019s hull to prevent electro-chemical corrosion.\n\n=== Anti-fouling ===\nAnti-fouling is the process of eliminating obstructive organisms from essential components of seawater systems. Marine organisms grow and attach to the surfaces of the outboard suction inlets used to obtain water for cooling systems. [[Electrochlorination|Electro-chlorination]] involves running high electrical current through sea water. The combination of current and sea water alters the chemical composition to create [[sodium hypochlorite]] to purge any bio-matter.  An electrolytic method of anti-fowling involves running electrical current through two anodes (Scardino, 2009).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Fouling control using air bubble curtains: protection for stationary vessel.|journal = Journal of Marine Engineering & Technology|volume = 8|pages = 3\u201310|last=Scardino|date=2009|doi = 10.1080/20464177.2009.11020214|doi-access = free}}</ref> These anodes typically consist of copper and aluminum (or iron). The copper [[anode]] releases its ion into the water creating an environment that is too toxic for bio-matter. The second metal, aluminum, coats the inside of the pipes to help prevent corrosion. Other forms of marine growth such as mussels and algae may attach themselves to the bottom of a ship's hull. This causes the ship to have a less hydrodynamic shape since it would not be uniform and smooth around the hull. This creates the problem of less fuel efficiency as it slows down the vessel (IMO, 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Anti-foulingSystems/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Anti-Fouling Systems|date=2018|website=International Maritime Organization}}</ref> This issue can be remedied by using special paint that prevent the growth of such organisms.\n\n=== Pollution control ===\n\n==== Sulfur emission ====\n\nThe burning of marine fuels has the potential to release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Ships burn marine diesel in addition to [[heavy fuel oil]]. Heavy fuel oil, being the heaviest of [[Refined oil products|refined oils]], releases [[sulfur dioxide]] when burned. [[Sulfur dioxide emissions]] have the potential to raise atmospheric and [[ocean acidity]] causing harm to marine life. However, heavy fuel oil may only be burned in [[international waters]] due to the pollution created. It is commercially advantageous due to the cost effectiveness compared to other marine fuels. It is prospected that heavy fuel oil will be phased out of commercial use by the year 2020 (Smith, 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritimepropulsion.com|title=Eco Ships:The New Norm for Top Tier Ships|last=Smith|date=2018|website=Maritime Reporter and Engineering News}}</ref>\n\n==== Oil and water discharge ====\n\nWater, oil, and other substances collect at the bottom of the ship in what is known as the bilge. Bilge water is pumped overboard, but must pass a pollution threshold test of 15 ppm (parts per million) of oil to be discharged. Water is tested and either discharged if clean or recirculated to a holding tank to be separated before being tested again. The tank it is sent back to, the oily water separator, utilizes gravity to separate the fluids due to their viscosity. Ships over 400 gross tons  are required to carry the equipment to separate oil from bilge water. Further, as enforced by MARPOL, all ships over 400 gross tons and all oil tankers over 150 gross tons are require to log all oil transfer is an oil record book (EPA, 2011).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/vgp_bilge.pdf|title=Oily Bilgewater Separators|date=2011|website=Environmental Protection Agency Office of Wastewater Management United States}}</ref>\n\n=== Cavitation ===\n[[Cavitation]] is the process of forming an air bubble in a liquid due to the vaporization of that liquid cause by an area of low pressure. This area of low pressure lowers the boiling point of a liquid allowing it to vaporize into a gas. Cavitation can take place in pumps, which can cause damage to the impeller that moves the fluids through the system. Cavitation is also seen in propulsion. Low pressure pockets form on the surface of the propeller blades as its revolutions per minute increase (IIMS, 2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iims.org.uk/introduction-propeller-cavitation/|title=An Introduction to Propeller Cavitation|date=2015|website=International Institute of Maritime Surveying}}</ref> Cavitation on the propeller causes a small but violent implosion which could warp the propeller blade. To remedy the issue, more blades allow the same amount of propulsion force but at a lower rate of revolutions. This is crucial for submarines as the propeller needs to keep the vessel relatively quiet to stay hidden. With more propeller blades, the vessel is able to achieve the same amount of propulsion force at lower shaft revolutions.\n\n==== Prevention ====\nCavitation occurs when a change in pressure is found in a liquid which will cause the liquid to turn into a vapor <ref>Brady, Robert N, (1996). Modern diesel technology, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice Hall</ref>. This can be found on propellers and pumps that are pumping liquids. Cavitation will lead to premature erosion of the propeller and on the impeller of a [[centrifugal pump]]. One of the reasons that cavitation is so dangerous is that if this occurs in a fuel line there is a good chance that it could explode. One way to prevent this in a fuel system is to use [[Pump|positive displacement pumps]] instead of centrifugal pumps. When it comes to preventing cavitation on a propeller you can do two things, slow down the speed of the propeller or increase the number of props <ref>\u2022\tRussell, P., Jackson, L., & Morton, T.

Prior to his political career, Largent was a [[wide receiver]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[National Football League]] for his entire 14-season [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] career. He held several all-time receiving records when he retired.\n\n==Football career==\n[[File:NFL-Week02-SeaVSF001.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Banners of Largent and the [[12th man (football)|12th Man]] hang over [[CenturyLink Field]].]]\n\nIn 1974 at the [[University of Tulsa]], Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdown catches.\n\nDespite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was not selected until the fourth round of the [[1976 NFL Draft]] by the [[Houston Oilers]] (117th pick). After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut, but was instead traded to the expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a 1977 eighth-round pick. According to Largent, [[Bum Phillips]] called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8gVg9bdUU</ref>\n\nLargent spent 14 years with the Seahawks, initially reuniting with his college offensive coordinator, [[Jerry Rhome]]. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he suffered from sleep deprivation for 9 days while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Largent: A Football Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnjxRe5uyI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> While not particularly fast, was extremely sure-handed and was able to get wide open due to his route-running discipline. He became the first Seahawk selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. \n\n\nIn 1987, Largent ended his participation in the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[work stoppage|strike]] after the third and final week of the strike. With the retirement of [[Charlie Joiner]] the previous year, Largent became the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner's all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in Week 3 of 1988.

Boren|David Boren]]. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor [[David Walters]] designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe's term in the [[103rd Congress]] before beginning his term in the [[104th Congress]].<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000096 LARGENT, Steve, (1954\u2013 )]. bioguide.congress.gov</ref><ref>Jim Myers, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&articleid=485047&archive=yes \"Largent Takes Oath of Office\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 1994.</ref>\n\nLargent took office on November 29, 1994 and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican [[Tulsa]]-based district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312190526/http://www.ok.gov/~elections/96gsum.html \"Oklahoma State Election Board\"].

Largent was one of the \"true believers\" in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christians]].\n\nOne of his first bills was a \"parental rights\" bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995\u20131996|1995 federal government shutdown]] and played a role in the failed attempt to oust [[Newt Gingrich]] as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C.\n\nHe was accused of being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives [[chaplain]] in 2000, though he denied this.<ref>David van Biema, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39948,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Catholic Bashing?], ''[[TIME]]'', February 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot.<ref>Guy Gugliotta and Juliet Eilperin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/house111998.htm House Republicans Embrace Livingston, Armey, Watts]. [[Washington Post]], November 19, 1998.</ref>  However, when [[Bob Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.\n\n====Run for Governor====\nLargent decided to run for [[Governor of Oklahoma]] in [[Oklahoma gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator [[Brad Henry]], Largent lost to Henry by just under 7,000 votes.\n\nLargent's loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:\n* The presence of a well-funded independent ([[Gary Richardson (lawyer)|Gary Richardson]], a former Republican) on the general election ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\">David Averill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=215&articleid=20090322_215_G6_GaryRi652763 \"Eyeing another campaign: Richardson had impact on 2002 governor's race\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 22, 2009.</ref>\n* Henry's support of [[cockfighting]], garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\" /><ref name=\"AP20021106\">[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/2002-11-06-oklahoma-gov_x.htm \"Henry upsets Steve Largent in governor's race\"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[USA Today]]'', November 5, 2002.</ref><ref>John M.

Prior to his political career, Largent was a [[wide receiver]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[National Football League]] for his entire 14-season [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] career. He held several all-time receiving records when he retired.\n\n==Football career==\n[[File:NFL-Week02-SeaVSF001.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Banners of Largent and the [[12th man (football)|12th Man]] hang over [[CenturyLink Field]].]]\n\nIn 1974 at the [[University of Tulsa]], Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdown catches.\n\nDespite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was not selected until the fourth round of the [[1976 NFL Draft]] by the [[Houston Oilers]] (117th pick). After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut, but was instead traded to the expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a 1977 eighth-round pick. According to Largent, [[Bum Phillips]] called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8gVg9bdUU</ref>\n\nLargent spent 14 years with the Seahawks, initially reuniting with his college offensive coordinator, [[Jerry Rhome]]. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he suffered from sleep deprivation for 9 days while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Largent: A Football Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnjxRe5uyI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> While not particularly fast, was extremely sure-handed and was able to get wide open due to his route-running discipline. He became the first Seahawk selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. \n\n\nIn 1987, Largent ended his participation in the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[work stoppage|strike]] after the third and final week of the strike. With the retirement of [[Charlie Joiner]] the previous year, Largent became the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner's all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in Week 3 of 1988. In the same season, he suffered a concussion and lost two teeth when he was hit by [[Mike Harden]] of  [[Denver Broncos]]. Harden was tackled by Largent and lost a fumble 14 weeks later after Harden's initial interception.\n\nIn 1989, Largent became the first Seahawks player to win the [[Steve Largent Award]] for his spirit, dedication, and integrity.<ref>Booth, Tim (December 19, 2008).

In 1999, he was ranked number 46 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only Seahawk to make the list.\n\nHis #80 was [[jersey retirement|retired]] in 1992; Largent is the first Seahawk player to be so honored. During [[Jerry Rice]]'s stint with the Seahawks in 2004, Largent's #80 was temporarily \"unretired\" after a conversation between Rice and Largent that was reportedly initiated by then Seahawks president [[Bob Whitsitt]].<ref>Greg Bishop, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2002076120_rice29.html \"Hawks offered No. 80, Rice says\"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.</ref> Largent remains the most prolific receiver in team history.

Boren|David Boren]]. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor [[David Walters]] designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe's term in the [[103rd Congress]] before beginning his term in the [[104th Congress]].<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000096 LARGENT, Steve, (1954\u2013 )]. bioguide.congress.gov</ref><ref>Jim Myers, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&articleid=485047&archive=yes \"Largent Takes Oath of Office\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 1994.</ref>\n\nLargent took office on November 29, 1994 and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican [[Tulsa]]-based district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312190526/http://www.ok.gov/~elections/96gsum.html \"Oklahoma State Election Board\"].

Largent was one of the \"true believers\" in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christians]].\n\nOne of his first bills was a \"parental rights\" bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995\u20131996|1995 federal government shutdown]] and played a role in the failed attempt to oust [[Newt Gingrich]] as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C.\n\nHe was accused of being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives [[chaplain]] in 2000, though he denied this.<ref>David van Biema, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39948,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Catholic Bashing?], ''[[TIME]]'', February 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot.<ref>Guy Gugliotta and Juliet Eilperin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/house111998.htm House Republicans Embrace Livingston, Armey, Watts]. [[Washington Post]], November 19, 1998.</ref>  However, when [[Bob Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.\n\n====Run for Governor====\nLargent decided to run for [[Governor of Oklahoma]] in [[Oklahoma gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator [[Brad Henry]], Largent lost to Henry by just under 7,000 votes.\n\nLargent's loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:\n* The presence of a well-funded independent ([[Gary Richardson]], a former Republican) on the general election ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\">David Averill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=215&articleid=20090322_215_G6_GaryRi652763 \"Eyeing another campaign: Richardson had impact on 2002 governor's race\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 22, 2009.</ref>\n* Henry's support of [[cockfighting]], garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\" /><ref name=\"AP20021106\">[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/2002-11-06-oklahoma-gov_x.htm \"Henry upsets Steve Largent in governor's race\"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[USA Today]]'', November 5, 2002.</ref><ref>John M.

The two races are fighting over Professor Honeycutt, who has the plans for a teleportation device that both sides seek for their war efforts against each other. The Turtles end up on the Triceraton home world, and after saving Honeycutt, are teleported back to Earth by the Utroms. The aliens reveal themselves to be benevolent and reunite the Turtles with [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], who they had healed after their last confrontation with the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], who survived the battle as well. His attack is foiled when the Utroms are able to teleport to their home planet with Honeycutt, and his true nature as an Utrom criminal named Ch'rell is revealed before he is defeated once again.\n\nIn the wake of the Shredder's defeat, a gang war erupts over control of his lost territory by the remainder of the [[Foot Clan]], the Purple Dragons (led by Hun), and the New York mafia (aided by [[Baxter Stockman]]). [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] argue over their place in fighting in the war, but the Turtles end up aiding [[Karai (character)|Karai]], the Shredder's adopted daughter, in claiming control of the New York Foot Clan and restoring order to the city. Though they part with a friendly ceasefire, the Shredder is revealed to have survived yet again, and Karai's loyalty to her father conflicting with her honor becomes a critical dilemma for her for the remainder of the series.\n\nIn the season finale, the Turtles follow Splinter to the Battle Nexus, a kingdom where a tournament is held between the multiverse's greatest warriors by the Ultimate Daimyo. The Turtles meet new allies in the form of [[Miyamoto Usagi]] and [[Murakami Gennosuke]], and end up working to defeat an attempted coup on the Daimyo's life by his own son and Drako, Splinter's old foe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]]: the leader of the Turtles who seeks an alliance with Karai.

The two races are fighting over Professor Honeycutt, who has the plans for a teleportation device that both sides seek for their war efforts against each other. The Turtles end up on the Triceraton home world, and after saving Honeycutt, are teleported back to Earth by the Utroms. The aliens reveal themselves to be benevolent and reunite the Turtles with [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], who they had healed after their last confrontation with the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], who survived the battle as well. His attack is foiled when the Utroms are able to teleport to their home planet with Honeycutt, and his true nature as an Utrom criminal named Ch'rell is revealed before he is defeated once again.\n\nIn the wake of the Shredder's defeat, a gang war erupts over control of his lost territory by the remainder of the [[Foot Clan]], the Purple Dragons (led by Hun), and the New York mafia (aided by [[Baxter Stockman]]). [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] argue over their place in fighting in the war, but the Turtles end up aiding [[Karai (character)|Karai]], the Shredder's adopted daughter, in claiming control of the New York Foot Clan and restoring order to the city. Though they part with a friendly ceasefire, the Shredder is revealed to have survived yet again, and Karai's loyalty to her father conflicting with her honor becomes a critical dilemma for her for the remainder of the series.\n\nIn the season finale, the Turtles follow Splinter to the Battle Nexus, a kingdom where a tournament is held between the multiverse's greatest warriors by the Ultimate Daimyo. The Turtles meet new allies in the form of [[Miyamoto Usagi]] and [[Murakami Gennosuke]], and end up working to defeat an attempted coup on the Daimyo's life by his own son and Drako, Splinter's old foe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]]: the leader of the Turtles who seeks an alliance with Karai.
