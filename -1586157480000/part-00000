The WLM branch of [[radical feminism]], based in [[contemporary philosophy]], comprised women of racially- and culturally-diverse backgrounds who proposed that economic, psychological, and social freedom were necessary for women to progress from being second-class citizens in their societies.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=314}}\n\nTowards achieving the equality of women, the WLM questioned the cultural and legal validity of [[patriarchy]] and the practical validity of the social and sexual [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society. Women's liberationists proposed that [[sexism]]\u2014legalized formal and informal sex-based discrimination predicated on the existence of the social construction of gender\u2014was the principal political problem with the power dynamics of their societies. In general, the WLM proposed socio-economic change from the [[Left-wing politics|political Left]], rejected the idea that piecemeal equality, within and according to [[social class]], would eliminate sexual discrimination against women, and fostered the tenets of [[humanism]], especially the respect for [[human rights]] of all people. In the decades during which the Women's Liberation Movement flourished, liberationists successfully changed how women were perceived in their cultures, redefined the socio-economic and the political roles of women in society, and transformed mainstream society.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=315}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Social cycle theory|wave theory of social development]] holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=762}} After the intense period fighting for [[women's suffrage]], the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the [[African National Congress Women's League]],{{sfn|Walker|1991|p=83}} the [[Irish Housewives Association]],{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=109}} the [[League of Women Voters]], the [[Townswomen's Guild]]s and the [[Women's Institutes]] supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|pp=763\u2013764}}{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=5}} Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the work force during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=764}} The [[World YWCA]] and [[Zonta International]], were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=175}}{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American [[National Women's Party]], were marginalized, by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as \"severe neurotics responsible for the problems of\" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=765}}\n\nIn countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South America efforts to decolonize and replace authoritarian regimes, which largely began in the 1950s and stretched through the 1980s, initially saw the state overtaking the role of radical feminists. For example, in Egypt, the 1956 Constitution eliminated gender barriers to labour, political access, and education through provisions for gender equality.{{sfn|Al-Ali|2002|p=8}} Women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua and other [[Latin America]]n countries had worked for an end to dictatorships in their countries. As those governments turned to socialist policies, the state aimed to eliminate gender inequality through state action.{{sfn|Russell|2012|p=19}} As ideology in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean shifted left, women in newly independent and still colonized countries saw a common goal in fighting imperialism. They focused their efforts to address gendered power imbalances in their quest for respect of human rights and nationalist goals.{{sfn|Armstrong|2016|p=305}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|Neptune|2011}} This worldwide movement towards decolonization and the realignment of international politics into [[Cold War]] camps after the end of World War II, usurped the drive for women's enfranchisement, as universal suffrage and nationhood became the goal for activists.{{sfn|Rubio-Mar\u00edn|2014}} A Pan-African awareness and global recognition of blackness as a unifying point for struggle, led to a recognition by numerous marginalized groups that there was potential to politicize their oppression.{{sfn|Bagneris|2011|p=4}}\n\nIn their attempt to influence these newly independent countries to align with the United States, in the polarized Cold War climate, [[racism]] in U.S. policy became a stumbling block to the foreign policy objective to become the dominant [[superpower]]. Black leaders were aware of the favorable climate for securing change and pushed forward the [[Civil Rights Movement]] to address racial inequalities.{{sfn|Morris|1999|pp=522\u2013524}} They sought to eliminate the damage of oppression, using [[Liberation psychology|liberation theory]] and a movement which sought to create societal transformation in the way people thought about others by infusing the disenfranchised with political power to change the power structures.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=1}} The [[Black Power movement]] and global student movements protested the apparent double standards of the age and the authoritarian nature of social institutions.{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=44\u201345, 50}} From [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Mexico 68|Mexico]], in diverse locations like Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, among others, students protested the civil, economic and political inequalities, as well as involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=48\u201350}} Many of the activists participating in these causes would go on to participate in the feminist movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=4}}\n\nSocially, the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] experienced after Second World War, the relative worldwide economic growth in the post-war years, the expansion of the television industry sparking improved communications, as well as access to higher education for both women and men led to an awareness of the social problems women faced and the need for a cultural change.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=16}} At the time, women were economically dependent on men and neither the concept of [[patriarchy]] nor a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society existed.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|pp=391\u2013392}} If they worked, positions available to women were typically in light manufacturing or agricultural work and a limited segment of positions in the service industries, such as bookkeeping, domestic labor, nursing, secretarial and clerical work, retail sales, or school teaching.{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218\u2013219}} They were expected to work for lower wages than men and upon marriage, terminate their employment.{{sfn|Mioko|1978|p=77}}{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218\u2013219}} Women were unable to obtain bank accounts or credit, making renting housing impossible, without a man's consent. In many countries they were not allowed to go into public spaces without a male chaperone.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=6}}\n\nMarried women from countries founded the British colonial system and thus with a legal code based on English law were legally bound to have sex with their husbands upon demand. Marital rape was not a concept, as under law women had given consent to regular intercourse upon marrying.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=2}} The state and church, placed enormous pressure on young women to retain their virginity. Introduction of the pill, gave many men a sense that as women could not get pregnant, they could not say no to intercourse.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=3}} Though by the 1960s the pill was widely available, prescription was tightly controlled and in many countries, dissemination of information about birth control was illegal.{{sfn|Nilsson|Spencer|2015}} Even after the pill was legalized, contraception remained banned in numerous countries, like Ireland where condoms were banned and the pill could only be prescribed to control menstrual cycles.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=46}} The Catholic Church issued the encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' in 1968, reiterating the ban on [[Birth control|artificial contraception]].{{sfn |Rengel|2000|p=202}} Abortion often required the consent of a spouse,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=241}} or approval by a board, like in Canada, wherein the decisions often revolved around whether pregnancy posed a threat to the woman's health or life.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=469\u2013470}}\n\nAs women became more educated and joined the work force, their home responsibilities remained largely unchanged. Though families increasingly depended on dual incomes, women carried most of the responsibility for domestic work and care of children.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|pp=37\u201338}} There had long been recognition by society in general of the inequalities in civil, socio-economic, and political agency between women and men. However, the Women's Liberation Movement was the first time that the idea of challenging [[sexism]] gained wide acceptance.{{sfn|Bucy|2010|p=306}} Literature on sex, such as the [[Kinsey Reports]], and the development and distribution of the [[birth control pill]], created a climate wherein women began to question the authority others wielded over their decisions regarding their bodies and their morality.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=17}} Many of the women who participated in the movement, were aligned with leftist politics and after 1960, with the development of Cold War polarization, took their inspiration from [[Maoist theory]]. Slogans such as \"workers of the world unite\" turned into \"women of the world unite\" and key features like consciousness-raising and egalitarian consensus-based policies \"were inspired by similar techniques used in China\".{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=136-137}}\n\nInto this backdrop of world events, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] published ''[[The Second Sex]]'' in 1949, which was translated into English in 1952. In the book, de Beauvoir put forward the idea that equality did not require women be masculine to become empowered.{{sfn|Bergoffen|2004}} With her famous statement, \"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\", she laid the groundwork for the concept of [[gender]] as a social construct, as opposed to a biological trait.{{sfn|Butler|1986|p=35}} The same year, [[Margaret Mead]] published ''[[Male and Female (book)|Male and Female]]'', which though it analyzed primitive societies of New Guinea, showed that gendered activities varied between cultures and that biology had no role in defining which tasks were performed by men or women. By 1965, de Beauvoir and Mead's works had been translated into Danish and became widely influential with feminists.{{sfn|Larsen|2014}}{{sfn|Tobias|1997}}  [[Kurahashi Yumiko]] published her debut ''Partei'' in 1960, which critically examined the student movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=13}} The work started a trend in Japan of feminist works which challenged the opportunities available to women and mocked conventional power dynamics in Japanese society.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|pp=50\u201351}} In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', voicing the discontent felt by American women.{{sfn|Fox|2006}}\n\n== Aims ==\nAs the [[women's suffrage]] movement emerged from the [[Abolitionism|abolition movement]], the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|''The Dayton Daily News''|1969|p=11}} Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of [[second-wave feminism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=344\u2013345}} Rather than simply desiring legal equality, those participating in the movement believed that the moral and social climate which perceived women as second-class citizens needed to change. Though most groups operated independently\u2014there were no national umbrella organizations\u2014there were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate in both public and private spheres, liberationists believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|''The Dayton Daily News''|1969|p=11}}{{sfn|Studer|2017|p=15-16}}\n\nOne of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced.{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, eliminating objectification of women, ethnic empowerment, granting women reproductive rights, increasing opportunities for women in the workplace, peace, and redefining familial roles, as well as gay and [[lesbian]] liberation.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}} A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}\n\nWomen's historical participation in the world was virtually unknown, even to trained historians.{{sfn|Myrbr\u00e5ten|2013|p=20-21}}{{sfn|DuBois|1998|p=10}} Women's roles in historic events were not covered in academic texts and not taught in schools.

They made changes in their lives to address their individual needs and social arrangements, but were unwilling to take action on issues that might threaten their socio-economic status.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=107}} Liberationist theory also failed to recognize a fundamental difference in fighting oppression. Combating sexism had an internal component, whereby one could change the basic power structures within family units and personal spheres to eliminate the inequality. Class struggle and the fight against racism are solely external challenges, requiring public action to eradicate inequality.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=110}}\n\nThere was criticism of the movement not only from factions within the movement itself,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} but from outsiders, like [[Hugh Hefner]], ''[[Playboy]]'' founder, who launched a campaign to expose all the \"highly irrational, emotional, kookie trends\" of feminism in an effort to tear apart feminist ideas that were \"unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society\" promoted by his magazine.{{sfn|Dow|2014|p=120}} \"Women's libbers\" were widely characterized as \"man-haters\" who viewed men as enemies, advocated for [[separatist feminism|all-women societies]], and encouraged women to leave their families behind.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Semanticist Nat Kolodney argued that while women were oppressed by social structures and rarely served in tyrannical roles over the male population as a whole, men in general were not oppressors of women either. Instead, social constructs and the difficulty of removing systems which had long served their purpose exploited both men and women.{{sfn|Kolodney|1978|p=300}} Women's liberationists acknowledged that patriarchy affects both men and women, with the former receiving many privileges from it, but focused on the impact of systemic sexism and misogyny on women throughout the world.\n\nTo many women activists in the [[American Indian Movement]], black Civil Rights Movement, [[Chicano Movement#Chicanas in the movement|Chicana Movement]], as well as Asians and other minorities, the activities of the primarily white, middle-class women in the Women's Liberation Movement were focused specifically on sex-based violence and the social construction of gender as a tool of sex-based oppression. By evaluating all economic, socio-cultural, and political issues through the lens of sexism without pairing it with racism and classism, liberationists often poorly represented [[women of color]] in their analyses.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=337}}{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Longeaux y V\u00e1squez|1997|p=31}} While women of color recognized that sexism was an issue, some did not see how it could be separated from the issue of race or class, which compounds to impact their access to education, health care, housing, jobs, legal justice, and the poverty and violence which permeates their lives.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=341\u2013342}}{{sfn|Longeaux y V\u00e1squez|1997|pp=30\u201331}} For women who did not speak English, or spoke it as a second language, sexism had little to do with the ability to protect herself or utilize existing systems.{{sfn|Castillo|1997|p=46}} The focus on personal freedom was another divergence between white women and women of color. Some did not see the intrinsic connection between the liberation of women and the liberation of men that was advocated for by the Women's Liberation Movement and felt that feminists did not care about the inequalities suffered by men; they felt that the liberation of women without the liberation of men from policies that keep men of color from obtaining jobs and limit their civil rights, further preventing them from being able to protect their families, neither improved humanity as a whole nor improved the plight experienced by families.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}{{sfn|Longeaux y V\u00e1squez|1997|p=31}} [[Dorothy Height]], president of the [[National Council of Negro Women]], expressed that the best way black women could help themselves was to help their men gain equality.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}\n\nRegarding the \"sex-positive\" sect that broke away from the women's liberation movement, extending personal freedom to sexual freedom, the meaning of being free to have relations with whoever one wanted, was lost on black women who had been sexually assaulted and raped with impunity for centuries{{sfn|Sklar|2015}} or Native Women who were routinely sterilized.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=339}} Their issues were not about limiting their families but having the freedom to form families.{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=349}} It had very little meaning in the traditional Chicana culture wherein women were required to be virgins until marriage and remain na\u00efve in her marriage.{{sfn|Anonymous|1997|p=83}} Though invited to participate within the Women's Liberation Movement, many women of color cautioned against the single focus on sexism, finding it to be an incomplete analysis without the consideration of racism.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=342}} Likewise, though many lesbians saw commonalities with Women's Liberation through the goals of eponymous liberation from sex-based oppression, which included fighting against homophobia, others believed that the focus was too narrow to confront the issues they faced.{{sfn|Klemesrud|1970}} Differences in the understanding of gender and how it relates to and informs sex-based oppression and systemic sexism called attention to differences in issues. For example, many liberationists rejected the performance of femininity as a positive behavior, which meant that white lesbians who actively chose to perform femininity had to decide between their desire to be feminine-presenting and their rejection of sexual objectification. Jackie Anderson, an activist and philosopher, observed that in the black lesbian community being able to dress up made them feel confident because during the work week, black women had to conform to dress codes imposed upon them.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=55}} This was and continues to be a sentiment held by most women, who tend to believe that the feeling of confidence derived from performing femininity as dictated by the sexist status quo is the same as empowerment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rottenberg|first1=Catherine|title=The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism|journal=[[Cultural Studies

The WLM branch of [[radical feminism]], based in [[contemporary philosophy]], comprised women of racially- and culturally-diverse backgrounds who proposed that economic, psychological, and social freedom were necessary for women to progress from being second-class citizens in their societies.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=314}}\n\nTowards achieving the equality of women, the WLM questioned the cultural and legal validity of [[patriarchy]] and the practical validity of the social and sexual [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society. Women's liberationists proposed that [[sexism]]\u2014legalized formal and informal sex-based discrimination predicated on the existence of the social construction of gender\u2014was the principal political problem with the power dynamics of their societies. In general, the WLM proposed socio-economic change from the [[Left-wing politics|political Left]], rejected the idea that piecemeal equality, within and according to [[social class]], would eliminate sexual discrimination against women, and fostered the tenets of [[humanism]], especially the respect for [[human rights]] of all people. In the decades during which the Women's Liberation Movement flourished, liberationists successfully changed how women were perceived in their cultures, redefined the socio-economic and the political roles of women in society, and transformed mainstream society.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=315}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Social cycle theory|wave theory of social development]] holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=762}} After the intense period fighting for [[women's suffrage]], the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the [[African National Congress Women's League]],{{sfn|Walker|1991|p=83}} the [[Irish Housewives Association]],{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=109}} the [[League of Women Voters]], the [[Townswomen's Guild]]s and the [[Women's Institutes]] supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|pp=763\u2013764}}{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=5}} Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the work force during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=764}} The [[World YWCA]] and [[Zonta International]], were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=175}}{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American [[National Women's Party]], were marginalized, by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as \"severe neurotics responsible for the problems of\" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=765}}\n\nIn countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South America efforts to decolonize and replace authoritarian regimes, which largely began in the 1950s and stretched through the 1980s, initially saw the state overtaking the role of radical feminists. For example, in Egypt, the 1956 Constitution eliminated gender barriers to labour, political access, and education through provisions for gender equality.{{sfn|Al-Ali|2002|p=8}} Women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua and other [[Latin America]]n countries had worked for an end to dictatorships in their countries. As those governments turned to socialist policies, the state aimed to eliminate gender inequality through state action.{{sfn|Russell|2012|p=19}} As ideology in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean shifted left, women in newly independent and still colonized countries saw a common goal in fighting imperialism. They focused their efforts to address gendered power imbalances in their quest for respect of human rights and nationalist goals.{{sfn|Armstrong|2016|p=305}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|Neptune|2011}} This worldwide movement towards decolonization and the realignment of international politics into [[Cold War]] camps after the end of World War II, usurped the drive for women's enfranchisement, as universal suffrage and nationhood became the goal for activists.{{sfn|Rubio-Mar\u00edn|2014}} A Pan-African awareness and global recognition of blackness as a unifying point for struggle, led to a recognition by numerous marginalized groups that there was potential to politicize their oppression.{{sfn|Bagneris|2011|p=4}}\n\nIn their attempt to influence these newly independent countries to align with the United States, in the polarized Cold War climate, [[racism]] in U.S. policy became a stumbling block to the foreign policy objective to become the dominant [[superpower]]. Black leaders were aware of the favorable climate for securing change and pushed forward the [[Civil Rights Movement]] to address racial inequalities.{{sfn|Morris|1999|pp=522\u2013524}} They sought to eliminate the damage of oppression, using [[Liberation psychology|liberation theory]] and a movement which sought to create societal transformation in the way people thought about others by infusing the disenfranchised with political power to change the power structures.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=1}} The [[Black Power movement]] and global student movements protested the apparent double standards of the age and the authoritarian nature of social institutions.{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=44\u201345, 50}} From [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Mexico 68|Mexico]], in diverse locations like Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, among others, students protested the civil, economic and political inequalities, as well as involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=48\u201350}} Many of the activists participating in these causes would go on to participate in the feminist movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=4}}\n\nSocially, the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] experienced after Second World War, the relative worldwide economic growth in the post-war years, the expansion of the television industry sparking improved communications, as well as access to higher education for both women and men led to an awareness of the social problems women faced and the need for a cultural change.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=16}} At the time, women were economically dependent on men and neither the concept of [[patriarchy]] nor a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society existed.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|pp=391\u2013392}} If they worked, positions available to women were typically in light manufacturing or agricultural work and a limited segment of positions in the service industries, such as bookkeeping, domestic labor, nursing, secretarial and clerical work, retail sales, or school teaching.{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218\u2013219}} They were expected to work for lower wages than men and upon marriage, terminate their employment.{{sfn|Mioko|1978|p=77}}{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218\u2013219}} Women were unable to obtain bank accounts or credit, making renting housing impossible, without a man's consent. In many countries they were not allowed to go into public spaces without a male chaperone.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=6}}\n\nMarried women from countries founded the British colonial system and thus with a legal code based on English law were legally bound to have sex with their husbands upon demand. Marital rape was not a concept, as under law women had given consent to regular intercourse upon marrying.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=2}} The state and church, placed enormous pressure on young women to retain their virginity. Introduction of the pill, gave many men a sense that as women could not get pregnant, they could not say no to intercourse.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=3}} Though by the 1960s the pill was widely available, prescription was tightly controlled and in many countries, dissemination of information about birth control was illegal.{{sfn|Nilsson|Spencer|2015}} Even after the pill was legalized, contraception remained banned in numerous countries, like Ireland where condoms were banned and the pill could only be prescribed to control menstrual cycles.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=46}} The Catholic Church issued the encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' in 1968, reiterating the ban on [[Birth control|artificial contraception]].{{sfn |Rengel|2000|p=202}} Abortion often required the consent of a spouse,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=241}} or approval by a board, like in Canada, wherein the decisions often revolved around whether pregnancy posed a threat to the woman's health or life.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=469\u2013470}}\n\nAs women became more educated and joined the work force, their home responsibilities remained largely unchanged. Though families increasingly depended on dual incomes, women carried most of the responsibility for domestic work and care of children.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|pp=37\u201338}} There had long been recognition by society in general of the inequalities in civil, socio-economic, and political agency between women and men. However, the Women's Liberation Movement was the first time that the idea of challenging [[sexism]] gained wide acceptance.{{sfn|Bucy|2010|p=306}} Literature on sex, such as the [[Kinsey Reports]], and the development and distribution of the [[birth control pill]], created a climate wherein women began to question the authority others wielded over their decisions regarding their bodies and their morality.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=17}} Many of the women who participated in the movement, were aligned with leftist politics and after 1960, with the development of Cold War polarization, took their inspiration from [[Maoist theory]].

Having lived in a communal housing project or been affiliated with youth movements made liberationists targets and their meeting places were searched and materials were confiscated.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1970-77 Fear and Terror}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Women's Liberation Movement created a global awareness of patriarchy and sexism.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91\u201392}}{{sfn|Walker|1991|pp=xxii\u2013xxiii}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|''The Winnipeg Free Press''|1989|p=35}} By bringing matters that had long been considered private issues into the public view and linking those issues to deepen understanding about how systemic suppression of women's rights in society are interrelated, liberationists made innovative contributions to feminist theory.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=179-180}} Desiring to know about women's historic contributions but often being thwarted in their search due to centuries of censoring and blocking of women's intellectual work, liberationists brought the study of power relationships, including those of sex and diversity, into the social sciences. They launched women's studies programs and publishing houses to ensure that a more culturally comprehensive history of the complex nature of society was developed.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}}{{sfn|Lee|2014}}\n\nIn an effort to distance themselves from the politics and ideas of women in the Liberation Movement, as well as the personal politics which emerged, many [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] distanced themselves from the early movement. [[Meaghan Morris]], an Australian scholar of popular culture stated that later feminists could not associate themselves with the ideas and politics of the period and maintain their respect.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=5}} And yet, liberationists succeeded in pushing the dominant liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims and forced them to include goals that address sexual discrimination.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91\u201392}} [[Jean Curthoys]] argued that in the rush to distance themselves from liberationists, an unconscious amnesia rewrote the history of their movement,{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=6}} and failed to grasp the achievement that, without a religious connotation, the movement created an \"ethic of the irreducible value of human beings.\"{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=7}} Phrases that were used in the movement, like \"consciousness raising\" and \"male chauvinism,\" became keywords associated with the movement.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=4}}{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}\n\n=== Influential publications ===\n* {{cite book|last1=Barreno|first1=Maria Isabel|last2=Horta|first2=Maria Teresa|last3=Velho da Costa|first3=Maria|editor-last1=Land|editor-first1=Helen R.

They made changes in their lives to address their individual needs and social arrangements, but were unwilling to take action on issues that might threaten their socio-economic status.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=107}} Liberationist theory also failed to recognize a fundamental difference in fighting oppression. Combating sexism had an internal component, whereby one could change the basic power structures within family units and personal spheres to eliminate the inequality. Class struggle and the fight against racism are solely external challenges, requiring public action to eradicate inequality.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=110}}\n\nThere was criticism of the movement not only from factions within the movement itself,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} but from outsiders, like [[Hugh Hefner]], ''[[Playboy]]'' founder, who launched a campaign to expose all the \"highly irrational, emotional, kookie trends\" of feminism in an effort to tear apart feminist ideas that were \"unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society\" promoted by his magazine.{{sfn|Dow|2014|p=120}} \"Women's libbers\" were widely characterized as \"man-haters\" who viewed men as enemies, advocated for [[separatist feminism|all-women societies]], and encouraged women to leave their families behind.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Semanticist Nat Kolodney argued that while women were oppressed by social structures and rarely served in tyrannical roles over the male population as a whole, men in general were not oppressors of women either. Instead, social constructs and the difficulty of removing systems which had long served their purpose exploited both men and women.{{sfn|Kolodney|1978|p=300}} Women's liberationists acknowledged that patriarchy affects both men and women, with the former receiving many privileges from it, but focused on the impact of systemic sexism and misogyny on women throughout the world.\n\nTo many women activists in the [[American Indian Movement]], black Civil Rights Movement, [[Chicano Movement#Chicanas in the movement|Chicana Movement]], as well as Asians and other minorities, the activities of the primarily white, middle-class women in the Women's Liberation Movement were focused specifically on sex-based violence and the social construction of gender as a tool of sex-based oppression. By evaluating all economic, socio-cultural, and political issues through the lens of sexism without pairing it with racism and classism, liberationists often poorly represented [[women of color]] in their analyses.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=337}}{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Longeaux y V\u00e1squez|1997|p=31}} While women of color recognized that sexism was an issue, some did not see how it could be separated from the issue of race or class, which compounds to impact their access to education, health care, housing, jobs, legal justice, and the poverty and violence which permeates their lives.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=341\u2013342}}{{sfn|Longeaux y V\u00e1squez|1997|pp=30\u201331}} For women who did not speak English, or spoke it as a second language, sexism had little to do with the ability to protect herself or utilize existing systems.{{sfn|Castillo|1997|p=46}} The focus on personal freedom was another divergence between white women and women of color. Some did not see the intrinsic connection between the liberation of women and the liberation of men that was advocated for by the Women's Liberation Movement and felt that feminists did not care about the inequalities suffered by men; they felt that the liberation of women without the liberation of men from policies that keep men of color from obtaining jobs and limit their civil rights, further preventing them from being able to protect their families, neither improved humanity as a whole nor improved the plight experienced by families.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}{{sfn|Longeaux y V\u00e1squez|1997|p=31}} [[Dorothy Height]], president of the [[National Council of Negro Women]], expressed that the best way black women could help themselves was to help their men gain equality.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}\n\nRegarding the \"sex-positive\" sect that broke away from the women's liberation movement, extending personal freedom to sexual freedom, the meaning of being free to have relations with whoever one wanted, was lost on black women who had been sexually assaulted and raped with impunity for centuries{{sfn|Sklar|2015}} or Native Women who were routinely sterilized.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=339}} Their issues were not about limiting their families but having the freedom to form families.{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=349}} It had very little meaning in the traditional Chicana culture wherein women were required to be virgins until marriage and remain na\u00efve in her marriage.{{sfn|Anonymous|1997|p=83}} Though invited to participate within the Women's Liberation Movement, many women of color cautioned against the single focus on sexism, finding it to be an incomplete analysis without the consideration of racism.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=342}} Likewise, though many lesbians saw commonalities with Women's Liberation through the goals of eponymous liberation from sex-based oppression, which included fighting against homophobia, others believed that the focus was too narrow to confront the issues they faced.{{sfn|Klemesrud|1970}} Differences in the understanding of gender and how it relates to and informs sex-based oppression and systemic sexism called attention to differences in issues. For example, many liberationists rejected the performance of femininity as a positive behavior, which meant that white lesbians who actively chose to perform femininity had to decide between their desire to be feminine-presenting and their rejection of sexual objectification. Jackie Anderson, an activist and philosopher, observed that in the black lesbian community being able to dress up made them feel confident because during the work week, black women had to conform to dress codes imposed upon them.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=55}} This was and continues to be a sentiment held by most women, who tend to believe that the feeling of confidence derived from performing femininity as dictated by the sexist status quo is the same as empowerment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rottenberg|first1=Catherine|title=The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism|journal=[[Cultural Studies

It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]]. \nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from [[Aungban|Aungpan]] to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s  and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point.   Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town.  The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020.

But he has not been without his critics, particularly amongst rival literary schools (including other advocates of \u201cPeople\u2019s literature\u201d), which have accused him of writing in an overly stylized and unrealistic, even abstract, manner.\n\nNot just a leading literary figure but also a famous peace activist who has made a significant contribution to both internal and international peace efforts, [[Dagon Taya]] has also been subjected to political persecution. After the military staged [[1962 Burmese coup d'\u00e9tat| a coup]] in 1962, led by General [[Ne Win]], he was arrested and imprisoned by the [[Revolutionary Council]] in the [[Insein Prison]] for three years and three months on suspicion of being a communist.\n\nPersonally, [[Dagon Taya]] is known to be calm, reserved and flexible, but also firm in his convictions. He was a close friend of Burma\u2019s independence hero, [[Aung San]], who in 1943 offered him a high-ranking position in the Japanese occupation government\u2014an offer that [[Dagon]] Taya refused. Before [[Aung San]]\u2019s assassination in 1947, [[Dagon Taya]] wrote a very beautiful but highly critical essay about [[Aung San]]\u2019s personality, titled \u201c[[Aung San]] the Untamed\u201d\n\nMany [[Burmese]] were shocked by this apparent criticism of their revered father of independence, but [[Dagon Taya]], and [[Aung San]] himself, merely smiled in response to the storm of controversy that this essay generated when it first appeared in Taya magazine. Even more daring was [[Dagon Taya]]\u2019s rejection of an honor bestowed upon veterans of the independence movement by General [[Ne Win]]\u2019s socialist regime.\n\nThe State Honorary Award, which carried a grant and a monthly stipend, was generally regarded as a bribe to win the loyalty of famous patriots. After his refusal to accept the award, [[Dagon Taya]] went into self-imposed exile from the capital and composed one of his best-known poems, \u201cSending myself to the Mae Za.\u201d\n\n[[File:\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c.jpg|thumb|right|  \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c ]]\n\n\"He then came to be seen as the [[Boris Pasternak]] of [[Burma]] in the eyes of the authorities,\u201d recounts a young poet and close associate of [[Dagon Taya]] now living in exile. \u201cMae Za, in the Burmese political context, means the place where opponents of the king used to be sent as exiles, something like the [[gulags]] of [[Soviet Russia]].\u201d\n\nDespite his strong leftist sympathies, [[Dagon Taya]] felt no need to conform to preconceived notions of socialist orthodoxy, either intellectually or in his lifestyle. He eschewed any sycophancy towards self-declared \u201cliberators\u201d of the masses, and throughout his life, kept his distance from political parties. A lifelong bachelor with long, wavy hair and custom of wearing iridescent silk longyis and colorful Indonesian batik shirts, this \u201cfriend of the common man\u201d also loved to express his free-spirited nature through painting and by playing the piano in a completely improvised, unrestrained manner.<ref>https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/the-living-history-dagon-taya-modern-burmese-literature.html</ref>\n\n\n\n\n \n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of [[Yangon]]'s [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|right|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Aunpan's 100th year Anniversary ==\n\n2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town. The locals celebrated the town's 100th anniversary with many celebrations. The town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower was also built at the [[Pindaya]] junction. The tower was removed in 2019 due to the upgrading of the  [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] four-lane road and to be rebuilt in the same place by the construction company.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| native_name = {{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}\n| official_name = Aungpan\n|pushpin_map = Burma\n|pushpin_map_caption = Location in Burma\n|image_skyline = Aungban.jpg\n|image_map = \n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Shan State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Burma|Districts]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Taunggyi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Kalaw Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 = \n|population = \n|population_as_of = 2014\n\n|population_blank1            = [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Danu people|Danu]], [[Bamar]], [[Pa-O]], [[Taungyo]], [[Burmese Chinese]], [[Burmese Indians]], [[Burmese Gurkha|Gurkha]]\n|population_blank1_title     = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Theravada Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_total = 30,313\n\n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Myanmar#Asia\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location of Aungpan, Myanmar\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|20|40|0|N|96|38|0|E|type:town_region:MM|display=inline,title}}\n\n\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|established_date = 1913\n|established_title = Founded\n|elevation_ft = 4219\n|elevation_m =  1286\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset               = +6.30\n|area_code                = 081 <ref>{{Cite web| url=http://en.18dao.net/Area_Code/Myanmar | title=Myanmar Area Codes | accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> \n|postal_code_type         = [[Postal code]] [http://www.myanmaposts.net.mm/]\n|postal_code              = 06022\n|registration_plate       = SHN\n| blank_name_sec1 = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank_info_sec1 = [[Humid subtropical]] (Cwa)\n|website                  =\n}}\n\n'''Aungpan''' ({{lang-my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town located in the Southern [[Shan State]]. It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]]. \nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from [[Aungban|Aungpan]] to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s  and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point.   Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town.  The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS [https://www.mohs.gov.mm/]|.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look. \nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''), closely bordering a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'') according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\n\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate.

Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military Hospital\n* Gayunar Yike Nyein Clinic ({{my|\u1000\u101b\u102f\u100f\u102c\u101b\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1004\u103c\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1006\u1031\u1038\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038}})\n\n==Notable people==\n===Dagon Taya (\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c)===\n\n[[File:\u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038 \u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c.jpg|Smallpx|thumb|left|\u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038 \u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c]]\n\n[[Dagon Taya]], a renowned [[Myanmar]] writer and a [[Manhae Prize|Manhae Peace Prize]] winner passed away at the age of 95 at Aungpan in the afternoon of August 19th, 2013 local time 1:15. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.myanmarcelebrity.com/2013/08/the-last-day-of-prominent-author-dagon.html |title=The Last Day of Prominent Author Dagon Taryar ~ Myanmar Celebrity: All about Myanmar Celebrities |publisher=Info.myanmarcelebrity.com |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205546/http://info.myanmarcelebrity.com/2013/08/the-last-day-of-prominent-author-dagon.html |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nHis monument can be seen on the Maeko Mountain (\u1019\u101a\u103a\u1001\u102d\u102f\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a) of Aungpan surrounded by beautiful pine trees.\n\nThe influence of [[Dagon Taya]]\u2019s literary movement has, amazingly, continued to the present day. But he has not been without his critics, particularly amongst rival literary schools (including other advocates of \u201cPeople\u2019s literature\u201d), which have accused him of writing in an overly stylized and unrealistic, even abstract, manner.\n\nNot just a leading literary figure but also a famous peace activist who has made a significant contribution to both internal and international peace efforts, [[Dagon Taya]] has also been subjected to political persecution. After the military staged [[1962 Burmese coup d'\u00e9tat| a coup]] in 1962, led by General [[Ne Win]], he was arrested and imprisoned by the [[Revolutionary Council]] in the [[Insein Prison]] for three years and three months on suspicion of being a communist.\n\nPersonally, [[Dagon Taya]] is known to be calm, reserved and flexible, but also firm in his convictions. He was a close friend of [[Burma]]\u2019s independence hero, [[Aung San]], who in 1943 offered him a high-ranking position in the Japanese occupation government\u2014an offer that [[Dagon]] Taya refused. Before [[Aung San]]\u2019s assassination in 1947, [[Dagon Taya]] wrote a very beautiful but highly critical essay about [[Aung San]]\u2019s personality, titled \u201c[[Aung San]] the Untamed\u201d\n\nMany [[Burmese]] were shocked by this apparent criticism of their revered father of independence, but [[Dagon Taya]], and [[Aung San]] himself, merely smiled in response to the storm of controversy that this essay generated when it first appeared in Taya magazine. Even more daring was [[Dagon Taya]]\u2019s rejection of an honor bestowed upon veterans of the independence movement by General [[Ne Win]]\u2019s socialist regime.\n\nThe State Honorary Award, which carried a grant and a monthly stipend, was generally regarded as a bribe to win the loyalty of famous patriots. After his refusal to accept the award, [[Dagon Taya]] went into self-imposed exile from the capital and composed one of his best-known poems, \u201cSending myself to the Mae Za.\u201d\n\n[[File:\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c.jpg|thumb|right|  \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c ]]\n\n\"He then came to be seen as the [[Boris Pasternak]] of [[Burma]] in the eyes of the authorities,\u201d recounts a young poet and close associate of [[Dagon Taya]] now living in exile. \u201cMae Za, in the Burmese political context, means the place where opponents of the king used to be sent as exiles, something like the [[gulags]] of [[Soviet Russia]].\u201d\n\nDespite his strong [[Left-wing politics|leftist sympathies]], [[Dagon Taya]] felt no need to conform to preconceived notions of socialist orthodoxy, either intellectually or in his lifestyle. He eschewed any sycophancy towards self-declared \u201cliberators\u201d of the masses, and throughout his life, kept his distance from political parties. A lifelong bachelor with long, wavy hair and custom of wearing iridescent silk [[longyi|longyis]] and colorful Indonesian [[batik]] shirts, this \u201cfriend of the common man\u201d also loved to express his free-spirited nature through painting and by playing the piano in a completely improvised, unrestrained manner.<ref>https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/the-living-history-dagon-taya-modern-burmese-literature.html</ref>\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of [[Yangon]]'s [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|right|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Aunpan's 100th year Anniversary ==\n\n2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town. The locals celebrated the town's 100th anniversary with many celebrations. The town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower was also built at the [[Pindaya]] junction. The tower was removed in 2019 due to the upgrading of the  [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] four-lane road and to be rebuilt in the same place by the construction company.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "name_user": "Kmthu.ytu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotable people", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aungban"}
