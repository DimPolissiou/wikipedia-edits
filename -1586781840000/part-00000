The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\nParagraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:\n{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}\n\nLater, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL \u2013 UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\n==== U.N. map of ceasefire line ====\nTitle of [[U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2 which illustrates the CFL as per the Karachi Agreement reads:\n\n<blockquote>Map of the State of Jammu and Kashmir showing the Cease Fire Line as Agreed Upon in the Karachi Agreement, Ratified by the Governments of India and Pakistan on 29 and 30 July Respectively.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.<ref>SANGAKU 71</ref>\n\nIn 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]...

Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some estimates, 97% of the casualties in Siachen have been due to weather and altitude, rather than actual fighting.<ref name=\"Jack\">{{cite book\n  |last = Ives\n  |first = Jack\n  |title = Himalayan Perceptions: Environmental Change and the Well-Being of Mountain Peoples\n  |publisher = Routledge, 2004\n  |isbn = 9781134369089|date = 5 August 2004\n }}</ref> In 2012, an avalanche [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|hit Pakistan's Gayari military base, killing 129 soldiers and 11 civilians]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| publisher=Bbc.co.uk| title=Pakistan declares Siachen avalanche buried dead| date=29 May 2012| access-date=21 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| archive-date=18 January 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|title=Siachen: Pakistan declares buried troops dead after 52 days \u2013 Hindustan Times|publisher=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=7 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011175924/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Kargil War==\nOne of the factors behind the [[Kargil War]] in 1999 when Pakistan sent infiltrators to occupy vacated Indian posts across the [[Line of Control]] was their belief that India would be forced to withdraw from Siachen in exchange of a Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil.<ref name=\"India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vZKO2XtiFMC |title=India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |last2=Kapur |first2=S.

The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H.

The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army.

Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200 million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some estimates, 97% of the casualties in Siachen have been due to weather and altitude, rather than actual fighting.<ref name=\"Jack\">{{cite book\n  |last = Ives\n  |first = Jack\n  |title = Himalayan Perceptions: Environmental Change and the Well-Being of Mountain Peoples\n  |publisher = Routledge, 2004\n  |isbn = 9781134369089|date = 5 August 2004\n }}</ref> In 2012, an avalanche [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|hit Pakistan's Gayari military base, killing 129 soldiers and 11 civilians]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| publisher=Bbc.co.uk| title=Pakistan declares Siachen avalanche buried dead| date=29 May 2012| access-date=21 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| archive-date=18 January 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|title=Siachen: Pakistan declares buried troops dead after 52 days \u2013 Hindustan Times|publisher=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=7 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011175924/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Kargil War==\nOne of the factors behind the [[Kargil War]] in 1999 when Pakistan sent infiltrators to occupy vacated Indian posts across the [[Line of Control]] was their belief that India would be forced to withdraw from Siachen in exchange of a Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil.<ref name=\"India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vZKO2XtiFMC |title=India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |last2=Kapur |first2=S.

The playwright [[Ranchhodbhai Dave]], who had previously worked with Natak Uttejak Mandali (1875\u201394), helped in the starting and management of the new troupe, which initially started as an amateur group of Gujarati teachers.  On 5 June 1878, three partners, Jayshankar Sarveshvar, Narottam Bhaichand, and Shivshankar Karasanji, co-founded the company, which later became known as Mehtajis' theatre company. Later they were joined by Manekram Dhirajram, Damodar Ratansi Somani, and Lalji Karsanji as new partners. The partners were responsible for various departments of the company.  Sarveshvar was the manager and director of the company. The company pioneered the pure Gujarati culture-influenced theatre, free from any Parsi influences.<ref name=\"ox2\">{{cite book|last=Bhojak|first=Dinkar J.|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0201#|title=The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195644463|editor-last=Lal|editor-first=Ananda|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001|via=Oxford Reference}}</ref>{{snf|Choksi|2004|pp=11-12}}\n\nThe company first produced ''Lalita Dukhdarshak'' (Lalita's Manifold Sufferings), a reformist play written and directed by Dave.

It gave immense contributions to the [[Gujarati theatre]], with productions of more than hundred plays, as well as the training and introducing of many major actors and directors.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Gujarati Natak Mandali (1878\u201389) ===\nGujarati theatre was established on the foundation of the Gujarati Natak Mandali. It was founded in response to discontent with the [[Parsi theatre]] company owner Framji Gustadji Dalal. The playwright [[Ranchhodbhai Dave]], who had previously worked with Natak Uttejak Mandali (1875\u201394), helped in the starting and management of the new troupe, which initially started as an amateur group of Gujarati teachers.  On 5 June 1878, three partners, Jayshankar Sarveshvar, Narottam Bhaichand, and Shivshankar Karasanji, co-founded the company, which later became known as Mehtajis' theatre company. Later they were joined by Manekram Dhirajram, Damodar Ratansi Somani, and Lalji Karsanji as new partners. The partners were responsible for various departments of the company.  Sarveshvar was the manager and director of the company. The company pioneered the pure Gujarati culture-influenced theatre, free from any Parsi influences.<ref name=\"ox2\">{{cite book|last=Bhojak|first=Dinkar J.|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001/acref-9780195644463-e-0201#|title=The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195644463|editor-last=Lal|editor-first=Ananda|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195644463.001.0001|via=Oxford Reference}}</ref>{{snf|Choksi|2004|pp=11-12}}\n\nThe company first produced ''Lalita Dukhdarshak'' (Lalita's Manifold Sufferings), a reformist play written and directed by Dave. It premiered on 6 January 1878 at the Victoria Theatre in front of an audience of 1200 people. It was the first social tragedy in the Gujarati language, with five acts and thirty-four scenes. It had twenty characters, including the character of Nandan, whose name became synonymous with a fool.<ref name=\"ox2\" />\n\nDave wrote and directed the second play, ''Nal Damayanti'' (Nala and Damayanti), which also became successful. Other plays, ''Harishchandra'', ''Madalsa ane Ritudhvaj'' (Madalsa and Ritudhvaj), and ''Banasur Madmardan'' (Taming of Banasur's Arrogance) were also produced by the company.<ref name=\"ox2\" />\n\nChhotalal Mulchand Kapadia of [[Khambhat]] bought the Gujarati Natak Mandali with two other partners.

The trains were manufactured at the [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works]].\n\nThe propulsion for the trains was manufactured by a consortium of [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] and [[Brush Traction]],<ref name=\"tp-wa\">{{cite web|title=A-Series EMU Car Review, Paper tabled to WA Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3912874cc5fc39f2e6de87f348257e440005910a/$file/tp-2874.pdf|website=Parliament of Western Australia|access-date=17 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424133417/http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3912874cc5fc39f2e6de87f348257e440005910a/$file/tp-2874.pdf|archive-date=24 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was one of the first examples of microprocessor-controlled traction featuring a fibre-optic network to connect the different control units. The DC traction motors of LT130 type have separately-excited fields and are controlled via [[GTO (Thyristor)|GTO]] (Gate turn-off) thyristors.<ref name=\"tp-wa\" />\n\nA Wheel Slide Protection (WSP) system was retrofitted due to the fleet suffering an epidemic problem of wheel flats. This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe 1992 stock's design is reminiscent of the 1986 prototypes. The new [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 stock]] trains, built by Bombardier Transport for the [[Victoria line]], are more like the 1992 stock in shape and design than the [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995]]/[[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996]] stock.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Waterloo & City line sets ===\n[[File:Bank station Waterloo & City line train.JPG|thumb|Waterloo & City line train at Bank]]\nAfter the initial construction run, an additional ten two-car units were built for [[British Rail]] for the [[Waterloo & City line]], which at the time was part of the national railway network. The trains were designated as [[British Rail Class 482|Class 482]] until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to [[London Underground]].<ref name=TFL/> The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.\n\n[[Transport for London]] and [[Metronet]] closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line's limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press both \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until mid-2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank. Change for Northern, District and Circle lines, Docklands Light Railway and Network SouthEast services. \u2026 This train terminates at Hainault via Newbury Park.\" (The [[Waterloo & City line]] was part of [[Network SouthEast]] at the time of the stock's introduction and the original recordings were never revised to reflect the takeover of the line by [[London Underground]] in 1994.){{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n*''Approaching {{LUL stations|station=Notting Hill Gate}}:''\n*:\"The next station is Notting Hill Gate. Change for District and Circle lines.\"\n\nSince mid-2003, voice artist [[Emma Clarke]] has provided recordings for the 1992 Stock DVA, which were again revised in 2006. Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.

Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.

The new announcements are no longer voiced by Emma Clarke.\n\n==Chancery Lane derailment==\nOn 25 January 2003 a 1992 Stock train with approximately 500 people on board train derailed as it entered [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane station]] on the westbound line. The collision resulted in one door being ripped off and a number of broken windows. 32 passengers received minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Final report |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |publisher=RAIB |accessdate=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209124951/https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090325194353/http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/incident-chancerylane-final.pdf |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe cause of the derailment was determined to be the detachment of the rearmost [[traction motor]] on the fifth car, caused by a gearbox failure. The traction motor was then struck by the remainder of the train as it passed over it, causing the following [[bogies]] to derail.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703040611/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |archive-date=3 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nThe entire 1992 Stock fleet was withdrawn from service the same afternoon, and the Central and Waterloo & City lines were closed for several weeks until modifications were made. This included fitting new traction-motor bolts and secondary brackets in to prevent a loose motor from striking the track and causing further damage. The lines re-opened in stages from 14 March 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703040611/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#Chancery |archive-date=3 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Refurbishment ==\n=== Central line units ===\nThe 1992 Stock has had a refresh of both the interior and exterior. Some of the noticeable changes include a new seat moquette, improved lighting and improvements to the window frames. The front of the driving cabs are also being renewed. This includes repairing water ingress and replacing a large number of parts with a much simpler design, saving costs on future work. The new-style front end can be easily identified by the red panelling instead of the original grey. The refresh comes after nearly twenty years of continuous service on the Central line.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} \n\n=== Waterloo & City line units ===\n[[File:65507 at Bank LUL station.jpg|thumb|A Waterloo & City line 1992 Stock in its original Network SouthEast livery. All trains on the line were repainted into the standard London Underground livery in 2006|alt=]]\nIn 2006, the Waterloo & City line was closed for several months to allow for track and signalling upgrade works.

The trains were manufactured at the [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works]].\n\nThe propulsion for the trains was manufactured by a consortium of [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] and [[Brush Traction]],<ref name=\"tp-wa\">{{cite web|title=A-Series EMU Car Review, Paper tabled to WA Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3912874cc5fc39f2e6de87f348257e440005910a/$file/tp-2874.pdf|website=Parliament of Western Australia|access-date=17 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424133417/http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/publications/tabledpapers.nsf/displaypaper/3912874cc5fc39f2e6de87f348257e440005910a/$file/tp-2874.pdf|archive-date=24 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was one of the first examples of microprocessor-controlled traction featuring a fibre-optic network to connect the different control units.

This was largely due to an excessive number of emergency brake applications caused during the ATO/ATP testing phases.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe 1992 stock's design is reminiscent of the 1986 prototypes. The new [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 stock]] trains, built by Bombardier Transport for the [[Victoria line]], are more like the 1992 stock in shape and design than the [[London Underground 1995 Stock|1995]]/[[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996]] stock.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Waterloo & City line sets ===\n[[File:Bank station Waterloo & City line train.JPG|thumb|Waterloo & City line train at Bank]]\nAfter the initial construction run, an additional ten two-car units were built for [[British Rail]] for the [[Waterloo & City line]], which at the time was part of the national railway network. The trains were designated as [[British Rail Class 482|Class 482]] until 1 April 1994, when the operation of the line and the trains were transferred to [[London Underground]].<ref name=TFL/> The vehicles are essentially identical to those used on the Central line; the main difference being that trip-cocks are used for protection instead of ATO/ATP.\n\n[[Transport for London]] and [[Metronet]] closed the Waterloo & City line for five months from April to September 2006 to allow major upgrade work on the tunnels and rolling stock. The line's limited access meant that this was the first time that the units had been brought above ground since their introduction 12 years earlier. The refurbishment of the trains saw them painted in the London Underground white, red and blue livery in place of the [[Network SouthEast]] colours used since the stock's introduction.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe 1992 stock features both ATO (Automatic Train Operation) and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) which effectively allow the trains to drive themselves. The ATO is responsible for operating the train whilst the ATP detects electronic codes in the track and feeds them to the cab, displaying the target speed limits. This functionality is configured via a switch in the driver's cab which can be set to one of three positions: Automatic, Coded Manual and Restricted Manual.\n\nIn ''Automatic'' mode the ATO and ATP are both fully operational. The driver is only required to open and close the doors and press both \"Start\" buttons when the train is ready to depart. The driver is then tasked with overseeing the operation of the system and can intervene at any time. The ATO controls the train to the desired target speed, whilst the ATP is ready to apply the emergency brakes if the Maximum Safe Speed is exceeded.\n\nIn ''Coded Manual'' mode, the ATO is disabled and the driver operates the train manually, however, the ATP is still detecting the codes in the track and restricting the driver's actions. The [[speedometer]] on 1992 stock is of the horizontal strip design showing two speeds: the Current Speed in green, indicating the speed at which the train is actually travelling, and the Target Speed indicating the speed at which the train should be travelling. Although the target speed is always active whilst running in Automatic or Coded Manual mode, in the latter mode a change in the target speed is indicated with an upwards or downwards tone depending on whether the target speed is increasing or decreasing. Should the driver exceed the target speed, an alarm sounds and the emergency brakes are automatically applied until the train is below the target speed; the alarm then stops.\n\nIn ''Restricted Manual'' mode, the train cannot exceed {{convert|18|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the motors automatically cut out at {{convert|16|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The ATO and ATP are both disabled and the driver operates the train entirely by sight and according to the signals. This mode is used when there has been an ATP or signal failure, or in a depot where ATP is not used, e.g. West Ruislip and Hainault depots. On the main line, driving in ATO is the same for a train driver as driving through a section where signals have failed.\n\n== Announcer system ==\n{{Summarize section|date=November 2019}}\nThe 1992 Stock was the first of its type on the Underground to have a DVA (Digital Voice Announcer) from new. Until mid-2003, the DVA was voiced by then BBC journalist and presenter Janet Mayo, subsequently nicknamed 'Sonia', as some drivers thought the repetitiveness of the announcements 'gets on ya nerves'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|title=1992 tube stock: Sonia|accessdate=2014-07-13|work=SQUAREWHEELS.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014044448/http://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1992tubeStock/#sonia|archive-date=14 October 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe original format of the announcements were as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after an article by the ''Daily Mail'' was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she \"hated the tube,\" when in actual fact, she just said that she would not like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7113545.stm</ref>\n\nThe present format of the announcements is as follows:\n\n*''{{LUL stations|station=Bank}}, going eastbound to {{LUL stations|station=Hainault}} via {{LUL stations|station=Newbury Park}}:''\n*:\"This is Bank.

The June\u2013July issue of ''Sciences Humaines'' included Damasio in its list of 50 key thinkers in the human sciences of the past two centuries.\n\nDamasio also proposed that emotions are part of [[Homeostasis|homeostatic regulation]] and are rooted in reward/punishment mechanisms.  He recovered [[William James|William James']] perspective on feelings as a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an \"as-if-body-loop\" device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation process later uncovered by [[mirror neurons]]).  He demonstrated experimentally that the [[insular cortex]] is a critical platform for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and he uncovered [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and [[wikt:subcortical|subcortical]] induction sites for human emotions, e.g. in [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and [[amygdala]].<ref>Damasio AR, Grabowski TJ, Bechara A, Damasio H, Ponto LLB, Parvizi J, Hichwa RD. Subcortical and cortical brain activity during the feeling of self-generated emotions\" ''Nature Neuroscience'' 3:1049\u20131056. 2000</ref> He also demonstrated that while the insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Damasio A, Damasio H, Tranel D | year = 2012 | title = Persistence of feelings and sentience after bilateral damage of the insula | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  23| issue = 4| pages =  833\u201346| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs077 | pmid=22473895 | pmc=3657385}}</ref>\n\nHe has continued to investigate the neural basis of feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Damasio A, Damasio H, Tranel D | year = 2012 | title = Persistence of feelings and sentience after bilateral damage of the insula | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  23| issue = 4| pages =  833\u201346| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs077 | pmid=22473895 | pmc=3657385}}</ref> He regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How people learn : designing effective training to improve employee performance|last=Shackleton-Jones, Nick|isbn=9780749484712|location=London, United Kingdom|oclc=1098213554|date = 2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nIn another development, Damasio proposed that the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of [[axon|axonal projections]] that converge on certain nodes out of which projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence (the [[convergence-divergence zone]]s).  This architecture is applicable to the understanding of [[memory]] processes and of aspects of consciousness related to the access of mental contents.<ref>Damasio AR. Time-locked multiregional retroactivation: a systems level proposal for the neural substrates of recall and recognition\" ''Cognition'' 33:25\u201362. 1989</ref>\n\nIn ''The Feeling of What Happens'', Damasio laid the foundations of the \"enchainment of precedences\": \"the nonconscious [[neural]] [[Signal transduction|signaling]] of an individual organism begets the [[protoself]] which permits [[core self]] and [[core consciousness]], which allow for an [[autobiographical self]], which permits [[extended consciousness]].

The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the [[entorhinal cortex]] of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<ref>Hyman B, Van Hoesen GW, Damasio A, Barnes C.

His 1994 book, ''[[Descartes' Error]]: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain'', won the [[Science et Vie]] prize, was a finalist for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Book Award, and is translated in over 30 languages.  It is regarded as one of the most influential books of the past two decades.<ref>In January 2010, Sciences Humaines named it one of the 20 books that changed the vision of the world. The book has been cited over 13,000 times</ref> His second book, ''The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness'', was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', a ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' Best Book of the Year, a ''[[Library Journal]]'' Best Book of the Year, and has over 30 foreign editions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Damasio's ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', was published in 2003. In it, Damasio suggested that the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s thinking foreshadowed discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mind-body problem and that Spinoza was a protobiologist.  Damasio's latest book is ''Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain''. In it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core self.  The book received the Corinne International Book Prize.<ref>{{cite web |last=Damasio |first=Ant\u00f3nio |title=Self Comes to Mind |url=http://www.corine.de/chronik/index.php |access-date=2013-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201013/http://www.corine.de/chronik/index.php |archive-date=2013-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Dam\u00e1sio no Fronteiras do Pensamento S\u00e3o Paulo 2013 (16929531365).jpg|thumb|Damasio at [[Fronteiras do Pensamento]] (Frontiers of Thought) in 2013]]\nDamasio is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the National Academy of Medicine, the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

For part of his studies, he researched [[behavioral neurology]] under the supervision of [[Norman Geschwind]] of the Aphasia Research Center in Boston.\n\nDamasio's main field is [[neurobiology]], especially the neural systems which underlie emotion, decision-making, memory, language and consciousness.  Damasio might believe that emotions play a critical role in high-level cognition\u2014an idea counter to dominant 20th-century views in psychology, neuroscience and philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n[[File:Science of Morality - World Science Festival - 92 St Y (2534904279).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Damasio in 2008.]]\n\nDamasio formulated the [[somatic marker hypothesis]],<ref>Damasio AR. \"The somatic marker hypothesis and the possible functions of the pre-frontal cortex\". ''Transactions of the Royal Society''. (London) 351:1413\u20131420. 1996.</ref> a theory about how emotions and their biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making (both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously). Emotions provide the scaffolding for the construction of [[social cognition]] and are required for the self processes which undergird consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} \"Damasio provides a contemporary scientific validation of the linkage between feelings and the body by highlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells&nbsp;... this personalized embodiment of mind.\"<ref>Lara Trout. ''The Politics of Survival'' (2010). p. 74.</ref>\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis has inspired many [[neuroscience]] experiments carried out in laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major impact in contemporary science and philosophy.<ref>[http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/arc/2/1/20.html]</ref> Damasio has been named by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] as one of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade. Current work on the biology of [[morality|moral]] decisions, [[neuro-economics]], [[social communication]], and drug-addiction, has been strongly influenced by Damasio's hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} An article published in the Archives of Scientific Psychology in 2014 named Damasio one of the 100 most eminent psychologist of the modern era. (Diener et al. ''Archives of Scientific Psychology'', 2014, 2, 20\u201332). The June\u2013July issue of ''Sciences Humaines'' included Damasio in its list of 50 key thinkers in the human sciences of the past two centuries.\n\nDamasio also proposed that emotions are part of [[Homeostasis|homeostatic regulation]] and are rooted in reward/punishment mechanisms.  He recovered [[William James|William James']] perspective on feelings as a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an \"as-if-body-loop\" device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation process later uncovered by [[mirror neurons]]).  He demonstrated experimentally that the [[insular cortex]] is a critical platform for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and he uncovered [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and [[wikt:subcortical|subcortical]] induction sites for human emotions, e.g. in [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and [[amygdala]].<ref>Damasio AR, Grabowski TJ, Bechara A, Damasio H, Ponto LLB, Parvizi J, Hichwa RD. Subcortical and cortical brain activity during the feeling of self-generated emotions\" ''Nature Neuroscience'' 3:1049\u20131056. 2000</ref> He also demonstrated that while the insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Damasio A, Damasio H, Tranel D | year = 2012 | title = Persistence of feelings and sentience after bilateral damage of the insula | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  23| issue = 4| pages =  833\u201346| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs077 | pmid=22473895 | pmc=3657385}}</ref>\n\nHe has continued to investigate the neural basis of feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Damasio A, Damasio H, Tranel D | year = 2012 | title = Persistence of feelings and sentience after bilateral damage of the insula | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  23| issue = 4| pages =  833\u201346| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs077 | pmid=22473895 | pmc=3657385}}</ref> He regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.<ref>{{Cite book|title=How people learn : designing effective training to improve employee performance|last=Shackleton-Jones, Nick|isbn=9780749484712|location=London, United Kingdom|oclc=1098213554|date = 2019-05-03}}</ref>\n\nIn another development, Damasio proposed that the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of [[axon|axonal projections]] that converge on certain nodes out of which projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence (the [[convergence-divergence zone]]s).  This architecture is applicable to the understanding of [[memory]] processes and of aspects of consciousness related to the access of mental contents.<ref>Damasio AR. Time-locked multiregional retroactivation: a systems level proposal for the neural substrates of recall and recognition\" ''Cognition'' 33:25\u201362. 1989</ref>\n\nIn ''The Feeling of What Happens'', Damasio laid the foundations of the \"enchainment of precedences\": \"the nonconscious [[neural]] [[Signal transduction|signaling]] of an individual organism begets the [[protoself]] which permits [[core self]] and [[core consciousness]], which allow for an [[autobiographical self]], which permits [[extended consciousness]].

The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the [[entorhinal cortex]] of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<ref>Hyman B, Van Hoesen GW, Damasio A, Barnes C. Alzheimer's disease: cell-specific pathology isolates the hippocampal formation\" ''Science'' 225:1168\u20131170. 1984</ref>\n\nAs a clinician, he and his collaborators have studied and treated disorders of [[behaviour]] and cognition, and [[movement disorder]]s.\n\nDamasio's books deal with the relationship between emotions and their brain substrates. His 1994 book, ''[[Descartes' Error]]: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain'', won the [[Science et Vie]] prize, was a finalist for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Book Award, and is translated in over 30 languages.  It is regarded as one of the most influential books of the past two decades.<ref>In January 2010, Sciences Humaines named it one of the 20 books that changed the vision of the world. The book has been cited over 13,000 times</ref> His second book, ''The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness'', was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'', a ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' Best Book of the Year, a ''[[Library Journal]]'' Best Book of the Year, and has over 30 foreign editions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Damasio's ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', was published in 2003. In it, Damasio suggested that the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s thinking foreshadowed discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mind-body problem and that Spinoza was a protobiologist.  Damasio's latest book is ''Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain''. In it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core self.
