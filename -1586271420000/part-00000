The election results was released in the late evening that day and the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won a total of 81 out of 83 seats as well as a tenth consecutive term in office under the then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]. Other major political parties contesting in the election were the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]], [[Singapore Democratic Party]], [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]], [[Singapore People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Singapore)|Democratic Progressive Party]].\n\nAfter nomination day on 23 December 1996, the People's Action Party returned to power for the second consecutive (and third overall) election as 47 (more than half of the total 83) seats. On polling day, voters voted for the election for the remaining 36 seats; the oppositions retained two of the four seats they won in the last election. In this election, [[Constituencies of Singapore|Group Representation Constituencies]] were increased from four members to between four and six members (six-member seats would remain present for two decades until its first absence in the [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 election]]).\n\n==Background==\nThe election would seek opportunity for Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] to score a better mandate after PAP's considerably poorer showing in the 1991 election. Two seats in PAP-held Eunos and Toa Payoh GRCs were vacated after the death of Member of Parliament (MP), Dr [[Tay Eng Soon]] and inauguration of former Deputy Prime Minister [[Ong Teng Cheong]] as Singapore's fifth and first elected President in [[1993 Singapore presidential election|1993]] respectively; however, both GRCs did not held by-elections and were instead subsumed into neighbouring GRCs. A third incumbent, Lim Chee Oon of the [[Marine Parade GRC]], retired from politics ahead of the [[1992 Marine Parade by-election|by-election in 1992]], and future Minister [[Teo Chee Hean]] succeeded Lim.\n\nIn 1993, a year following the events of the Marine Parade GRC by-election, the largest opposition party, [[Singapore Democratic Party]], faced a serious internal strife where former leader and [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency|Potong Pasir]] then-MP [[Chiam See Tong]] sued his party's Central Executive Committee (which include secretary-general [[Chee Soon Juan]] and chairman [[Ling How Doong]]) for defamation, which he won; Chiam resigned from SDP prior to nominations to lead his splinter party, [[Singapore People's Party]]. In 1994, Chee criticized then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] over a lack of democracy, which led to the attention of Organising Secretary and [[Marine Parade GRC]] member-of-parliament [[Matthias Yao]]; Chee publicly request to challenge Yao with a condition of carving out his [[MacPherson SMC|MacPherson ward]] from Marine Parade GRC into a SMC, which the latter accepted.\n\n==Timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:25%\"|16 December 1996||Dissolution of 8th Parliament\n|-\n|23 December 1996||Nomination Day\n|-\n|2 January||Polling day\n|-\n|15 January||Announcement of [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament]]\n|-\n|26 May||Opening of 9th Parliament \n|}\n\n==Nominations and campaigning==\nThe 8th Parliament was dissolved on 16 December 1996, and nominations were held exactly a week after. At the close of the nomination, 122 candidates were nominated among which PAP returned to power for the second consecutive (and third) election after a majority of seats (47) were uncontested; among which were [[Tampines GRC]], which the National Solidarity Party team was disqualified after one candidate was found to have his name struck off the electoral rolls for not voting in 1991. Chia Shi Teck became the first former Nominated MP to contest in the election as an independent candidate in an only four-cornered fight in [[Chua Chu Kang SMC]]. The Democratic Progressive Party, formerly named Singapore United Front, contested by a father-son duo led by Tan Soon Phuan and Tan Lead Shake (the latter now a member of NSP).\n\nDuring campaigning, [[Tang Liang Hong]], who was standing on the WP ticket with its secretary-general [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]] for [[Cheng San GRC]], faced criticism where Tang was accused by PAP of being an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist.\n\n==Electoral boundaries==\nNew six-member Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) were formed in the election, while six existing GRCs were absorbed into neighboring GRCs.

On 6 September 1999, the 9th Parliament was relocated to the [[Parliament House, Singapore|New Parliament House]] located within the [[Civic District]] facing [[North Bridge Road]], while the former Parliament House was closed until it reopened on 26 March 2004, in which it was renamed to [[The Arts House]].\n\n===Tang Liang Hong's self-imposed exile===\n{{main|Tang Liang Hong}}\nAfter the election, [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|WP]] candidate for [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]], [[Tang Liang Hong]] was sued for [[defamation]] by several of the PAP's leaders, including then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], then-Senior Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and then-Deputy Prime Ministers [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Tony Tan]], who accused him of making statements during the campaign which falsely questioned their integrity. A total of 13 judgements were entered against Tang for defamation.\n\nTang left Singapore shortly after the election and eventually found refuge in Australia.\n\n==External links==\n<!--Do NOT add links to blogs; it violates WP:NPOV and WP:NOT.

The election results was released in the late evening that day and the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won a total of 81 out of 83 seats as well as a tenth consecutive term in office under the then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]. Other major political parties contesting in the election were the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]], [[Singapore Democratic Party]], [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]], [[Singapore People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Singapore)|Democratic Progressive Party]].\n\nAfter nomination day on 23 December 1996, the People's Action Party returned to power with a total of 47 out of the total 83 seats and could form a government on nomination day. On polling day, voters voted for the election for their members of parliament with all but two seats going to the PAP. In this election, [[Constituencies of Singapore|Group Representation Constituencies]] were increased from four members to between four and six members. Housing issues were one of the issues raised during the election.\n\n==Background==\nThis was another opportunity for Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] to score a better mandate after PAP's considerably poorer showing in the 1991 election. Two seats in PAP-held Eunos and Toa Payoh GRCs were vacated after the death of Member of Parliament (MP), Dr [[Tay Eng Soon]] and inauguration of former Deputy PM [[Ong Teng Cheong]] as Singapore's fifth and first elected President in [[1993 Singapore presidential election|1993]] respectively; however, both GRCs did not held by-elections and were instead subsumed into neighbouring GRCs. \n\nIn 1993, a year following the events of the [[1992 Marine Parade by-election|Marine Parade GRC by-election]], the largest opposition party, [[Singapore Democratic Party]], faced a serious internal strife where former leader and [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency|Potong Pasir]] then-MP [[Chiam See Tong]] sued his party's central executive committee (which include secretary-general [[Chee Soon Juan]] and chairman [[Ling How Doong]]) for defamation, which he won; Chiam resigned from SDP prior to nominations to lead his splinter party, [[Singapore People's Party]]. In 1994, Chee criticized then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] over a lack of democracy, which led to the attention of Organising Secretary and [[Marine Parade GRC]] member-of-parliament [[Matthias Yao]]; Chee publicly request to challenge Yao with a condition of carving out his [[MacPherson SMC|MacPherson ward]] from Marine Parade GRC into a SMC, which the latter accepted.\n\n==Nominations and campaigning==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"width:25%\"|Monday 16 December 1996||Dissolution of the 8th Parliament\n|-\n|Monday 23 December 1996||Nomination Day. 122 candidates were nominated, PAP won 47 uncontested seats by walkover and was returned to government.\n|-\n|Thursday 2 January 1997||Polling day for 36 contested seats\n|-\n|Wednesday 15 January 1997||J.B.

At the close of the nomination, PAP returned to power for the second consecutive (and third) time after a majority of seats (47) were uncontested; among which were [[Tampines GRC]], which the National Solidarity Party team was disqualified after one candidate was found to have his name struck off the electoral rolls for not voting in 1991. Chia Shi Teck became the first former Nominated MP to contest in the election as an independent candidate in an only four-cornered fight in [[Chua Chu Kang SMC]]. The Democratic Progressive Party, formerly named Singapore United Front, contested by a father-son duo led by Tan Soon Phuan and Tan Lead Shake (the latter now a member of NSP).\n\nDuring campaigning, [[Tang Liang Hong]], who was standing on the WP ticket with its secretary-general [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]] for [[Cheng San GRC]], faced criticism where Tang was accused by PAP of being an anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist.\n\n==Electoral boundaries==\nSix new Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) were formed in the election, while six existing GRCs were absorbed into neighboring GRCs. Divisions of each constituencies which were either absorbed or carved out Single Member Constituencies (SMC), or creating smaller divisions, were reflected in the table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"| Constituency\n!

On 6 September 1999, the 9th Parliament was relocated to the [[Parliament House, Singapore|New Parliament House]] located within the [[Civic District]] facing [[North Bridge Road]], while the former Parliament House was closed until it reopened on 26 March 2004, in which it was renamed to [[The Arts House]].\n\n===Tang Liang Hong's self-imposed exile===\n{{main|Tang Liang Hong}}\nAfter the election, [[Workers' Party of Singapore|WP]] candidate for [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]], [[Tang Liang Hong]] was sued for [[defamation]] by several of the PAP's leaders, including then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], then-Senior Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and then-Deputy Prime Ministers [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Tony Tan]], who accused him of making statements during the campaign which falsely questioned their integrity. A total of 13 judgements were entered against Tang for defamation.\n\nTang left Singapore shortly after the election and eventually found refuge in Australia.\n\n==External links==\n<!--Do NOT add links to blogs; it violates WP:NPOV and WP:NOT.

In this context he proved [[Gromov's compactness theorem (geometry)|Gromov's compactness theorem]], stating that the set of compact [[Riemannian manifold]]s with [[Ricci curvature]] \u2265 ''c'' and [[diameter]] \u2264 ''D'' is [[relatively compact]] in the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff metric. The possible limit points of sequences of such manifolds are [[Alexandrov space]]s of curvature \u2265 ''c'', a class of [[metric space]]s studied in detail by [[Yuri Burago|Burago]], Gromov and [[Grigori Perelman|Perelman]] in 1992.  Gromov was also the first to study the space of all possible Riemannian structures on a given manifold.\n\nGromov introduced [[geometric group theory]], the study of [[infinite group]]s via the geometry of their [[Cayley graph]]s and their [[word metric]]. In 1981 he proved [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]: a [[finitely generated group]] has [[Growth rate (group theory)|polynomial growth]] (a geometric property) if and only if it is [[virtually nilpotent]] (an algebraic property). The proof uses the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff metric mentioned above. Along with [[Eliyahu Rips]] he introduced the notion of [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\nGromov founded the field of [[symplectic topology]] by introducing the theory of [[pseudoholomorphic curves]]. This led to [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]s, which are used in [[string theory]], and to his [[non-squeezing theorem]].\n\nGromov is also interested in [[mathematical biology]],<ref name=\":0\">{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201003/rtx100300391p.pdf|title=Interview with Mikhail Gromov|journal=[[Notices of the AMS]]|date=March 2010|volume=57|issue=3|pages=391\u2013403}}.</ref> the structure of the brain and the thinking process, and the way scientific ideas evolve.<ref name=\"simons\" />\n\n==Prizes and honors==\n\n===Prizes===\n*[[Prize of the Mathematical Society of Moscow]] (1971)\n*[[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]] ([[American Mathematical Society|AMS]]) (1981)\n*[[Elie Cartan Prize|Prix Elie Cartan]] de l'Academie des Sciences de Paris (1984)\n*[[Prix de l'Union des Assurances de Paris]] (1989)\n*[[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] (1993)\n*[[Leroy P.

In this context he proved [[Gromov's compactness theorem (geometry)|Gromov's compactness theorem]], stating that the set of compact [[Riemannian manifold]]s with [[Ricci curvature]] \u2265 ''c'' and [[diameter]] \u2264 ''D'' is [[relatively compact]] in the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff metric. The possible limit points of sequences of such manifolds are [[Alexandrov space]]s of curvature \u2265 ''c'', a class of [[metric space]]s studied in detail by [[Yuri Burago|Burago]], Gromov and [[Grigori Perelman|Perelman]] in 1992.  Gromov was also the first to study the space of all possible Riemannian structures on a given manifold.\n\nGromov introduced [[geometric group theory]], the study of [[infinite group]]s via the geometry of their [[Cayley graph]]s and their [[word metric]]. In 1981 he proved [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]: a [[finitely generated group]] has [[Growth rate (group theory)|polynomial growth]] (a geometric property) if and only if it is [[virtually nilpotent]] (an algebraic property). The proof uses the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff metric mentioned above. Along with [[Eliyahu Rips]] he introduced the notion of [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\nGromov founded the field of [[symplectic topology]] by introducing the theory of [[pseudoholomorphic curves]]. This led to [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]s, which are used in [[string theory]], and to his [[non-squeezing theorem]].\n\nGromov is also interested in [[mathematical biology]],<ref name=\":0\">{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201003/rtx100300391p.pdf|title=Interview with Mikhail Gromov|journal=[[Notices of the AMS]]|date=March 2010|volume=57|issue=3|pages=391\u2013403}}.</ref> the structure of the brain and the thinking process, and the way scientific ideas evolve.<ref name=\"simons\" />\n\n==Prizes and honors==\n\n===Prizes===\n*[[Prize of the Mathematical Society of Moscow]] (1971)\n*[[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]] ([[American Mathematical Society|AMS]]) (1981)\n*[[Elie Cartan Prize|Prix Elie Cartan]] de l'Academie des Sciences de Paris (1984)\n*[[Prix de l'Union des Assurances de Paris]] (1989)\n*[[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] (1993)\n*[[Leroy P.
