Until the [[French Revolution]] the parish of [[Ploudiry]] covered an area from [[Loc-Eguiner]] to Pencran, but it was in 1801 that Pencran became an independent parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petit-patrimoine.com/fiche-petit-patrimoine.php?id_pp=29156_2\n|title=Pencran Parish close|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==The porch at Pencran==\n[[File:Porche-PENCRAN.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the south porch. In the tympanum we see the Nativity scene and we can see Adam and Eve's expulsion from the Garden of Eden in the first pi\u00e9droit on the entrance's right.|alt=]]\nThis dates to 1553 and is decorated with an  angel who holds a banner inscribed{{quotation|LE 15 JOVR DE MARS L'AN 1553 FVT FONDE CESTE CHAPELLE AU NO(M)DE DIEV ET DE MADAME SAI(N)CTE APPOLINE DE PAR HERVE K(ER)JAHES ET GVILL(AVME)E BRAS FABRIQVES DE LAD.CHAPEL||title=|source=}}\n\nAccording to local records Herv\u00e9 Kerah\u00e8s and Guillaume Bras were local builders. The porch comprises an entrance arch decorated with vine leaves and bunches of grapes as well as carvings of small animals and people eating grapes and playing a trumpet. In the external voussure of the entrance arch, the carvings start on the bottom left with a lion and, after the floral decoration, ends on the right with a dragon. In the centre there is a human head, wearing a hat and nibbling at grape seeds. In the interior voussure, the sculptors repeat the same pattern but a pig replaces the dragon. A large [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is located over the arch, with a nativity scene depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] and Joseph on either side of the baby Jesus who lies on a bed of straw whilst above him the heads of a cow and a donkey protrude from the wall. This group is situated to the right hand side of the tympanum suggesting that there had been another sculpture on the left side perhaps depicting another part of the nativity scene. (The pi\u00e9droit is the stone at the bottom part of an arch up until the point when the arch starts to curve; the stones in the curved part of the arch are called voussures and it was common practice at the time to carve both stones.) The double band of pi\u00e9droits and voussures in the Pencran porch arch portray scenes from the [[Book of Genesis]]. In the first nine stones and alternating between left and right we see a depiction of the temptation of Adam and Eve with a tree around which is a coiled snake who offers Eve the forbidden fruit. Move to the right hand side and we see an angel brandishing a sword and throwing the couple out of [[Paradise]] which is symbolised by a tree laden with leaves. In other scenes we see Cain and Abel lighting sacrificial fires. Cain fails to get his fire burning and the smoke blows back into his eyes which he shields with his right hand. Abel is more successful with his fire. We also see Cain murdering his brother. In other pi\u00e9droits, there is a depiction of Noah's ark carrying Noah and his family and animals and of Noah picking grapes. He lifts his tunic to create a fold so that he can carry as many grapes as possible. A smaller carving shows Noah intoxicated having overdone the sampling of his wine! The outside of the porch is decorated in the [[Flamboyant Gothic]] style, the buttresses topped with [[pinnacle]]s. After the biblical scenes from the [[Book of Genesis]], there are depictions in the final two pi\u00e9droits of the four evangelists with their usual attributes, with Mark and John on the left and Luke and Matthew on the right. We then have the voussures and in the double band are twenty one carvings depicting angels playing a variety of instruments; a veritable \"[[Heavenly Host]]\". Above the tympanum there is a small statue of the Virgin Mary with child. The remaining statuary can be found in the buttress niches. In the niche to the far left of the left buttress, there is a small version of the Virgin Mary before the cross. Her hands are clasped in prayer and she wears a veil. The right side buttress has Saint Suzanne in the central niche with another Virgin Mary and child in the first niche. Saint Suzanne reads a book and holds a folded scroll. In the final niche we have a depiction of Saint Ann teaching the Virgin Mary to read. Inside the church porch are statues of Christ and each of the apostles stood on a richly decorated domed dais.<ref name=fb>{{cite book|title=Sculpteurs sur pierre en Basse-Bretagne.

On the upper crosspiece are statues of two cavaliers on horseback both looking up at Jesus. On the reverse side of Jesus hanging on the cross there is an \"Ecce Homo\" or \"Christ li\u00e9\".

The church's nave is divided into three sections divided by a double row of [[ogive]] arches. The church has a 16th-century wooden altarpiece in high relief depicting the [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet|Lamentations]] with the Virgin Mary and others grouped around the body of Jesus which had just been brought down from the cross. The Virgin Mary is the centre of the composition with the body of Jesus stretched across her lap. She is accompanied by Saint John and Mary Magdalene. At their rear are various people including Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus and two servants who carry the crown of thorns. There is an inscription near the work reading \"MIL V CEST XVII CENT FUST S DOUGUEL VROY IS\". The church is rich in statues including Saint Hyacinthe, Saint Roch, Saint Maudit, Saint Herbot and Saint Eloi. Additionally there are statues of Saint Francis, Saint Yves and Saint Corentin.

In the semifinals of that tournament he staged a third-set comeback to defeat [[John McEnroe]] 6\u20134, 5\u20137, 7\u20136<sup>(4)</sup> after saving two match points at 2\u20135 in the third set and after coming back from 2\u20134 in the third-set tiebreaker. (Ycaza was to face McEnroe three more times in junior tournaments, winning each time.) In the final, Ycaza defeated [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc]] of Argentina. In May 1977, Ycaza again defeated John McEnroe 6\u20137, 6\u20134, 6\u20132 to win the World Championship of Tennis Men's 21-and-under tournament in [[Houston, Texas]].\n\nCoached by [[Miguel Olvera]] at the [[Guayaquil Tennis Club]], Ycaza had a successful junior career, winning numerous South American junior titles. At the college level, he achieved [[All-American]] status for the 1976\u20131977 [[NCAA]] season playing for the [[University of Houston]]. Ycaza represented [[Ecuador Davis Cup team|Ecuador]] in [[Davis Cup]] matches from [[1973 Davis Cup|1973]] through [[1986 Davis Cup|1986]], teaming up with long-time friend and [[French Open]] champion [[Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez]] in several important doubles triumphs against the likes of [[Argentina Davis Cup team|Argentina]] and [[Brazil Davis Cup team|Brazil]]. After his playing days were over, Ycaza also served as Davis Cup captain for Ecuador.\n\nYcaza played on the professional tennis tour from 1977 to 1986. His career high rankings was World No. 45 in singles and No. 32 in doubles. During his professional career, he won three doubles tournaments (each with different partners).
