The dedication took place in a Pottukattu ceremony that was somewhat similar to a marriage ceremony.  In addition to taking care of the temple and performing rituals, these women also learned and practiced classical Indian artistic traditions such as [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kuchipudi]], and [[Odissi]] dances. Their social status was high as dance and music were an essential part of temple worship.\n\nAfter becoming Devadasis, young women would spend their time learning religious rites, rituals, and dances. They sometimes had sexual relations with high officials or the priests who instructed them in music and dancing.\n\nDuring [[British Raj|British rule]] in the Indian subcontinent kings who were the patrons of temples, thus the temple artist communities lost their power. As a result, Devadasi were left without their traditional means of support and patronage. During colonial times reformists worked towards outlawing the Devadasi tradition. Colonial views on Devadasi are hotly disputed by several groups and organizations in India and by western academics. The [[United Kingdom|British]] were unable to distinguish the Devadasi from non-religious street dancers. This led to the socio-economic deprivation and adoption of folk arts.<ref>Crooke, W., , Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, Vol. X, Eds., James Hastings and Clark Edinburg, Second Impression, 1930.</ref><ref>Iyer, L.A.K, Devadasis in South India: Their Traditional Origin And Development, Man in India, Vol.7, No. 47, 1927.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=V.Jayaram |url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_prostitution.asp |title=Hinduism and prostitution |website=Hinduwebsite.com |accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/daudAli.html|title=Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God: Temple Women in Medieval Tamilnadu - Reviews in History|website=History.ac.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210025/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/daudAli.html|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRecently the Devadasi system has started to disappear.

Devadasi is sometimes referred to as a [[caste]]; however, some question the accuracy of this usage. \"According to the devadasi themselves there exists a devdasi 'way of life' or 'professional ethic' (vritti, murai) but not a devadasi j\u0101ti (sub-caste).

Similarly, there were 500 ''Devdasi'' at the ''Someshwer'' shrine of [[Gujarat]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Between the 6th and 13th centuries, ''Devadasi'' had a high rank and dignity in society and were exceptionally affluent as they were seen as the protectors of music and dance.

Both male and female Devadasi were dedicated to the service of a temple and its deity.

These dancers were known as ''Jakkulas''. As part of a social reform, a written agreement was made to formely end the practice.\n\n''\u0100dap\u0101pas'' were female attendants to the ladies of the families of [[Zamindar]]s. \u0100dap\u0101pas led a life of prostitution as they were not allowed to marry.

The term ''Devadasi'' referred to the women who danced inside the temple. Devadasi, or mahari, means \"those great women who can control natural human impulses, their five senses and can submit themselves completely to God (Vachaspati).\" Mahari means ''Mahan Nari'' that is, the woman belonging to God. [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu|Sri Chaitanayadev]] had defined Devadasis as ''Sebayatas'' who served God through dance and music. [[Pankaj Charan Das]], the oldest guru of [[Odissi]] classical dance and who comes from a Mahari family, defines Mahari as ''Maha Ripu-Ari'', one who conquers the five main ripus - enemies.<ref name=\"MHO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhap.nic.in/homepages/Appan/maharis.html|title=The Sacred &amp; the Profane -The Conference &#124; Mahari of Odisha|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930103507/http://www.ukhap.nic.in/homepages/Appan/maharis.html|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other parts of India, the Odia Mahari Devadasis were never sexually liberal and were expected to remain celibate upon becoming Devadasis. However, there are records of Odia Mahari Devadasi having relationships and children. It is said that the daughters of the Maharis of the Jagannath temple took to other professions such as nursing in the mid-20th century due to stigma attached to their inherent profession, which may suggest prostitution.\n\nThe 1956 Orissa Gazette lists nine Devadasis and eleven temple musicians. By 1980, only four Devadasis were left \u2013 Harapriya, Kokilaprabha, Parashmani, and [[Sashimani|Shashimani]]. By 1998, only Shashimani and Parashmani were still alive. The daily ritualistic dance had stopped, although Shashimani and Parashmani served in a few of the yearly temple rituals such as ''Nabakalebara'', ''Nanda Utsava'', and ''Duara Paka'' during ''Bahuda Jatra''.<ref name=\"MHO\"/> The last of the Devadasis, Shashimani, died on 19 March 2015, at the age of 92.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/world/asia/sashimani-devi-last-of-indias-jagannath-temple-ritual-dancers-dies-at-92.html?_r=0|title = Sashimani Devi, Last of India's Jagannath Temple Dancers, Dies at 92|date = 23 March 2015|website = The New York Times|last = Barry|first = Ellen}}</ref>\n\n====Yellamma Cult of Karnataka in South India====\nIn the southern Indian state of Karnataka the Devadasi system was practiced for over 10 centuries. Chief among them was the [[Yellamma]] cult.<ref name=\"YM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/people/yellamma/yellamma.htm|website=Kamat.com|title=The Yellamma Cult of India|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are many stories about the origin of the Yellamma cult. The most popular story indicates that Renuka was the daughter of a [[Brahmin]], married the sage [[Jamadagni]], and was the mother of five sons. She used to bring water from the [[Malaprabha]] river for the sage's worship and rituals. One day at the river she saw a group of youths engaged in water sports and forgot to return home in time for her husband's worship and rituals, which made Jamadagni question her chastity. He ordered their sons one by one to punish their mother, but four of them refused on one pretext or the other. The sage cursed them to become [[eunuchs]] and had Renuka beheaded by his fifth son, Parashuram. To everybody's astonishment, Renuka's head multiplied by tens and hundreds and moved to different regions. This miracle inspired her four eunuch sons as well as others to become her followers and worship her head.<ref name=\"YMSlaves\">[http://cpamedia.com/culture/slave_girls_yellama/ Yellamma Slaves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328144857/http://www.cpamedia.com/culture/slave_girls_yellama/ |date=28 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Colonial Era===\n\n====Reformists and abolitionists====\nReformists and abolitionists considered the Devadasi a social evil due to their way of life, which seemed like prostitution according to the western eye. The first anti-[[Nautch]] and anti-dedication movement began in 1882. The portrayal of the Devadasi system as \"prostitution\" was done to advertise the supposed grotesqueness of Indian culture for political means, even though the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial authorities officially maintained most brothels in India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24530198|title=Horrors of India's brothels documented|date=2013-11-23|access-date=2019-03-26|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nAs the Devadasi were equated with prostitutes, they also became associated with the spread of the [[venereal disease]] [[syphilis]] in India. During the British colonial period many British soldiers were exposed to venereal diseases in brothels, and Devadasis were misunderstood to be responsible. In an effort to control the spread of venereal disease the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves. Devadasis were forced to register, as they were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.\n\nIn addition to obligatory registration, the British Government also established institutions known as [[Lock Hospitals]] where women were brought in order to be treated for venereal diseases. However, many of the women admitted to these hospitals, including many Devadasi, were identified through the registry and then brought to the hospitals against their will. A number of these women were never seen again by their families.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soneji|first=Davesh|title=Unfinished Gestures: Devadasis, Memory and Modernity in South India|year=2012|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-76809-0|pages=112}}</ref>\n\nToday, [[Sitavva Joddati]] of Karnataka helps former Devadasi find a foothold in mainstream society. In 1982 she was made a Devadasi at age seven. In 1997 she began the non-governmental organisation MASS (Mahila Abhivrudhi-Samrakshana Sansthe) in the [[Belagavi]] district of [[Ghataprabha]] to help women like her escape the Devadasi system and live a life of dignity. Between 1997 and 2017 MASS helped over 4,800 Devadasis reintegrate into mainstream society.

She altered the dance repertoire to exclude pieces perceived as erotic in their description of a deity. She also systematized the dance in a way that incorporated the extension and use of space associated with dance traditions such as ballet. The product of this transformation was a new version of [[Bharatanatyam|Bharatnatyam]], which she taught professionally at the ''Kalakshetra'' school she established in Madras. Bharatnatyam is commonly seen as a very ancient dance tradition associated with the Natyasastra. However, Bharatnatyam as it is performed and known today is actually a product of Arundale's recent endeavour to remove the Devadasi dance tradition from the perceived immoral context associated with the Devadasi community and bring it into the upper caste performance milieu.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soneji|first=Davesh|title=Bharatnatyam: A reader|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=India|isbn=978-0-19-808377-1}}</ref> She also adopted a lot of technical elements of Ballet into the modified form of Bharathanatyam.\n\n===Legislative Initiatives===\nThe first legal initiative to outlaw the Devadasi system dates back to the 1934 [[Bombay Devadasi Protection Act]]. This act pertained to the [[Bombay]] province as it existed in the [[British Raj]]. The Bombay Devadasi Protection Act made dedication of women illegal, whether consensual or not. In 1947, the year of Indian independence, the [[Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act]] outlawed dedication in the southern [[Madras Presidency]]. The Devadasi system was formally outlawed in all of India in 1988, although some Devadasis still practice illegally.<ref name=\"skepdic.dev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/devadasi.html|title=devadasi, at The Skeptic's Dictionary|website=Skepdic.com|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Devadasi practices==\n\nFrom the late medieval period until 1910, the Pottukattu or ''tali-tying'' dedication ceremony, was a widely advertised community event requiring the full cooperation of the local religious authorities. It initiated a young girl into the Devadasi profession and was performed in the temple by a priest. In the Brahminical tradition,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} marriage is viewed as the only religious initiation (''diksha'') permissible to women. Thus, the dedication was a symbolic \"marriage\" of the pubescent girl to the temple's deity.\n\nIn the ''sadanku'' or puberty ceremonies, the Devadasi initiate began her marriage with an emblem of the god borrowed from the temple as a stand-in [[bridegroom]]. From then onward, the Devadasi was considered a ''nitya sumangali'', a woman eternally free from the adversity of widowhood. She would then perform her ritual and artistic duties in the temple. The puberty ceremonies were not only a religious occasion, but also a community feast and celebration in which the local elites also participated.\n\n===Odisha===\nThe 1956 Orissa Gazette references Devadasis dances. They had two daily rituals. The ''Bahara Gaaunis'' would dance at the ''Sakaala Dhupa''. After breakfast [[Jagannath|Lord Jagannatha]] would give Darshana to the ''bhaktas'' (the devotees). In the main hall, a Devadasi, accompanied by musicians and the Rajaguru (the court guru), would dance standing near the [[Garuda]] stambha (pillar). They would perform only pure dance, and could be watched by the audience. The ''Bhitara Gaunis'' would sing at the ''Badashinghara'', the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. At bedtime, Lord Jagannatha would first be served by male Sebayatas, who would fan him and decorate him with flowers. After they left, a ''Bhitara Gaauni'' would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijaya), sing [[Gita Govinda]] songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. Later she would come out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and the guard would close the main gate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Social status==\nTraditionally, no stigma was attached to a Devadasi or to her children, and other members of their caste received them on terms of equality. The children of a Devadasi were considered legitimate, and Devadasis themselves were outwardly indistinguishable from married women of their own community.\n\nFurthermore, a Devadasi was believed to be immune from widowhood and was called ''akhanda saubhagyavati'' (\"woman never separated from good fortune\"). Since she was wedded to a divine deity, she was supposed to be one of the especially welcome guests at weddings and was regarded as a bearer of good fortune. At weddings, people would receive a string of the ''tali'' (wedding lock) prepared by her, threaded with a few beads from her own [[necklace]]. The presence of a Devadasi on any religious occasion in the house of an [[Upper-caste|upper caste]] member was regarded as sacred and she was treated with due respect, and was presented with gifts.\n\n==Contemporary statistical data==\nIndian [[National Commission for Women]], which is mandated to protect and promote the welfare of women, collected information on the prevalence of Devadasi culture in various states. The government of [[Odisha]] stated that the Devadasi system is not prevalent in the state. There is only one Devadasi in Odisha, in a [[Puri]] temple. In March 2015, a newspaper report said that the last devadasi, Sashimoni, attached to [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath temple]] had died, bringing the curtain down on the institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2016/02/the-last-devadasi/|title=The last devadasi|date=18 February 2016|website=Forwardpress.in|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] wrote that this system has been eradicated and there are now no Devadasis in the state. [[Andhra Pradesh]] has identified 16,624 Devadasis within its state and [[Karnataka]] has identified 22,941. The government of [[Maharashtra]] did not provide the information as sought by the Commission. However, the state government provided statistical data regarding the survey conducted by them to sanction a \"Devadasi Maintenance Allowance\". A total of 8,793 applications were received and after conducting a survey 6,314 were rejected and 2,479 Devadasis were declared eligible for the allowance. At the time of sending the information, 1,432 Devadasis were receiving this allowance.\n\nAccording to a study by the Joint Women's Programme of Bangalore for National Commission for Women, girls who have to accept becoming a Devadasi, few reasons were provided, which included dumbness, deafness, poverty, and others.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite web|url=http://www.samarthbharat.com/files/devadasihistory.pdf|title=DEVADASIS \u2013 SINNERS OR SINNED AGAINST: An attempt to look at the myth and reality of history and present status of Devadasis|author=Anil Chawla|website=Samarthbharat.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> The [[life expectancy]] of Devadasi girls is low compared to the average of the country, it is rare to find Devadasis older than fifty.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Title\n!Medium\n!Comment\n!Source\n|-\n|1976\n|''Bala''\n|Dance performance of [[Balasaraswati]] in the documentary, directed by [[Satyajit Ray]].\n|Joint production of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] and the [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]].\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Bala1976SatyajitRayDocumentaryOnT.Balasaraswati|title=Bala ( 1976) Satyajit Ray Documentary On T.

The dedication took place in a Pottukattu ceremony that was somewhat similar to a marriage ceremony.  In addition to taking care of the temple and performing rituals, these women also learned and practiced classical Indian artistic traditions such as [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kuchipudi]], and [[Odissi]] dances. Their social status was high as dance and music were an essential part of temple worship.\n\nAfter becoming Devadasis, young women would spend their time learning religious rites, rituals, and dances. They sometimes had children with high officials or the priests who instructed them in music and dancing.\n\nDuring [[British Raj|British rule]] in the Indian subcontinent kings who were the patrons of temples, thus the temple artist communities lost their power. As a result, Devadasi were left without their traditional means of support and patronage. During colonial times reformists worked towards outlawing the Devadasi tradition. Colonial views on Devadasi are hotly disputed by several groups and organizations in India and by western academics. The [[United Kingdom|British]] were unable to distinguish the Devadasi from non-religious street dancers. This led to the socio-economic deprivation and adoption of folk arts.<ref>Crooke, W., , Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, Vol. X, Eds., James Hastings and Clark Edinburg, Second Impression, 1930.</ref><ref>Iyer, L.A.K, Devadasis in South India: Their Traditional Origin And Development, Man in India, Vol.7, No. 47, 1927.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=V.Jayaram |url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_prostitution.asp |title=Hinduism and prostitution |website=Hinduwebsite.com |accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/daudAli.html|title=Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God: Temple Women in Medieval Tamilnadu - Reviews in History|website=History.ac.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210025/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/daudAli.html|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRecently the Devadasi system has started to disappear.

The term ''Devadasi'' referred to the women who danced inside the temple. Devadasi, or mahari, means \"those great women who can control natural human impulses, their five senses and can submit themselves completely to God (Vachaspati).\" Mahari means ''Mahan Nari'' that is, the woman belonging to God. [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu|Sri Chaitanayadev]] had defined Devadasis as ''Sebayatas'' who served God through dance and music. [[Pankaj Charan Das]], the oldest guru of [[Odissi]] classical dance and who comes from a Mahari family, defines Mahari as ''Maha Ripu-Ari'', one who conquers the five main ripus - enemies.<ref name=\"MHO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhap.nic.in/homepages/Appan/maharis.html|title=The Sacred &amp; the Profane -The Conference &#124; Mahari of Odisha|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930103507/http://www.ukhap.nic.in/homepages/Appan/maharis.html|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other parts of India, the Odia Mahari Devadasis were never sexually liberal and were expected to remain celibate upon becoming Devadasis. However, there are records of Odia Mahari Devadasi having relationships and children. It is said that the daughters of the Maharis of the Jagannath temple took to other professions such as nursing in the mid-20th century due to stigma attached to their inherent profession, which may suggest prostitution.\n\nThe 1956 Orissa Gazette lists nine Devadasis and eleven temple musicians. By 1980, only four Devadasis were left \u2013 Harapriya, Kokilaprabha, Parashmani, and [[Sashimani|Shashimani]]. By 1998, only Shashimani and Parashmani were still alive.

The most popular story indicates that Renuka was the daughter of a [[Brahmin]], married the sage [[Jamadagni]], and was the mother of five sons. She used to bring water from the [[Malaprabha]] river for the sage's worship and rituals. One day at the river she saw a group of youths engaged in water sports and forgot to return home in time for her husband's worship and rituals, which made Jamadagni question her chastity. He ordered their sons one by one to punish their mother, but four of them refused on one pretext or the other. The sage cursed them to become [[eunuchs]] and had Renuka beheaded by his fifth son, Parashuram. To everybody's astonishment, Renuka's head multiplied by tens and hundreds and moved to different regions. This miracle inspired her four eunuch sons as well as others to become her followers and worship her head.<ref name=\"YMSlaves\">[http://cpamedia.com/culture/slave_girls_yellama/ Yellamma Slaves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328144857/http://www.cpamedia.com/culture/slave_girls_yellama/ |date=28 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Colonial Era===\n\n====Reformists and abolitionists====\nReformists and abolitionists considered the Devadasi a social evil due to their way of life, which seemed like prostitution according to the western eye. The first anti-[[Nautch]] and anti-dedication movement began in 1882. The portrayal of the Devadasi system as \"prostitution\" was done to advertise the supposed grotesqueness of Indian culture for political means, even though the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial authorities officially maintained most brothels in India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24530198|title=Horrors of India's brothels documented|date=2013-11-23|access-date=2019-03-26|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nAs the Devadasi were equated with prostitutes, they also became associated with the spread of the [[venereal disease]] [[syphilis]] in India. During the British colonial period many British soldiers were exposed to venereal diseases in brothels, and Devadasis were misunderstood to be responsible. In an effort to control the spread of venereal disease the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves. Devadasis were forced to register, as they were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.\n\nIn addition to obligatory registration, the British Government also established institutions known as [[Lock Hospitals]] where women were brought in order to be treated for venereal diseases. However, many of the women admitted to these hospitals, including many Devadasi, were identified through the registry and then brought to the hospitals against their will. A number of these women were never seen again by their families.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soneji|first=Davesh|title=Unfinished Gestures: Devadasis, Memory and Modernity in South India|year=2012|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-76809-0|pages=112}}</ref>\n\nToday, [[Sitavva Joddati]] of Karnataka helps former Devadasi find a foothold in mainstream society. In 1982 she was made a Devadasi at age seven. In 1997 she began the non-governmental organisation MASS (Mahila Abhivrudhi-Samrakshana Sansthe) in the [[Belagavi]] district of [[Ghataprabha]] to help women like her escape the Devadasi system and live a life of dignity. Between 1997 and 2017 MASS helped over 4,800 Devadasis reintegrate into mainstream society. In 2018 she received the [[Padmashri]] award at age 43.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/viral-and-trending/270118/urban-legend-conquering-a-cult-seetavva-shows-it-can-be-done.html|title=Urban Legend: Conquering a cult \u2013 Seetavva shows it can be done|date=27 January 2018|website=Deccanchronicle.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/zp-honours-padma-shri-jodatti/article22616617.ece|title=ZP honours Padma Shri Jodatti|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=20 November 2018|website=Thehindu.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/padma-awardee-sitavva-mysuru-resident-find-mention-in-pm-modis-mann-ki-baat/articleshow/62688367.cms|title=Padma awardee Sitavva, Mysuru resident find mention in PM Modi's Mann ki Baat |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Evolution of Bharathanatyam====\n[[Rukmini Devi Arundale]], a [[theosophist]] trained in ballet, sought to re-appropriate the Devadasi dance traditions in a context perceived respectably by Indian society which had by then adopted the western morales. She altered the dance repertoire to exclude pieces perceived as erotic in their description of a deity. She also systematized the dance in a way that incorporated the extension and use of space associated with dance traditions such as ballet. The product of this transformation was a new version of [[Bharatanatyam|Bharatnatyam]], which she taught professionally at the ''Kalakshetra'' school she established in Madras. Bharatnatyam is commonly seen as a very ancient dance tradition associated with the Natyasastra. However, Bharatnatyam as it is performed and known today is actually a product of Arundale's recent endeavour to remove the Devadasi dance tradition from the perceived immoral context associated with the Devadasi community and bring it into the upper caste performance milieu.<ref>{{cite book|last=Soneji|first=Davesh|title=Bharatnatyam: A reader|year=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=India|isbn=978-0-19-808377-1}}</ref> She also adopted a lot of technical elements of Ballet into the modified form of Bharathanatyam.\n\n===Legislative Initiatives===\nThe first legal initiative to outlaw the Devadasi system dates back to the 1934 [[Bombay Devadasi Protection Act]]. This act pertained to the [[Bombay]] province as it existed in the [[British Raj]]. The Bombay Devadasi Protection Act made dedication of women illegal, whether consensual or not. In 1947, the year of Indian independence, the [[Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act]] outlawed dedication in the southern [[Madras Presidency]]. The Devadasi system was formally outlawed in all of India in 1988, although some Devadasis still practice illegally.<ref name=\"skepdic.dev\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/devadasi.html|title=devadasi, at The Skeptic's Dictionary|website=Skepdic.com|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Devadasi practices==\n\nFrom the late medieval period until 1910, the Pottukattu or ''tali-tying'' dedication ceremony, was a widely advertised community event requiring the full cooperation of the local religious authorities. It initiated a young girl into the Devadasi profession and was performed in the temple by a priest. In the Brahminical tradition,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} marriage is viewed as the only religious initiation (''diksha'') permissible to women. Thus, the dedication was a symbolic \"marriage\" of the pubescent girl to the temple's deity.\n\nIn the ''sadanku'' or puberty ceremonies, the Devadasi initiate began her marriage with an emblem of the god borrowed from the temple as a stand-in [[bridegroom]]. From then onward, the Devadasi was considered a ''nitya sumangali'', a woman eternally free from the adversity of widowhood. She would then perform her ritual and artistic duties in the temple. The puberty ceremonies were not only a religious occasion, but also a community feast and celebration in which the local elites also participated.\n\n===Odisha===\nThe 1956 Orissa Gazette references Devadasis dances. They had two daily rituals. The ''Bahara Gaaunis'' would dance at the ''Sakaala Dhupa''. After breakfast [[Jagannath|Lord Jagannatha]] would give Darshana to the ''bhaktas'' (the devotees). In the main hall, a Devadasi, accompanied by musicians and the Rajaguru (the court guru), would dance standing near the [[Garuda]] stambha (pillar). They would perform only pure dance, and could be watched by the audience. The ''Bhitara Gaunis'' would sing at the ''Badashinghara'', the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. At bedtime, Lord Jagannatha would first be served by male Sebayatas, who would fan him and decorate him with flowers. After they left, a ''Bhitara Gaauni'' would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijaya), sing [[Gita Govinda]] songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. Later she would come out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and the guard would close the main gate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Social status==\nTraditionally, no stigma was attached to a Devadasi or to her children, and other members of their caste received them on terms of equality. The children of a Devadasi were considered legitimate, and Devadasis themselves were outwardly indistinguishable from married women of their own community.\n\nFurthermore, a Devadasi was believed to be immune from widowhood and was called ''akhanda saubhagyavati'' (\"woman never separated from good fortune\"). Since she was wedded to a divine deity, she was supposed to be one of the especially welcome guests at weddings and was regarded as a bearer of good fortune. At weddings, people would receive a string of the ''tali'' (wedding lock) prepared by her, threaded with a few beads from her own [[necklace]]. The presence of a Devadasi on any religious occasion in the house of an [[Upper-caste|upper caste]] member was regarded as sacred and she was treated with due respect, and was presented with gifts.\n\n==Contemporary statistical data==\nIndian [[National Commission for Women]], which is mandated to protect and promote the welfare of women, collected information on the prevalence of Devadasi culture in various states. The government of [[Odisha]] stated that the Devadasi system is not prevalent in the state. There is only one Devadasi in Odisha, in a [[Puri]] temple. In March 2015, a newspaper report said that the last devadasi, Sashimoni, attached to [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath temple]] had died, bringing the curtain down on the institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2016/02/the-last-devadasi/|title=The last devadasi|date=18 February 2016|website=Forwardpress.in|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] wrote that this system has been eradicated and there are now no Devadasis in the state. [[Andhra Pradesh]] has identified 16,624 Devadasis within its state and [[Karnataka]] has identified 22,941. The government of [[Maharashtra]] did not provide the information as sought by the Commission. However, the state government provided statistical data regarding the survey conducted by them to sanction a \"Devadasi Maintenance Allowance\". A total of 8,793 applications were received and after conducting a survey 6,314 were rejected and 2,479 Devadasis were declared eligible for the allowance. At the time of sending the information, 1,432 Devadasis were receiving this allowance.\n\nAccording to a study by the Joint Women's Programme of Bangalore for National Commission for Women, girls who have to accept becoming a Devadasi, few reasons were provided, which included dumbness, deafness, poverty, and others.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite web|url=http://www.samarthbharat.com/files/devadasihistory.pdf|title=DEVADASIS \u2013 SINNERS OR SINNED AGAINST: An attempt to look at the myth and reality of history and present status of Devadasis|author=Anil Chawla|website=Samarthbharat.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> The [[life expectancy]] of Devadasi girls is low compared to the average of the country, it is rare to find Devadasis older than fifty.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Title\n!Medium\n!Comment\n!Source\n|-\n|1976\n|''Bala''\n|Dance performance of [[Balasaraswati]] in the documentary, directed by [[Satyajit Ray]].\n|Joint production of the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] and the [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]].\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Bala1976SatyajitRayDocumentaryOnT.Balasaraswati|title=Bala ( 1976) Satyajit Ray Documentary On T.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub.

Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

It is also used for treating 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold' and 'cough or asthma caused by excessive [[phlegm]] or [[neurasthenia]]'.\nNote : the medical concept neurasthenia \u2013 now largely abandoned in Western medicine \u2013 is expressed in Chinese as ''shenjing shuairuo'' (simplified Chinese: \u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u5f31), a compound of ''shenjing'' 'nervous' and ''shuairuo'' 'weakness', and the Chinese condition so described is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] encompassing debility, emotional turmoil, excitement, tension-induced pain and sleep disturbances, caused by a depletion of [[qi]] ('vital energy') and impaired functioning of the [[Zang-fu#Five System|''wuzang'']] (= 'five vital organs').<ref>Schwartz, Pamela Yew (September 2002). \"Why is neurasthenia important in Asian cultures?\".

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|left|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) ''Tchindat'' (= ''Chindanturuk'') on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart E-8, 6th edition.jpg|thumb|U.S. navigation chart covering Dauria (Transbaikalia), showing ''Chindanturuk'' under the name ''Chindant pervyy'' i.e. \"First (=oldest) Chindant\", north of salt lakes Barun-Torey and Zu(u)n-Torey on the border with Mongolia (bottom centre).]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]] (Mongolian: ''Boorj''), a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences 1771-1776</ref> but more widely known in the French translation of 1793.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\">Pallas, Peter Simon ''Voyages de m. P.S. Pallas en differentes provinces de l'Empire de Russie et dans l'Asie septentrionale, traduit de l'Allemande par m. Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to ''Chindanturuk'' never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream ''Udagata\u00ef'', one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal. Entheogens, as their name suggests, are generally used in a ritual or religious setting,<ref>Furst, Peter T. ''Hallucinogens and Culture'' pub.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia.

V) BHL285489.jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' (listed in text as 'Hyoscyamus physalodes') : plate 5 in ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants') pub. [[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

Sansom).]]\n[[File:Physochlaina orientalis mid shot.jpg|thumb|''P. orientalis'' flowering in [[Oxford Botanic Garden]] on the 25th of March 2017.]]\nGeorge Don notes of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in his ' ''A General History...'' ' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] )</ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub. Elsevier.</ref>\n\nThe nomenclatural association of ''P. infundibularis'' with Mount Hua \u2013 'West Great Mountain' of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Five Great Mountains of China]] of [[Taoism]] \u2013  is an interesting one and merits further study : in common with other mountains regarded in China as [[numinous]]/[[Xian ling]], Mount Hua (a precipitous assemblage of five (counted anciently only as three) peaks in the [[Qin Mountains|Qin range]]) is held to be a source of rare medicinal plants and life-prolonging [[Elixir of life|elixirs]]. Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

In the traditional systems of medicine in China and Mongolia it is considered to have the effects of 'combatting weakness', 'warming up the [[stomach]]', 'soothing the mental condition' and relieving asthma. It is also used for treating 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold' and 'cough or asthma caused by excessive [[phlegm]] or [[neurasthenia]]'.\nNote : the medical concept neurasthenia \u2013 now largely abandoned in Western medicine \u2013 is expressed in Chinese as ''shenjing shuairuo'' (simplified Chinese: \u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u5f31), a compound of ''shenjing'' 'nervous' and ''shuairuo'' 'weakness', and the Chinese condition so described is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] encompassing debility, emotional turmoil, excitement, tension-induced pain and sleep disturbances, caused by a depletion of [[qi]] ('vital energy') and impaired functioning of the [[Zang-fu#Five System|''wuzang'']] (= 'five vital organs').<ref>Schwartz, Pamela Yew (September 2002). \"Why is neurasthenia important in Asian cultures?\".

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|left|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) ''Tchindat'' (= ''Chindanturuk'') on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:Operational Navigation Chart E-8, 6th edition.jpg|thumb|U.S. navigation chart covering Dauria (Transbaikalia), showing ''Chindanturuk'' under the name ''Chindant pervyy'' i.e. \"First (=oldest) Chindant\", north of salt lakes Barun-Torey and Zu(u)n-Torey on the border with Mongolia (bottom centre).]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]] (Mongolian: ''Boorj''), a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to ''Chindanturuk'' never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream ''Udagata\u00ef'', one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides'').

Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

[[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn.

Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

He commanded the 4/8th Gurkhas Rifles against the Japanese Army in [[Burma]] during the [[Second World War]]. He commanded the 1/6 Gurkha Rifles from 1950 to 1953 and he commanded the 99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade Group from 1957 to 1959 during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Walker was Director of Operations in [[Borneo]] from 1962 to 1965 during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]]. In retirement, he attracted some controversy by publicising his views on the political situation in Britain during the mid 1970s.\n\n==Early life==\nWalker was born on a tea plantation in [[British India]] to a military family, one of four sons. At the end of the [[First World War]] Walker and his family moved back to Britain and he was sent to [[Blundell's School]] in [[Devon]].<ref name=\"Barker\">[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,536426,00.html Dennis Barker, 'General Sir Walter Walker', ''The Guardian'', 14 August 2001]</ref> Even as a child Walker had a militaristic streak; in his memoirs ''Fighting On'' he writes that he ordered the previously \"idle, unpatriotic, unkempt\" pupils into \"showing the school what smartness on the parade ground meant\". His teachers became alarmed at Walker's strict behaviour and tried to explain the difference between \"driving\" and \"leading\".<ref>Andy Beckett, ''Pinochet in Piccadilly. Britain and Chile's Hidden History'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2003), pp. 192\u201393</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nWalker then went to the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and in 1933 after a short attachment to the [[Sherwood Foresters]] he joined the 1/[[8th Gurkha Rifles]] in [[Quetta]] which his grandfather had formerly commanded.<ref name=telegraph>''Daily Telegraph'' obituary, 13 August 2001</ref> In 1935 he survived the major earthquake that hit that city. The battalion moved to Assam in the aftermath where it remained until early 1939, Walker was appointed the battalion's adjutant in 1938.<ref>Pocock, pp. 20\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Walker moved with his battalion across India to [[Razmak]], on the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] facing [[Waziristan]], there had been turmoil on the Frontier since 1936, and operations were continuous, a mixture of defensive and offensive operations, some of them \"punitive operations\" against tribesman of the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]] in [[Empire of India|India]].<ref name=\"Beckett, p. 193\">Beckett, p. 193</ref> Walker distinguished himself and was recommended for the [[Military Cross]], he had come to senior officers' attention and was appointed staff captain at the [[Razmak Brigade]] headquarters. His attention to detail enabled him to excel in this role.<ref>Pocock p. 42 \u2013 51</ref> He was twice mentioned in dispatches for his role in the operations on the North West Frontier from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Guardian>''The Guardian'' obituary, 14 August 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1942, Walker was selected to attend the [[Staff College, Quetta|Staff College]] at Quetta. After this he was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO 3) on the staff of Lieutenant General Slim's [[Burma Corps]], joining them near the oil fields at Yenangyaung in mid April 1942. Walker remained with the HQ as it walked back to India, and was then appointed as an instructor at the Quetta staff college.<ref>Pocock, pp. 59\u201361</ref>\n\nIn early 1944, Walker was appointed second-in-command, alongside a new commanding officer, of the 4/8th Gurkha Rifles, who had suffered severely in the Arakan Campaign. In March the battalion was moved to the Imphal area where the Japanese had launched a major offensive and spent several months in hard fighting. In November he became the commanding officer, instigated a tough training regime and the battalion's motto \u2013 \"Live Hard, Fight Hard, and when necessary Die Hard\". Always a disciplinarian, he was a hard taskmaster and a totally professional soldier dedicated to hard training, and with his harsher characteristics balanced by integrity, generosity and warmth.<ref>Pocock, pp. 62\u201371</ref>\n\nIn early 1945 he led the 4/8th Gurkhas, part of [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]], across the River Irrawaddy and hard fighting against the main body of the Japanese Army in Burma.  In June he was appointed GSO 1 in his division's (7 Indian Division) Headquarters, although circumstances dictated that he had to return part-time to 4/8th Gurkhas as their commanding officer again. A highly unusual situation. He was mentioned in dispatches and at the end of the war he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO)<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> and [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] moved to occupy Thailand where Walker was involved in negotiating the surrender of Japanese forces in that country.<ref>Pocock, pp. 72\u201381</ref>\n\nWalker's first post-war posting was as GSO 1 to the Director of Military Operations in General Headquarters (GHQ), Delhi. When GHQ was transferred to Indian control in 1948 he handed over to a future Indian Chief of Army Staff and was appointed GSO 1 in Malaya District Headquarters in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\nIn 1948, the Emergency was declared in Malaya. Walker's immediate role was to train and equip the irregular Ferret Force. In late 1948 he was appointed Commandant of the Far East Land Forces Training Centre in Johore Bahru with the task of training British units, arriving from UK, in jungle fighting. It later became the Jungle Warfare School at Kota Tinggi. He was appointed OBE for his work on Jungle warfare training.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> He also highlighted the many deficiencies in equipment and neglect of the lessons learned in Burma. He then had his first posting to UK as a student at the Joint Services Staff College. In 1950 he was appointed to command 1/6 Gurkha Rifles. Walker created a very effective jungle fighting battalion with many notable successes, including killing high ranking communists, in the three years he was in command.<ref>Pocock, pp. 82\u201398</ref>\n\nHe was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSO and was twice mentioned in dispatches during the Malayan Emergency.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> In 1954 he returned to the UK as a senior (Colonel) staff officer in Headquarters Eastern Command where he was involved in planning and mounting the Suez operation in 1956. He also expressed the view that if he had been commanding at [[Port Said]] he would have used a [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelsonian]] eye to signals from London telling him to stop. However, as an up-and-coming senior officer he was selected as an observer to [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|nuclear tests]] in [[Maralinga]], Australia and subsequently lectures on nuclear battlefield.<ref>Pocock, pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nIn 1957, he was promoted to Brigadier and commander of [[99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade]] Group in Malaya. This was the most demanding and important command in the Army with the task of finally defeating the most formidable remaining terrorists in Johore in Operation Tiger. Walker maintained an excellent relationship with police [[Special Branch]]; he took great pains in the development of intelligence, and made frequent use of ambushes. In Malaya, he demonstrated his mastery in ambush skills which he had initially learnt in Waziristan on India's North-West Frontier in 1939 to 1941.<ref>Charles Allen (1990) ''The Savage Wars of Peace,'' page 11</ref> He was recognised as a gifted trainer of troops, and had the gift of inspiring confidence and enthusiasm.<ref>Pocock, pp. 101\u201308</ref>\n\nIn 1959, 99th Brigade was sent to Singapore in advance of the forthcoming elections. Walker was told to take charge of internal security throughout Singapore Island. The 99th Brigade were highly skilled jungle fighters, but urban Singapore was a very different environment, and internal security an entirely new assignment. Walker immediately instituted a typically thorough training programme. No manual existed on the subject, so Walker wrote one. ''Internal Security in a City'' became the army standard on the subject. The elections passed peacefully. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Walker relinquished command<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> and attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London. He was unimpressed by the politically tuned officers and considered that politics was the business of politicians not soldiers.  After the course, in 1961, he was promoted to Major General and appointed General Officer Commanding [[17th Gurkha Division]] and Major General, [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]. 17 Division was the operational headquarters for all non-Malayan formations (99 Gurkha Infantry Brigade and 28 Commonwealth Brigade) and divisional units in Malaya.<ref>Pocock, pp. 109\u201310</ref>\n\nRumours about the axing of the Gurkhas emerged and Walker played an astute hand involving the King of Nepal and the U.S. Ambassador there to protect them. It did not endear him to the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] and he came close to being sacked. However, on 8 December 1962, while he was in Nepal visiting Gurkha pensioners in the [[Himalayas]]<ref>Charles Allen (1990) ''The Savage Wars of Peace,'' page 68.</ref> and some days walk from transport, a revolt broke out in [[Brunei]]. Walker reached Singapore 9 days later.<ref>Pocock, pp. 114\u201335</ref>\n\nWalker was appointed COMBRITBOR on 19 December with command over all British forces (land, sea and air) in the colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo, and the protectorate of Brunei. The revolt was quickly mopped up and incipient revolts in Sarawak prevented by an influx of British and Gurkha troops.  However, clues of Indonesian sympathy for the insurgents and emerging hostility caused Walker concern. The situation gradually evolved into the [[Konfrontasi|Confrontation]]. However, Walker was master of the situation and developed an effective operational concept and tactics to contain the threat, and most importantly retain the military initiative. The outcome was a successful campaign ending in August 1966. Walker handed over as commander in March 1965.<ref>Charles Allen (1990) ''The Savage Wars of Peace,'' page 95.</ref>\nDuring the campaign he established good relations with the Labour Defence and Army ministers ([[Denis Healey]] and [[Fred Mulley]]).<ref>Pocock, pp. 136\u2013217</ref> He was appointed [[Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath|CB]] and awarded a second bar to the DSO.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nHe returned to the UK and in 1965 was posted to [[NATO]] as Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of Plans, Operations and Intelligence, Headquarters, [[Allied Forces Central Europe]] in Paris where his job was to plan and execute the headquarters' move out of France. He accomplished this complex task on time and very efficiently. Promoted and knighted in 1968<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> he was appointed General Officer Commanding in Chief of [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]] in the UK from 1967.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> Finally in 1969 he was promoted to General and appointed [[NATO]]'s Commander in Chief [[Allied Forces Northern Europe]] with headquarters in Oslo. This covered German Jutland, Denmark and Norway but had no direct command responsibilities in peacetime. Walker saw his role as publicising the threat. The region faced an overwhelming and expanding Soviet force and while he did not expect Soviet direct attack he did see a strategic threat of expanding influence aimed at neutralising the Nordic countries (and possibly beyond) and clearing the path into the North Atlantic. Pointing this out did not endear him to some politicians and even his NATO superior.  He retired from the army in 1972.<ref>Pocock, pp. 222\u2013271</ref> Walker was Colonel of 7th (Duke of Edinburgh's Own) Gurkha Rifles from 1964 to 1975.\n\n==Politics==\nWalker then began giving [[television]] interviews and then took part in a documentary named ''A Day in the Life of a General'', which was never aired for security reasons, but Walker believed it was banned because he was \"revealing the true state of affairs which the politicians are hiding from the public\".<ref>Beckett, pp. 194\u201395</ref>\n\nBy 1974, Walker had grown \"shocked\" by the state of the country in general and the \"militancy\" of the trade unions in particular. In July of that year he wrote a letter to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' calling for \"dynamic, invigorating, uplifting leadership... above party politics\" to \"save\" the country from \"the Communist Trojan horse in our midst.\" After the publication of the letter, Walker claimed he received positive responses from [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] Sir [[Varyl Begg]], [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]] Sir [[John Slessor]], a few British [[general]]s, ex-MPs, the [[comedian]] [[Michael Bentine]] and the shipping industrialist [[Cayzer baronets|Lord Cayzer]].<ref name=\"Beckett, p. 196\">Beckett, p. 196</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, the ''[[London Evening News]]'' gave Walker a front-page interview and asked him if he could imagine a situation in which the [[British Army]] could take over Britain. Walker responded, \"Perhaps the country might choose rule by the gun in preference to anarchy,\"<ref name=\"Beckett, p. 196\"/> although Walker always said he hated the idea of a military government in Britain.<ref name=\"Barker\"/>\n\nBy August 1974, Walker had joined the anti-Communist Unison group (later renamed to [[Civil Assistance]]), which claimed that it would supply volunteers in the event of a [[general strike]].<ref>Beckett, p. 197</ref> Walker claimed it had at least 100,000 members, which led [[Defence Secretary]] [[Roy Mason]] to interrupt his holiday by condemning this \"near fascist groundswell.\"<ref>Beckett, p. 198</ref> In 1975, Walker travelled to various boardrooms in the City of London in the hope of securing money and support.<ref>Beckett, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref> After [[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Walker and [[Civil Assistance]] faded from the media; however, he still travelled abroad, including visits to [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>Beckett, p. 200</ref>\n\nWalker privately told journalists that he thought [[Harold Wilson]] was a \"proven Communist\" and that there was a \"Communist cell\" in [[Downing Street]].<ref>David Leigh, ''The Wilson Plot. The Intelligence Services and the discrediting of a Prime Minister'', London: Heinemann, 1988, p. 221.</ref> He advocated [[Enoch Powell]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and favoured \"tougher\" measures against the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. He was an early member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]] and in 1984 became Patron of the ultra-conservative and anti-communist [[Western Goals Institute]], a position he retained for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1980, his book ''The Next Domino?'', with a foreword by the Conservative politician [[Julian Amery]], was first published simultaneously in the UK, the US, and South Africa. In the 1980s, Walker's health began to decline and he underwent two hip operations in military hospitals. They left him permanently disabled which led to Walker suing the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1990. The suit was eventually settled out of court.<ref>Beckett, p. 201</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWalker married Beryl Johnston in 1939 with whom he was to have two sons and a daughter.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> He died on 12 August 2001.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/>\n\n==Honour==\n===Foreign honour===\n* {{flagu|Malaysia}} : Honorary Commander of the [[Order of the Defender of the Realm]] (1965)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/1965.pdf|title=Senarai Penuh Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan Tahun 1965.}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*''The Bear At the Back Door'', by General Sir Walter Walker, London, 1978.\n*''The Next Domino?'', by General Sir Walter Walker, KCB, CBE, DSO, with a foreword by the Rt.

He commanded the 4/8th Gurkhas Rifles against the Japanese Army in [[Burma]] during the [[Second World War]]. He commanded the 1/6 Gurkha Rifles from 1950 to 1953 and he commanded the 99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade Group from 1957 to 1959 during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Walker was Director of Operations in [[Borneo]] from 1962 to 1965 during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]]. In retirement, he attracted some controversy by publicising his views on the political situation in Britain during the mid 1970s.\n\n==Early life==\nWalker was born on a tea plantation in [[British India]] to a military family, one of four sons. At the end of the [[First World War]] Walker and his family moved back to Britain and he was sent to [[Blundell's School]] in [[Devon]].<ref name=\"Barker\">[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,3604,536426,00.html Dennis Barker, 'General Sir Walter Walker', ''The Guardian'', 14 August 2001]</ref> Even as a child Walker had a militaristic streak; in his memoirs ''Fighting On'' he writes that he ordered the previously \"idle, unpatriotic, unkempt\" pupils into \"showing the school what smartness on the parade ground meant\". His teachers became alarmed at Walker's strict behaviour and tried to explain the difference between \"driving\" and \"leading\".<ref>Andy Beckett, ''Pinochet in Piccadilly. Britain and Chile's Hidden History'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2003), pp. 192\u201393</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nWalker then went to the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and in 1933 after a short attachment to the [[Sherwood Foresters]] he joined the 1/[[8th Gurkha Rifles]] in [[Quetta]] which his grandfather had formerly commanded.<ref name=telegraph>''Daily Telegraph'' obituary, 13 August 2001</ref> In 1935 he survived the major earthquake that hit that city. The battalion moved to Assam in the aftermath where it remained until early 1939, Walker was appointed the battalion's adjutant in 1938.<ref>Pocock, pp. 20\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Walker moved with his battalion across India to [[Razmak]], on the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] facing [[Waziristan]], there had been turmoil on the Frontier since 1936, and operations were continuous, a mixture of defensive and offensive operations, some of them \"punitive operations\" against tribesman of the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]] in [[Empire of India|India]].<ref name=\"Beckett, p. 193\">Beckett, p. 193</ref> Walker distinguished himself and was recommended for the [[Military Cross]], he had come to senior officers' attention and was appointed staff captain at the [[Razmak Brigade]] headquarters. His attention to detail enabled him to excel in this role.<ref>Pocock p. 42 \u2013 51</ref> He was twice mentioned in dispatches for his role in the operations on the North West Frontier from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Guardian>''The Guardian'' obituary, 14 August 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1942, Walker was selected to attend the [[Staff College, Quetta|Staff College]] at Quetta. After this he was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO 3) on the staff of Lieutenant General Slim's [[Burma Corps]], joining them near the oil fields at Yenangyaung in mid April 1942. Walker remained with the HQ as it walked back to India, and was then appointed as an instructor at the Quetta staff college.<ref>Pocock, pp. 59\u201361</ref>\n\nIn early 1944, Walker was appointed second-in-command, alongside a new commanding officer, of the 4/8th Gurkha Rifles, who had suffered severely in the Arakan Campaign. In March the battalion was moved to the Imphal area where the Japanese had launched a major offensive and spent several months in hard fighting. In November he became the commanding officer, instigated a tough training regime and the battalion's motto \u2013 \"Live Hard, Fight Hard, and when necessary Die Hard\". Always a disciplinarian, he was a hard taskmaster and a totally professional soldier dedicated to hard training, and with his harsher characteristics balanced by integrity, generosity and warmth.<ref>Pocock, pp. 62\u201371</ref>\n\nIn early 1945 he led the 4/8th Gurkhas, part of [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]], across the River Irrawaddy and hard fighting against the main body of the Japanese Army in Burma.  In June he was appointed GSO 1 in his division's (7 Indian Division) Headquarters, although circumstances dictated that he had to return part-time to 4/8th Gurkhas as their commanding officer again. A highly unusual situation. He was mentioned in dispatches and at the end of the war he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO)<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> and [[7th Indian Infantry Division]] moved to occupy Thailand where Walker was involved in negotiating the surrender of Japanese forces in that country.<ref>Pocock, pp. 72\u201381</ref>\n\nWalker's first post-war posting was as GSO 1 to the Director of Military Operations in General Headquarters (GHQ), Delhi. When GHQ was transferred to Indian control in 1948 he handed over to a future Indian Chief of Army Staff and was appointed GSO 1 in Malaya District Headquarters in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\nIn 1948, the Emergency was declared in Malaya. Walker's immediate role was to train and equip the irregular Ferret Force. In late 1948 he was appointed Commandant of the Far East Land Forces Training Centre in Johore Bahru with the task of training British units, arriving from UK, in jungle fighting. It later became the Jungle Warfare School at Kota Tinggi. He was appointed OBE for his work on Jungle warfare training.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> He also highlighted the many deficiencies in equipment and neglect of the lessons learned in Burma. He then had his first posting to UK as a student at the Joint Services Staff College. In 1950 he was appointed to command 1/6 Gurkha Rifles. Walker created a very effective jungle fighting battalion with many notable successes, including killing high ranking communists, in the three years he was in command.<ref>Pocock, pp. 82\u201398</ref>\n\nHe was awarded a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSO and was twice mentioned in dispatches during the Malayan Emergency.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> In 1954 he returned to the UK as a senior (Colonel) staff officer in Headquarters Eastern Command where he was involved in planning and mounting the Suez operation in 1956. He also expressed the view that if he had been commanding at [[Port Said]] he would have used a [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelsonian]] eye to signals from London telling him to stop. However, as an up-and-coming senior officer he was selected as an observer to [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|nuclear tests]] in [[Maralinga]], Australia and subsequently lectures on nuclear battlefield.<ref>Pocock, pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nIn 1957, he was promoted to Brigadier and commander of [[99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade]] Group in Malaya. This was the most demanding and important command in the Army with the task of finally defeating the most formidable remaining terrorists in Johore in Operation Tiger. Walker maintained an excellent relationship with police [[Special Branch]]; he took great pains in the development of intelligence, and made frequent use of ambushes. In Malaya, he demonstrated his mastery in ambush skills which he had initially learnt in Waziristan on India's North-West Frontier in 1939 to 1941.<ref>Charles Allen (1990) ''The Savage Wars of Peace,'' page 11</ref> He was recognised as a gifted trainer of troops, and had the gift of inspiring confidence and enthusiasm.<ref>Pocock, pp. 101\u201308</ref>\n\nIn 1959, 99th Brigade was sent to Singapore in advance of the forthcoming elections. Walker was told to take charge of internal security throughout Singapore Island. The 99th Brigade were highly skilled jungle fighters, but urban Singapore was a very different environment, and internal security an entirely new assignment. Walker immediately instituted a typically thorough training programme. No manual existed on the subject, so Walker wrote one. ''Internal Security in a City'' became the army standard on the subject. The elections passed peacefully. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Walker relinquished command<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> and attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London. He was unimpressed by the politically tuned officers and considered that politics was the business of politicians not soldiers.  After the course, in 1961, he was promoted to Major General and appointed General Officer Commanding [[17th Gurkha Division]] and Major General, [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]. 17 Division was the operational headquarters for all non-Malayan formations (99 Gurkha Infantry Brigade and 28 Commonwealth Brigade) and divisional units in Malaya.<ref>Pocock, pp. 109\u201310</ref>\n\nRumours about the axing of the Gurkhas emerged and Walker played an astute hand involving the King of Nepal and the U.S. Ambassador there to protect them. It did not endear him to the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] and he came close to being sacked. However, on 8 December 1962, while he was in Nepal visiting Gurkha pensioners in the [[Himalayas]]<ref>Charles Allen (1990) ''The Savage Wars of Peace,'' page 68.</ref> and some days walk from transport, a revolt broke out in [[Brunei]]. Walker reached Singapore 9 days later.<ref>Pocock, pp. 114\u201335</ref>\n\nWalker was appointed COMBRITBOR on 19 December with command over all British forces (land, sea and air) in the colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo, and the protectorate of Brunei. The revolt was quickly mopped up and incipient revolts in Sarawak prevented by an influx of British and Gurkha troops.  However, clues of Indonesian sympathy for the insurgents and emerging hostility caused Walker concern. The situation gradually evolved into the [[Konfrontasi|Confrontation]]. However, Walker was master of the situation and developed an effective operational concept and tactics to contain the threat, and most importantly retain the military initiative. The outcome was a successful campaign ending in August 1966. Walker handed over as commander in March 1965.<ref>Charles Allen (1990) ''The Savage Wars of Peace,'' page 95.</ref>\nDuring the campaign he established good relations with the Labour Defence and Army ministers ([[Denis Healey]] and [[Fred Mulley]]).<ref>Pocock, pp. 136\u2013217</ref> He was appointed [[Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath|CB]] and awarded a second bar to the DSO.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nHe returned to the UK and in 1965 was posted to [[NATO]] as Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of Plans, Operations and Intelligence, Headquarters, [[Allied Forces Central Europe]] in Paris where his job was to plan and execute the headquarters' move out of France. He accomplished this complex task on time and very efficiently. Promoted and knighted in 1968<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> he was appointed General Officer Commanding in Chief of [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]] in the UK from 1967.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> Finally in 1969 he was promoted to General and appointed [[NATO]]'s Commander in Chief [[Allied Forces Northern Europe]] with headquarters in Oslo. This covered German Jutland, Denmark and Norway but had no direct command responsibilities in peacetime. Walker saw his role as publicising the threat. The region faced an overwhelming and expanding Soviet force and while he did not expect Soviet direct attack he did see a strategic threat of expanding influence aimed at neutralising the Nordic countries (and possibly beyond) and clearing the path into the North Atlantic. Pointing this out did not endear him to some politicians and even his NATO superior.  He retired from the army in 1972.<ref>Pocock, pp. 222\u2013271</ref> Walker was Colonel of 7th (Duke of Edinburgh's Own) Gurkha Rifles from 1964 to 1975.\n\n==Politics==\nWalker then began giving [[television]] interviews and then took part in a documentary named ''A Day in the Life of a General'', which was never aired for security reasons, but Walker believed it was banned because he was \"revealing the true state of affairs which the politicians are hiding from the public\".<ref>Beckett, pp. 194\u201395</ref>\n\nBy 1974, Walker had grown \"shocked\" by the state of the country in general and the \"militancy\" of the trade unions in particular. In July of that year he wrote a letter to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' calling for \"dynamic, invigorating, uplifting leadership... above party politics\" to \"save\" the country from \"the Communist Trojan horse in our midst.\" After the publication of the letter, Walker claimed he received positive responses from [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] Sir [[Varyl Begg]], [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]] Sir [[John Slessor]], a few British [[general]]s, ex-MPs, the [[comedian]] [[Michael Bentine]] and the shipping industrialist [[Cayzer baronets|Lord Cayzer]].<ref name=\"Beckett, p. 196\">Beckett, p. 196</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, the ''[[London Evening News]]'' gave Walker a front-page interview and asked him if he could imagine a situation in which the [[British Army]] could take over Britain. Walker responded, \"Perhaps the country might choose rule by the gun in preference to anarchy,\"<ref name=\"Beckett, p. 196\"/> although Walker always said he hated the idea of a military government in Britain.<ref name=\"Barker\"/>\n\nBy August 1974, Walker had joined the anti-Communist Unison group (later renamed to [[Civil Assistance]]), which claimed that it would supply volunteers in the event of a [[general strike]].<ref>Beckett, p. 197</ref> Walker claimed it had at least 100,000 members, which led [[Defence Secretary]] [[Roy Mason]] to interrupt his holiday by condemning this \"near fascist groundswell.\"<ref>Beckett, p. 198</ref> In 1975, Walker travelled to various boardrooms in the City of London in the hope of securing money and support.<ref>Beckett, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref> After [[Margaret Thatcher]] was elected leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Walker and [[Civil Assistance]] faded from the media; however, he still travelled abroad, including visits to [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>Beckett, p. 200</ref>\n\nWalker privately told journalists that he thought [[Harold Wilson]] was a \"proven Communist\" and that there was a \"Communist cell\" in [[Downing Street]].<ref>David Leigh, ''The Wilson Plot. The Intelligence Services and the discrediting of a Prime Minister'', London: Heinemann, 1988, p. 221.</ref> He advocated [[Enoch Powell]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and favoured \"tougher\" measures against the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. He was an early member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]] and in 1984 became Patron of the ultra-conservative and anti-communist [[Western Goals Institute]], a position he retained for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1980, his book ''The Next Domino?'', with a foreword by the Conservative politician [[Julian Amery]], was first published simultaneously in the UK, the US, and South Africa. In the 1980s, Walker's health began to decline and he underwent two hip operations in military hospitals. They left him permanently disabled which led to Walker suing the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1990. The suit was eventually settled out of court.<ref>Beckett, p. 201</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWalker married Beryl Johnston in 1939 with whom he was to have two sons and a daughter.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> He died on 12 August 2001.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/>\n\n==Honour==\n===Foreign honour===\n* {{flagu|Malaysia}} : Honorary Commander of the [[Order of the Defender of the Realm]] (1965)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/1965.pdf|title=Senarai Penuh Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan Tahun 1965.}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*''The Bear At the Back Door'', by General Sir Walter Walker, London, 1978.\n*''The Next Domino?'', by General Sir Walter Walker, KCB, CBE, DSO, with a foreword by the Rt.
