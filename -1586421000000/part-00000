Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series is also re-telecast from 28 March 2020 during the [[2020 India coronavirus lockdown|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

Like any tropical cyclone, there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high [[relative humidity|humidity]] in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough [[Coriolis effect]] to develop a [[low-pressure area|low pressure center]], (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical [[wind shear]]. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the [[subtropical ridge]] towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of [[Japan]]. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with [[China]] and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China.

For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to [[140th meridian west|140\u00b0W]]), central (140\u00b0W to 180\u00b0), and western (180\u00b0 to 100\u00b0E). The [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in [[Japan]], with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in [[Hawaii]] (the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]), the [[Philippines]] and [[Hong Kong]]. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.<ref name=\"HCT\">{{cite web | title = What is the difference between a hurricane, a cyclone, and a typhoon? | work = OCEAN FACTS | publisher = [[National Ocean Service]]  | url = http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html | accessdate = 2016-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the northwestern Pacific, there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm [[sea surface temperature]]s, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high [[relative humidity|humidity]] in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough [[Coriolis effect]] to develop a [[low-pressure area|low pressure center]], (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical [[wind shear]]. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms do occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the [[subtropical ridge]] towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of [[Japan]]. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with [[China]] and Japan being impacted slightly less. Some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives.

Staged in support of her extended play ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) and comprising a set list of songs from that and her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 2009 through 2011. Described as \"the first-ever pop electro opera\" by Gaga, the tour was announced in October 2009 after [[Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga|an intended joint concert tour]] with rapper [[Kanye West]] was suddenly canceled. The Monster Ball Tour commenced four days after the release of ''The Fame Monster'' in November 2009.\n\nA revision of the tour occurred after only a few months of performances, due to Gaga's concern that the original version was constructed within a very short span of time. The stage of the original show looked like a frame, comparable to that of a hollowed-out television set. Since ''The Fame Monster'' dealt with the [[paranoia]]s Gaga had faced, the main theme of the original shows became human evolution, while elements of the canceled tour with West were still included in some parts. From 2010 onwards, the revamped shows had a New York theme and portrayed a story set in the city, where Gaga and her friends got lost and had to find their way to \"the Monster Ball\". Both versions of the show were divided into five segments, with the last being the encore. Each of them featured Gaga in new outfits, singing songs related to the concept of the segment, as they were followed by a video interlude.\n\nThe tour received positive reviews, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities and the theatricality of the show. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with extra demand for tickets prompting organizers to add multiple dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4 million from 200 reported shows, attended by an audience of 2.5 million. At the 2010 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award. [[HBO]] filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was \"essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone3\"/> The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured in such a way that the box fit any stage. \"So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience.

[...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to.\" Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that she did not want to use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was \"the great lost tour\", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.<ref name=\"rollingstone3\"/>\n\nIn an interview with MTV News, Gaga further described the tour:\n<blockquote>\n\"I begin as a cell and I grow and change throughout the show. And it's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic, which is, you know, it's part pop, part performance art, part fashion installation\u2014so all of those things are present... It's a story, it's me battling all my monsters along the way. I'm playing all the music from ''The Fame'', all the music from ''The Fame Monster''. And the stage that I designed with the Haus [of Gaga] is a giant cube that sits. Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen.

Hence she was able to put together \"something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time\".<ref name=\"revamp\"/> The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. \"My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four times the size of the one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz.

Staged in support of her extended play ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) and comprising a set list of songs from that and her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 2009 through 2011. Described as \"the first-ever pop electro opera\" by Gaga, the tour was announced in October 2009 after [[Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga|an intended joint concert tour]] with rapper [[Kanye West]] was suddenly canceled. The Monster Ball Tour commenced four days after the release of ''The Fame Monster'' in November 2009.\n\nA revision of the tour occurred after only a few months of performances, due to Gaga's concern that the original version was constructed within a very short span of time. The stage of the original show looked like a frame, comparable to that of a hollowed-out television set. Since ''The Fame Monster'' dealt with the [[paranoia]]s Gaga had faced, the main theme of the original shows became human evolution, while elements of the canceled tour with West were still included in some parts. From 2010 onwards, the revamped shows had a New York theme and portrayed a story set in the city, where Gaga and her friends got lost and had to find their way to \"the Monster Ball\". Both versions of the show were divided into five segments, with the last being the encore. Each of them featured Gaga in new outfits, singing songs related to the concept of the segment, as they were followed by a video interlude.\n\nThe tour received positive reviews, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities and the theatricality of the show. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with extra demand for tickets prompting organizers to add multiple dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4 million from 200 reported shows, attended by an audience of 2.5 million. At the 2010 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award. [[HBO]] filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage, ''[[Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden]]'', aired in May and was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on November 21, 2011.\n\n== Background ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Lady Gaga Monster Ball 2009 DITD.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = A blond woman dancing in a blue dress, which has small glowing squirrels on it.

[...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to.\" Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that she did not want to use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was \"the great lost tour\", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.<ref name=\"rollingstone3\"/>\n\nIn an interview with MTV News, Gaga further described the tour:\n<blockquote>\n\"I begin as a cell and I grow and change throughout the show. And it's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic, which is, you know, it's part pop, part performance art, part fashion installation\u2014so all of those things are present...

Hence she was able to put together \"something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time\".<ref name=\"revamp\"/> The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. \"My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four times the size of the one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different.
