They released several albums throughout the 1980s and are best known for their hit single, 1984's \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\"\n\n==History==\n===Formation and classic years (1983\u20131988)===\nAutograph originally began in late 1983 as a solo project for singer, songwriter and guitarist Steve Plunkett, who had recently left the band [[Silver Condor (band)|Silver Condor]]. Plunkett was playing and recording his own material with a group of his musician friends, most of whom had previously played with him in other bands:\n\nOn lead guitar was [[Steve Lynch]], who had played with Plunkett in the band Looker.\n\nOn Bass was Randy Rand who knew Plunkett from their days in [[Pasadena, California]]'s club band Wolfgang, that has been described as a local legend of which [[Kevin Dubrow]] (lead singer of [[Quiet Riot]]) once said, \"They smoked us all... they got a better response than us and Van Halen\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Konow, David|title=Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]|date=2002|page=90|isbn= 978-0609807323}}</ref>\n\nOn keyboards, Steven Isham (born Steven E. Isham on November 30, 1952 in [[Pocatello, Idaho]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/idahostatejournal/obituary.aspx?pid=121265596|title=Steve Isham Obituary|website=Legacy.com}}</ref> who had also played with mutual acquaintance Holly Penfield, was brought in to give the band a more modern sound.\n\nOn drums was earlier bandmate, Keni Richards, that Plunkett knew from John Doe, rounding out the band's lineup with Richards' friendship of Van Halen lead singer, [[David Lee Roth]] being instrumental in leading to Autograph's big break the following year.\n\nThe group of musicians began playing and recording together, soon taking the form of an actual band.  Plunkett chose the name \"Autograph\" for the band, having been inspired by hearing [[Def Leppard]]'s similarly titled song, [[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|''Photograph'']], on the radio. They recorded their first rough demos in late 1983, but played them only for a few close friends. One of them was [[Andy Johns]], a famous record producer who Steve Plunkett had met while helping singer [[Joe Cerisano]] produce Silver Condor's second album ''Trouble At Home''. Johns invited the band to re-record and upgrade the demos at the world-famous [[Record Plant]] Studios for free under his guidance. Keni Richards then played the demo for Roth, who subsequently invited the band to open for Van Halen on their ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' tour. The band rose to prominence opening for Van Halen, ultimately playing 48 shows, an act of distinction for an unsigned band. Due to their rising popularity, Autograph soon signed a contract with [[RCA Records]] following a performance at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in late 1984.\n\nAutograph's debut album, ''[[Sign In Please]]'', was completed and released in October, but did not make an appearance on any record charts until January 1985. The album contains the band's only major hit, and now signature song, \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\" The song itself was one of the last ones recorded for the album, and the band members were initially very lukewarm toward it. However, the tune would become a top-30 hit, pushing album sales past the [[gold album]] mark (500,000 copies sold). The song was featured in an episode of \"[[Miami Vice]]\" (entitled \"Little Prince\") and was also leased out to numerous other films, even further elevating the song's popularity. Lynch's guitar work in \"Turn Up The Radio\", featuring a distinctive two-handed, fretboard-tapping technique, won him the \"Guitar Solo of the Year\" award from [[Guitar Player]] magazine in 1985.\n\n\"Send Her to Me\" was released as a follow-up single, though its success paled in comparison to the massive first hit.  Other songs from the ''Sign in Please'' album, \"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend Isn't Me\" and \"Deep End,\" along with \"Take No Prisoners,\" which would soon appear on the band's follow-up album, and were featured in the 1985 film ''[[Secret Admirer]],'' starring [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Corey Haim]], [[Lori Loughlin]] and [[Casey Siemaszko]]. The 1985 film ''[[Fright Night]]'' also included a song the band recorded titled \"You Can't Hide From the Beast Inside\".\n\nA second album, ''[[That's the Stuff]]'', was quickly recorded and released in the fall of 1985, and the group went on tour in support of several other bands, including [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Heart (band)|Heart]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Although record sales were disappointing in comparison to their first album, it still achieved near gold status. Supported by the single, \"Blondes in Black Cars\" and the title track, a minor-hit, it eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;92 on the Billboard album charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=autograph|chart=Billboard 200}} Autograph- album chart positions @Billboard.com] Retrieved 1-1-2012.</ref>  The band then recorded a song titled \"Winning Is Everything\" for the film ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]''.\n\nAutograph recorded a third album, which took longer to record than the other two combined and ''[[Loud and Clear (Autograph album)|Loud and Clear]]'' was released in the spring of 1987. The title song's music video featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Vince Neil]] of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] as extras. The band also made three appearances on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' in support of the album. In October, the band made a cameo in the film ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father, Like Son]]'', starring [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Kirk Cameron]]. The first song featured was \"Dance all Night,\" which played briefly, and then they performed the song \"She Never Looked That Good for Me\" for the film, appearing in a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as themselves. Despite all three of these songs being released as singles, the album was not a big success, mostly due to lackluster support from the label.\n\n===Leaving RCA and break up (1988\u20131989)===\nThe band left RCA Records in early 1988. Isham left the band to pursue other options but was not replaced, as the band felt they no longer needed keyboards and wanted to take a newer and heavier direction. The remaining members began recording a new album in 1988 which they hoped to release sometime the following year, but those plans never occurred due to lack of any type of label support.\n\nRichards also left the band around this time. However, in early 1989 the band toured with new drummer Eddie Cross and continued to sporadically record. The band would eventually be offered a new deal with [[Epic Records|Epic]] in 1989, which they declined.\n\nIn their short time they recorded three albums and toured with several famous bands, including [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Van Halen]], [[Bryan Adams]], and [[Whitesnake]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050205/http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|url-status=dead|title=Steve Lynch's Official Website|archivedate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> but in the end could not sustain their own career.\n\nDisappointed, the remaining members disbanded in December 1989.\n\n===Post break-up (1989\u20132013)===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2014}}\nThough the group had disbanded, a few of their music videos (most commonly \"Turn Up the Radio\") continued to be played on music video channels and programs such as [[MTV]]'s [[Headbangers Ball]] for several years after their initial debut. \n\n'''Steve Plunkett''' \u2013 When the original group disbanded in 1989, Plunkett became a staff writer and producer for All Nations Music, where he had over 170 of his songs released, including over 40 in movies like ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'', \"Brave New Girl\" (Britney Spears penned movie for ABC Family) and ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]''. Many artists have recorded his songs including [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]], [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Edgar Winter]].  He has also produced artists such as [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Graham Nash]] and [[En Vogue]].  He wrote and performed the theme song for the WB television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', as well as several other theme songs for shows such as ''[[Summerland (TV series)|Summerland]]'', ''Kojak'', and ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' which featured \"Behind the Mask\" performed by [[Jose Feliciano]]. Plunkett has had his original songs in hundreds of TV shows such as ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]].''\n\n'''Steve Lynch''' \u2013 The original lead guitarist has been a guitar teacher for several years, schooling students in his virtuosic signature 8-finger \"hammer-on\" guitar technique. He has also published several books on his guitar styles as well as an instructional video that has been a top seller worldwide. He has conducted 325 'guitar clinics' in 18 countries. He eventually formed another band named Network 23 and the album by the same name was released in 2004. He currently owns a music school in the Seattle area and completed a new teaching website called lynchlicks.com that went online in 2009.\n\n'''Randy Rand''' \u2013 The former bassist began a career in leather-making, establishing an international importing/exporting shop that sells his own hand-crafted leather products,  and even working with [[Harley Davidson]] for a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pp.auto.ke.orange.fr/|title=Orange|website=Pp.auto.ke.orange.fr}}</ref> According to Autograph's now-defunct \"Turn Up the Web!\" website, he has a daughter named Sterling Knight who has become a relatively well-known model in Italy.\n\n'''Keni Richards''' \u2013 The drummer went on to work with the band [[Dirty White Boy (band)|Dirty White Boy]], but later left the music business due to a chronic back problem he has had for several years. Nevertheless, he continued his passion for music and art, publicly saying he has no regrets. He also involved himself in songwriting and producing duties even after the band broke up and continued it even after band's reformation, wherein he participated for a short period of time. Richards died on April 8, 2017, reportedly in a drug-related homicide.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://sleazeroxx.com/ex-autograph-drummer-keni-richards-murdered-homicide-investigation-pending/|title=Ex-Autograph drummer Keni Richards murdered \u2014 homicide investigation pending |website=Sleazeroxx.com|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Steven Isham''' \u2013 The keyboardist joined up with [[Gary Moon]], who later replaced [[Jack Blades]] in the band [[Night Ranger]], to form The Pack, and he later went on to tour as the drummer for [[Vince Neil]]'s solo act. Remaining active in the music business throughout the ensuing years, Isham died on December 9, 2008, at the age of 56 from [[liver cancer]].\n\n'''Eddie Cross''' \u2013 The drummer of the Los Angeles band, Hot Wheelz, joined Autograph and played on its 1989 tour and the new tracks on the ''Missing Pieces'' CD.  He was later a member several other L.A. bands, including Bad Boys (with former members of [[Quiet Riot]]), Vigilante Man (with [[Guns N' Roses]] co-writer West Arkeen) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (who later joined Guns N' Roses).  In 1991, Cross went to law school in [[Orange County, California]], and has been President of Law Offices of Edward H. Cross & Associates, PC since 1995.  The firm opened in Santa Ana, California, relocated to Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i in 2004 and finally landed in Palm Desert, California, in 2005, where he practices construction and real estate law.  He has a daughter and a son and is a world traveler and an avid photographer.\n\n===Reunion (2013\u2013present)===\nIn late 2013, original members Steve Lynch, Randy Rand, and Keni Richards got back together for a reunion. Due to Plunkett not being interested in doing the reunion, they have replaced him with Jailhouse, Flood, 1RKO, solo artist singer/songwriter/guitarist Simon Daniels. The band has an interview in [[Guitar World]] Magazine, a review in Classic Rock and Fireworks magazines.\n\nSince 2014, by which time Richards had been replaced by Mark Wieland on drums, the band has played the Monsters of Rock Cruise, M3 Rock Festival, The Moondance Jam, The Halfway Jam, Firefest UK, Rockin the Rivers, The Iowa State Fair along with other festivals, theaters and worldwide touring.\n\nOn January 15, 2015, they released their first single, \"You Are Us, We Are You,\" on [[iTunes]]. On April 21, they released their 2nd single, \"I Lost My Mind in America,\" which made the Top 10 download of the charts. In July, the band was featured in [[USA Today NEWS]] after playing the famous Halfway Jam Rock Festival. On September 23, the band released their 3rd single \"Every Generation\" and is featured as track of the week on [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] Magazine.\n\nOn January 7, 2016, the new 5 song EP ''Louder'', with 4 original new singles and a live version of \"Turn up the Radio\", was released and is available on the official website.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, the band completed the recordings for the new full album which will be announced and released this year In March, the band had already toured the Midwest and Northeast US again, with shows in the UK and Germany and is booked solid for the rest of the year.\n\nOn April 8, 2017, Keni Richards died at the age of 60.

They released several albums throughout the 1980s and are best known for their hit single, 1984's \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\"\n\n==History==\n===Formation and classic years (1983\u20131988)===\nAutograph originally began in late 1983 as a solo project for singer, songwriter and guitarist Steve Plunkett, who had recently left the band [[Silver Condor (band)|Silver Condor]]. Plunkett was playing and recording his own material with a group of his musician friends, most of whom had previously played with him in other bands:\n\nOn lead guitar was [[Steve Lynch]], who had played with Plunkett in the band Looker.\n\nOn Bass was Randy Rand who knew Plunkett from their days in [[Pasadena, California]]'s club band Wolfgang, that has been described as a local legend of which [[Kevin Dubrow]] (lead singer of [[Quiet Riot]]) once said, \"They smoked us all... they got a better response than us and Van Halen\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Konow, David|title=Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]|date=2002|page=90|isbn= 978-0609807323}}</ref>\n\nOn keyboards, Steven Isham (born Steven E. Isham on November 30, 1952 in [[Pocatello, Idaho]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/idahostatejournal/obituary.aspx?pid=121265596|title=Steve Isham Obituary|website=Legacy.com}}</ref> who had also played with mutual acquaintance Holly Penfield, was brought in to give the band a more modern sound.\n\nOn drums was earlier bandmate, Keni Richards, that Plunkett knew from John Doe, rounding out the band's lineup with Richards' friendship of Van Halen lead singer, [[David Lee Roth]] being instrumental in leading to Autograph's big break the following year.\n\nThe group of musicians began playing and recording together, soon taking the form of an actual band.  Plunkett chose the name \"Autograph\" for the band, having been inspired by hearing [[Def Leppard]]'s similarly titled song, [[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|''Photograph'']], on the radio. They recorded their first rough demos in late 1983, but played them only for a few close friends. One of them was [[Andy Johns]], a famous record producer who Steve Plunkett had met while helping singer [[Joe Cerisano]] produce Silver Condor's second album ''Trouble At Home''. Johns invited the band to re-record and upgrade the demos at the world-famous [[Record Plant]] Studios for free under his guidance. Keni Richards then played the demo for Roth, who subsequently invited the band to open for Van Halen on their ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' tour. The band rose to prominence opening for Van Halen, ultimately playing 48 shows, an act of distinction for an unsigned band. Due to their rising popularity, Autograph soon signed a contract with [[RCA Records]] following a performance at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in late 1984.\n\nAutograph's debut album, ''[[Sign In Please]]'', was completed and released in October, but did not make an appearance on any record charts until January 1985. The album contains the band's only major hit, and now signature song, \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\" The song itself was one of the last ones recorded for the album, and the band members were initially very lukewarm toward it. However, the tune would become a top-30 hit, pushing album sales past the [[gold album]] mark (500,000 copies sold). The song was featured in an episode of \"[[Miami Vice]]\" (entitled \"Little Prince\") and was also leased out to numerous other films, even further elevating the song's popularity. Lynch's guitar work in \"Turn Up The Radio\", featuring a distinctive two-handed, fretboard-tapping technique, won him the \"Guitar Solo of the Year\" award from [[Guitar Player]] magazine in 1985.\n\n\"Send Her to Me\" was released as a follow-up single, though its success paled in comparison to the massive first hit.  Other songs from the ''Sign in Please'' album, \"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend Isn't Me\" and \"Deep End,\" along with \"Take No Prisoners,\" which would soon appear on the band's follow-up album, and were featured in the 1985 film ''[[Secret Admirer]],'' starring [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Corey Haim]], [[Lori Loughlin]] and [[Casey Siemaszko]]. The 1985 film ''[[Fright Night]]'' also included a song the band recorded titled \"You Can't Hide From the Beast Inside\".\n\nA second album, ''[[That's the Stuff]]'', was quickly recorded and released in the fall of 1985, and the group went on tour in support of several other bands, including [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Heart (band)|Heart]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Although record sales were disappointing in comparison to their first album, it still achieved near gold status. Supported by the single, \"Blondes in Black Cars\" and the title track, a minor-hit, it eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;92 on the Billboard album charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=autograph|chart=Billboard 200}} Autograph- album chart positions @Billboard.com] Retrieved 1-1-2012.</ref>  The band then recorded a song titled \"Winning Is Everything\" for the film ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]''.\n\nAutograph recorded a third album, which took longer to record than the other two combined and ''[[Loud and Clear (Autograph album)|Loud and Clear]]'' was released in the spring of 1987. The title song's music video featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Vince Neil]] of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] as extras. The band also made three appearances on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' in support of the album. In October, the band made a cameo in the film ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father, Like Son]]'', starring [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Kirk Cameron]]. The first song featured was \"Dance all Night,\" which played briefly, and then they performed the song \"She Never Looked That Good for Me\" for the film, appearing in a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as themselves. Despite all three of these songs being released as singles, the album was not a big success, mostly due to lackluster support from the label.\n\n===Leaving RCA and break up (1988\u20131989)===\nThe band left RCA Records in early 1988. Isham left the band to pursue other options but was not replaced, as the band felt they no longer needed keyboards and wanted to take a newer and heavier direction. The remaining members began recording a new album in 1988 which they hoped to release sometime the following year, but those plans never occurred due to lack of any type of label support.\n\nRichards also left the band around this time. However, in early 1989 the band toured with new drummer Eddie Cross and continued to sporadically record. The band would eventually be offered a new deal with [[Epic Records|Epic]] in 1989, which they declined.\n\nIn their short time they recorded three albums and toured with several famous bands, including [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Van Halen]], [[Bryan Adams]], and [[Whitesnake]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050205/http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|url-status=dead|title=Steve Lynch's Official Website|archivedate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> but in the end could not sustain their own career.\n\nDisappointed, the remaining members disbanded in December 1989.\n\n===Post break-up (1989\u20132013)===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2014}}\nThough the group had disbanded, a few of their music videos (most commonly \"Turn Up the Radio\") continued to be played on music video channels and programs such as [[MTV]]'s [[Headbangers Ball]] for several years after their initial debut. \n\n'''Steve Plunkett''' \u2013 When the original group disbanded in 1989, Plunkett became a staff writer and producer for All Nations Music, where he had over 170 of his songs released, including over 40 in movies like ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'', \"Brave New Girl\" (Britney Spears penned movie for ABC Family) and ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]''. Many artists have recorded his songs including [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]], [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Edgar Winter]].  He has also produced artists such as [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Graham Nash]] and [[En Vogue]].  He wrote and performed the theme song for the WB television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', as well as several other theme songs for shows such as ''[[Summerland (TV series)|Summerland]]'', ''Kojak'', and ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' which featured \"Behind the Mask\" performed by [[Jose Feliciano]]. Plunkett has had his original songs in hundreds of TV shows such as ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]].''\n\n'''Steve Lynch''' \u2013 The original lead guitarist has been a guitar teacher for several years, schooling students in his virtuosic signature 8-finger \"hammer-on\" guitar technique. He has also published several books on his guitar styles as well as an instructional video that has been a top seller worldwide. He has conducted 325 'guitar clinics' in 18 countries. He eventually formed another band named Network 23 and the album by the same name was released in 2004. He currently owns a music school in the Seattle area and completed a new teaching website called lynchlicks.com that went online in 2009.\n\n'''Randy Rand''' \u2013 The former bassist began a career in leather-making, establishing an international importing/exporting shop that sells his own hand-crafted leather products,  and even working with [[Harley Davidson]] for a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pp.auto.ke.orange.fr/|title=Orange|website=Pp.auto.ke.orange.fr}}</ref> According to Autograph's now-defunct \"Turn Up the Web!\" website, he has a daughter named Sterling Knight who has become a relatively well-known model in Italy.\n\n'''Keni Richards''' \u2013 The drummer went on to work with the band [[Dirty White Boy (band)|Dirty White Boy]], but later left the music business due to a chronic back problem he has had for several years. Nevertheless, he continued his passion for music and art, publicly saying he has no regrets. He also involved himself in songwriting and producing duties even after the band broke up and continued it even after band's reformation, wherein he participated for a short period of time. Richards died on April 8, 2017, reportedly in a drug-related homicide.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://sleazeroxx.com/ex-autograph-drummer-keni-richards-murdered-homicide-investigation-pending/|title=Ex-Autograph drummer Keni Richards murdered \u2014 homicide investigation pending |website=Sleazeroxx.com|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Steven Isham''' \u2013 The keyboardist joined up with [[Gary Moon]], who later replaced [[Jack Blades]] in the band [[Night Ranger]], to form The Pack, and he later went on to tour as the drummer for [[Vince Neil]]'s solo act. Remaining active in the music business throughout the ensuing years, Isham died on December 9, 2008, at the age of 56 from [[liver cancer]].\n\n'''Eddie Cross''' \u2013 The drummer of the Los Angeles band, Hot Wheelz, joined Autograph and played on its 1989 tour and the new tracks on the ''Missing Pieces'' CD.  He was later a member several other L.A. bands, including Bad Boys (with former members of [[Quiet Riot]]), Vigilante Man (with [[Guns N' Roses]] co-writer West Arkeen) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (who later joined Guns N' Roses).  In 1991, Cross went to law school in [[Orange County, California]], and has been President of Law Offices of Edward H. Cross & Associates, PC since 1995.  The firm opened in Santa Ana, California, relocated to Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i in 2004 and finally landed in Palm Desert, California, in 2005, where he practices construction and real estate law.  He has a daughter and a son and is a world traveler and an avid photographer.\n\n===Reunion (2013\u2013present)===\nIn late 2013, original members Steve Lynch, Randy Rand, and Keni Richards got back together for a reunion. Due to Plunkett not being interested in doing the reunion, they have replaced him with Jailhouse, Flood, 1RKO, solo artist singer/songwriter/guitarist Simon Daniels. The band has an interview in [[Guitar World]] Magazine, a review in Classic Rock and Fireworks magazines.\n\nSince 2014, by which time Richards had been replaced by Mark Wieland on drums, the band has played the Monsters of Rock Cruise, M3 Rock Festival, The Moondance Jam, The Halfway Jam, Firefest UK, Rockin the Rivers, The Iowa State Fair along with other festivals, theaters and worldwide touring.\n\nOn January 15, 2015, they released their first single, \"You Are Us, We Are You,\" on [[iTunes]]. On April 21, they released their 2nd single, \"I Lost My Mind in America,\" which made the Top 10 download of the charts. In July, the band was featured in [[USA Today NEWS]] after playing the famous Halfway Jam Rock Festival. On September 23, the band released their 3rd single \"Every Generation\" and is featured as track of the week on [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] Magazine.\n\nOn January 7, 2016, the new 5 song EP ''Louder'', with 4 original new singles and a live version of \"Turn up the Radio\", was released and is available on the official website.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, the band completed the recordings for the new full album which will be announced and released this year In March, the band had already toured the Midwest and Northeast US again, with shows in the UK and Germany and is booked solid for the rest of the year.\n\nOn April 8, 2017, Keni Richards died at the age of 60. The cause of his death appears to be a drug-related homicide.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn July 29, 2017, the band signed with [[EMP Label Group]] owned by David Ellefson of Megadeth and have announced a new album titled ''Get Off Your Ass'', which was released on October 6, with a limited-edition vinyl LP. The Album hit # 21 on the Billboard Classic Rock Sales Chart with 2 singles on the Top 10 on the Hard Rock Media base Radio Chart. Extensive Touring followed the release.

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S. Gilbert, Nicolae Panin and Pavel M. Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic languages]] in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|url-status=live|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant.

The old Syrian period was dominated by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite first kingdom]] (3000 BC - 2300 BC), [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Kingdom of Nagar]] (2600 BC - 2300 BC) and the [[Mari, Syria#The second kingdom|Mariote second kingdom]] (2500 BC - 2290 BC). The [[Akkadian Empire]] conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the [[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], ca. 2000\u20131600&nbsp;BC, which arose in [[Mari, Syria#The Lim dynasty|Mari]], [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]]. The Amorites also founded [[Babylon]] in Mesopotamia. Also following the Akkadians was the extension of Khirbet Kerak ware culture, showing affinities with the [[Caucasus]], and possibly linked to the later appearance of the [[Hurrians]].\n\nAround the 17th and 16th centuries&nbsp;BC most of the older centers had been overrun. The [[Mitanni]], for a time, menaced the Hittite kingdom, but were defeated by it around the middle of the 14th. The Semitic [[Hyksos]] used the new technologies to occupy Egypt, but were expelled, leaving the empire of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to develop in their wake. From 1550 until 1100, much of the Levant was conquered by Egypt, which in the latter half of this period contested Syria with the Hittite Empire.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century&nbsp;BC, all of these powers suddenly collapsed. Cities all around the eastern Mediterranean were sacked within a span of a few decades by assorted raiders. The Hittite empire was destroyed. Egypt repelled its attackers with only a major effort, and over the next century shrank to its territorial core, its central authority permanently weakened. Multiple cities on the Coast like [[Ugarit]] and other Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea People.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse|destruction at the end of the Bronze Age]] left a number of tiny kingdoms and city-states behind. A few [[Hittites|Hittite]] centres remained in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] known as the [[Syro-Hittite states]], along with some [[Phoenicia]]n ports in [[Canaan]] that escaped destruction and developed into great commercial powers. The [[Israelites]] emerged as a rural culture (possibly from the displaced Canaanite refugees escaping the Bronze Age Collapse to [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] alongside groups like the [[Shasu]] and the [[Habiru]]) mainly in the Canaanite hill-country and the Eastern Galilee, quickly spreading through the land and forming an alliance in the struggle for the land against the Philistines to the West, [[Moab]] and [[Ammon]] to the East and [[Edom]] to the South. In the 12th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, most of the interior, as well as [[Babylonia]], was overrun by [[Aramaeans|Arameans]], while the shoreline around today's [[Gaza Strip]] was settled by [[Philistines]]. At this time the Chaldeans (in different waves of people) had left the Levant for Mesopotamia and established the [[Neo-Babylonian empire]] from which [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] came from. \n\nIn this period a number of technological innovations spread, most notably iron working and the [[Phoenician alphabet]], developed by the Phoenicians or the Canaanites around the 16th century&nbsp;BC.\n\nDuring the 9th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] began to reassert themselves against the incursions of the Aramaeans, and over the next few centuries developed into a powerful and well-organised empire. Their armies were among the first to employ cavalry, which took the place of chariots, and had a reputation for both prowess and brutality. At their height, the Assyrians dominated all of the Levant, Egypt, and Babylonia. However, the empire began to collapse toward the end of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, and was obliterated by an alliance between a resurgent [[New Kingdom of Babylonia]] and the Iranian [[Medes]].\n\nThe subsequent balance of power was short-lived, though. In the 550s&nbsp;BC the [[Persian people|Persians]] revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, and over the next few decades annexed to it the realms of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]], [[Damascus]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Egypt]], as well as consolidating their control over the Iranian plateau nearly as far as [[India]]. This vast kingdom was divided up into various [[satrap]]ies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Around this time [[Zoroastrianism]] became the predominant religion in [[Iran|Persia]].\n\n==Classical Age==\n[[Iran|Persia]] controlled the Levant, but by the 4th century&nbsp;BC Persia had fallen into decline. The Phoenicians on the coast started many unsuccessful rebellions against the Persians who taxed them a lot, while the Jews were more relaxed under the Persian rule especially after the return from the exile that Cyrus the Great granted them. [[Ten Thousand|The campaigns]] of [[Xenophon]] in 401-399 BC illustrated how very vulnerable Persia had become to armies organized along [[ancient Greece|Greek]] lines. Such an army under the Macedonian King [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the Levant (333-332 BC).\n\nAlexander did not live long enough to consolidate his realm; after his death in 323 BC the greater share of the east eventually went to [[Seleucid Empire|the descendants]] of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. This period saw great innovations in mathematics, science, architecture, and the like, and Greeks founded cities throughout the east, some of which grew to be the world's first major metropolises.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Hellenistic culture]] did not, however, reach very far into the countryside. The Seleucids brought lots of Greeks, in addition to the descendants of the soldiers who served in the army of Alexander, from Greek cities to populate new cities founded all over the Levant.\n\nThe [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] (312 to 63 BC) adopted a pro-western stance that alienated both the powerful eastern satraps and many Greeks who had migrated to the east. During the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Greek culture lost ground in the Levant, and the Seleucid Empire began to break apart. The Seleucid decline continued, and the [[Roman Republic]] overran the Seleucid heartland in 65&nbsp;BC. Judea, which [[Maccabean Revolt|had become independent]] under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] (140 BC - 37 BC), was annexed by Rome in 63&nbsp;BC and became [[Iudaea Province]] (6 - 135 AD), the period became notable for when the Jewish population was expelled from Jerusalem after the destruction of the second Temple c. 70 AD and dispersed all over the old world. Five Roman legions were placed in the Levant proper for a couple of centuries until they eventually fade from historical records in the start of the 5th century. \n\nA Persian dynasty, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] (224-651), periodically clashed with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and later with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 391 the Byzantine era began with the permanent division of the Roman Empire into Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves. Byzantine control over many parts of the Levant lasted until 636, when [[Arabs|Arab]] armies [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the area]] and it became a part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].\n\nThe [[Byzantium|Byzantines]] reached a low point under [[Phocas]] ([[Byzantine Emperor]] from 602 to 610), with the Sassanids occupying the whole of the eastern Mediterranean. In 610, though, [[Heraclius]] took the throne in [[Constantinople]] and began a successful counter-attack, expelling the [[Persian people|Persians]] and invading [[Medes|Media]] and [[Assyria]]. Unable to stop his advance, the Sassanian king [[Khosrau II]] was assassinated (628) and the Sassanid empire fell into anarchy. Weakened by their quarrels, neither the Byzantines nor the Sassanids could deal with the onslaught of the [[Arabs]], newly unified under the banners of [[Islam]] and keen to expand their area of control. By 650 [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab forces had conquered]] all of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], and [[Upper Egypt|Egypt]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Near East]]\n* [[History of the Northern Levant]]\n** [[History of Cyprus]]\n* [[History of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of Israel]] \n** [[History of Palestine (region)]]\n** [[History of the Southeastern Levant]]\n** [[Pre-history of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n** [[History of the Sinai Peninsula]]\n*[[History of Islam]]\n*[[History of the Middle East]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Philip Mansel, ''Levant: Splendour and Catastrophe on the Mediterranean'', London, John Murray, 11 November 2010, hardback, 480 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6707-0}}, New Haven, Yale University Press, 24 May 2011, hardback, 470 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-300-17264-5}}\n\n{{Commons category|History of the Levant}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Levant.html The History of the Ancient Near East]\n\n{{Ancient states and regions of the Levant}}\n{{Prehistoric Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Levant}}\n[[Category:Ancient Levant| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|History of the [[Levant]]|what the area is called by natives and others|Names of the Levant|region's history|History of the Middle East}}\n{{Short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2015}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Levant - Satellite.png|thumb|300x300px|The Levant]] -->\nThe [[Levant]] is the large area in [[Southwest Asia]], south of the [[Taurus Mountains]], bounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, the [[Arabian Desert]] in the south, and [[Mesopotamia]] in the east.

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S. Gilbert, Nicolae Panin and Pavel M. Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic languages]] in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|url-status=live|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant.

The three versions included two [[forced induction]] [[Inline-four engine|inline&#8209;four]] [[GM Ecotec engine#Ecotec|Ecotec]] engines and a third [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] engine that was later called the '''Cobalt&nbsp;Sport'''. SS is an abbreviation of [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]], a historic moniker used by [[Chevrolet]] to denote high performance upgrades that meet certain criteria.\n\nThe Cobalt&nbsp;SS was GM's first foray into the [[Tuner (car)|tuner]] market, launching with a {{cvt|205|hp|kW PS|0}} [[supercharger|supercharged]] 2.0&nbsp;L engine in late 2004 as a 2005 model, paired only with the [[F35 (MU3) transmission|F35]] [[Manual transmission|manual]] transmission of [[Opel]]. The following year, a naturally aspirated 1SS model equipped with GM's new 2.4&nbsp;L {{cvt|171|hp|kW PS|0}} engine was added; it had both automatic and manual transmission options. Production of the supercharged version continued until 2007; after a brief hiatus the SS relaunched in the second quarter of 2008 with a more economical and powerful [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 2.0&nbsp;L engine producing {{cvt|260|hp|kW PS|0}} before all Cobalt production ended in 2010. ''([[#timeline|See timeline]])''.\n\nThe Cobalt&nbsp;SS received generally positive reviews, particularly the turbocharged and supercharged versions. In a 2013 review, journalist Patrick George called it the best compact car ever made by General Motors, and a potential \"future classic\".<ref name=classic/> At first release in 2004, the supercharged version was praised for its performance but drew criticism for its interior quality and exterior styling, both described as too reminiscent of its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]. Reports surfaced in May&nbsp;2009 that General Motors planned to eliminate the Cobalt&nbsp;SS as early as December&nbsp;2009, but they proved to be untrue.<ref name=dead/><ref name=kills/> Production continued but ordering options for late 2010 models were limited and production of all Cobalts ended in June&nbsp;2010. The car was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]],<ref name=Priddle/> but a high performance version comparable to the Cobalt&nbsp;SS was never announced and the Cruze ended production for the North American market in 2019.<ref>{{cite web | title=GM announces $350 million for Lordstown plant to {{sic|nolink=y|bulid}} Chevy Cruze | work=[[Autoblog.com]] | date=2008-08-21 | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/21/gm-announces-350-million-for-lordstown-plant-to-bulid-chevy-cru/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727110042/http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/21/gm-announces-350-million-for-lordstown-plant-to-bulid-chevy-cru | archivedate=July 27, 2009 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all | accessdate=2008-10-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Model details==\n===Overview===\nGeneral Motors used five different inline-four engines in the Cobalt over the course of production, and designated three as SS models.  The first was launched in 2004 as a 2005 model with a new powertrain that had debuted one year earlier on the [[Saturn Ion|Saturn ION Red&nbsp;Line]]. It was available as a Supercharged coupe only. The [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 2.4&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|LE5]] engine was the next SS to launch in late 2005 as a 2006 model, available as both a coupe and sedan for the duration of its run.<ref name = six/><ref name=ed8/> However, in late 2007, at the same time the announcement cancelling the SS Supercharged was made, GM also announced that the 2.4&nbsp;L would be renamed \"Cobalt&nbsp;Sport\", rendering Chevrolet without a Cobalt&nbsp;SS for the first half of the 2008 model year. The 2.0&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LNF|LNF]] turbocharged Cobalt was the last to launch in the second quarter of 2008.  It was initially available only as a coupe until a sedan option was offered for the 2009 model year but again deleted for 2010 after less than 500 were produced.<ref name=color/>\n\nAll three models of the Cobalt&nbsp;SS feature four wheel, [[Anti-lock braking system|anti&#8209;lock]] [[disc brake]]s. Compared to the base Cobalt, the SS has lower front and rear fascias for a more aggressive look with integrated [[Automotive lighting#Front fog lamps|fog lights]], side rocker moldings, interior accents, and a chrome exhaust tip. Exclusive to the 2.0&nbsp;L Cobalt are a titanium\u2011faced sport analogue cluster with a 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h in Canada) [[speedometer]], an A\u2011pillar mounted boost gauge, reclining front bucket seats with two\u2011tone leather\u2011appointed seating surfaces, vertical adjusting head restraints and driver\u2011side lumbar and height adjusters, and a sport\u2011tuned FE5 suspension with a 24&nbsp;mm front stabilizer bar and 22&nbsp;mm rear stabilizer bar.<ref name = six/>\n\n===SS Supercharged===\n[[File:Cobalt SS Supercharged.jpg|thumb|SS Supercharged racing]]\nAvailable as a coupe only, the SS&nbsp;Supercharged featured the 2.0&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LSJ|LSJ]] Ecotec engine with an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] M62 [[Roots type supercharger]] and air\u2011to\u2011liquid [[intercooler]].<ref name=bw/>  The engine makes {{cvt|205|hp|kW|0}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm and {{cvt|200|lbft|Nm|0}} at 4,400&nbsp;rpm.<ref name = six/> 18\u2011inch broad spoke wheels with P215/45R18 summer [[Pirelli]] tires were standard. Optional for the LSJ was a performance package coded G85 that added [[Recaro]] bucket seats and a [[limited slip differential]] (LSD). LSD was optional for 2005 models (performance package came with LSD) and was standard in models from 2007 to 2010. The G85 option continued in the LNF Cobalt, but added only the LSD. The car became notable for a high\u2011profile spoiler that was standard in 2005, but optional from 2008 when a lower profile spoiler used on all other Cobalt coupes became an option.<ref name = seven>{{cite web | title = 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt  | publisher=General Motors | url = http://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_cobalt/07index.html |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114040220/https://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_cobalt/07index.html |archivedate=2016-01-14 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGM offered dealer-installed performance upgrade packages called \"stage kits\" that were covered by factory warranty.<ref name=stg>{{cite web| title = Cobalt Stage Kits & Stage Kit Accessories|url=http://www.crateenginedepot.com/Cobalt-Stage-Kits-Stage-Kit-Accessories-C690.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416055002/http://www.crateenginedepot.com/Cobalt-Stage-Kits-Stage-Kit-Accessories-C690.aspx |archivedate=2016-04-16 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live |work=Crate Engine Depot}}</ref>\nThe Stage&nbsp;1 kit consists of new fuel injectors and a reprogram of the [[Engine control unit|ECU]], and yields up to a {{cvt|30|hp|kW}} improvement.

However, the general fit and finish was poor, and power levels were not up to par with other competitors.

The three versions included two [[forced induction]] [[Inline-four engine|inline&#8209;four]] [[GM Ecotec engine#Ecotec|Ecotec]] engines and a third [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] engine that was later called the '''Cobalt&nbsp;Sport'''. SS is an abbreviation of [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]], a historic moniker used by [[Chevrolet]] to denote high performance upgrades that meet certain criteria.\n\nThe Cobalt&nbsp;SS was GM's first foray into the [[Tuner (car)|tuner]] market, launching with a {{cvt|205|hp|kW PS|0}} [[supercharger|supercharged]] 2.0&nbsp;L engine in late 2004 as a 2005 model, paired only with the [[F35 (MU3) transmission|F35]] [[Manual transmission|manual]] transmission of [[Opel]]. The following year, a naturally aspirated 1SS model equipped with GM's new 2.4&nbsp;L {{cvt|171|hp|kW PS|0}} engine was added; it had both automatic and manual transmission options. Production of the supercharged version continued until 2007; after a brief hiatus the SS relaunched in the second quarter of 2008 with a more economical and powerful [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 2.0&nbsp;L engine producing {{cvt|260|hp|kW PS|0}} before all Cobalt production ended in 2010. ''([[#timeline|See timeline]])''.\n\nThe Cobalt&nbsp;SS received generally positive reviews, particularly the turbocharged and supercharged versions. In a 2013 review, journalist Patrick George called it the best compact car ever made by General Motors, and a potential \"future classic\".<ref name=classic/> At first release in 2004, the supercharged version was praised for its performance but drew criticism for its interior quality and exterior styling, both described as too reminiscent of its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]. Reports surfaced in May&nbsp;2009 that General Motors planned to eliminate the Cobalt&nbsp;SS as early as December&nbsp;2009, but they proved to be untrue.<ref name=dead/><ref name=kills/> Production continued but ordering options for late 2010 models were limited and production of all Cobalts ended in June&nbsp;2010. The car was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]],<ref name=Priddle/> but a high performance version comparable to the Cobalt&nbsp;SS was never announced and the Cruze ended production for the North American market in 2019.<ref>{{cite web | title=GM announces $350 million for Lordstown plant to {{sic|nolink=y|bulid}} Chevy Cruze | work=[[Autoblog.com]] | date=2008-08-21 | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/21/gm-announces-350-million-for-lordstown-plant-to-bulid-chevy-cru/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727110042/http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/21/gm-announces-350-million-for-lordstown-plant-to-bulid-chevy-cru | archivedate=July 27, 2009 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all | accessdate=2008-10-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Model details==\n===Overview===\nGeneral Motors used five different inline-four engines in the Cobalt over the course of production, and designated three as SS models.  The first was launched in 2004 as a 2005 model with a new powertrain that had debuted one year earlier on the [[Saturn Ion|Saturn ION Red&nbsp;Line]]. It was available as a Supercharged coupe only. The [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 2.4&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|LE5]] engine was the next SS to launch in late 2005 as a 2006 model, available as both a coupe and sedan for the duration of its run.<ref name = six/><ref name=ed8/> However, in late 2007, at the same time the announcement cancelling the SS Supercharged was made, GM also announced that the 2.4&nbsp;L would be renamed \"Cobalt&nbsp;Sport\", rendering Chevrolet without a Cobalt&nbsp;SS for the first half of the 2008 model year. The 2.0&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LNF|LNF]] turbocharged Cobalt was the last to launch in the second quarter of 2008.  It was initially available only as a coupe until a sedan option was offered for the 2009 model year but again deleted for 2010 after less than 500 were produced.<ref name=color/>\n\nAll three models of the Cobalt&nbsp;SS feature four wheel, [[Anti-lock braking system|anti&#8209;lock]] [[disc brake]]s. Compared to the base Cobalt, the SS has lower front and rear fascias for a more aggressive look with integrated [[Automotive lighting#Front fog lamps|fog lights]], side rocker moldings, interior accents, and a chrome exhaust tip. Exclusive to the 2.0&nbsp;L Cobalt are a titanium\u2011faced sport analogue cluster with a 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h in Canada) [[speedometer]], an A\u2011pillar mounted boost gauge, reclining front bucket seats with two\u2011tone leather\u2011appointed seating surfaces, vertical adjusting head restraints and driver\u2011side lumbar and height adjusters, and a sport\u2011tuned FE5 suspension with a 24&nbsp;mm front stabilizer bar and 22&nbsp;mm rear stabilizer bar.<ref name = six/>\n\n===SS Supercharged===\n[[File:Cobalt SS Supercharged.jpg|thumb|SS Supercharged racing]]\nAvailable as a coupe only, the SS&nbsp;Supercharged featured the 2.0&nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LSJ|LSJ]] Ecotec engine with an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] M62 [[Roots type supercharger]] and air\u2011to\u2011liquid [[intercooler]].<ref name=bw/>  The engine makes {{cvt|205|hp|kW|0}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm and {{cvt|200|lbft|Nm|0}} at 4,400&nbsp;rpm.<ref name = six/> 18\u2011inch broad spoke wheels with P215/45R18 summer [[Pirelli]] tires were standard. Optional for the LSJ was a performance package coded G85 that added [[Recaro]] bucket seats and a [[limited slip differential]] (LSD). LSD was optional for 2005 models (performance package came with LSD) and was standard in models from 2007 to 2010. The G85 option continued in the LNF Cobalt, but added only the LSD. The car became notable for a high\u2011profile spoiler that was standard in 2005, but optional from 2008 when a lower profile spoiler used on all other Cobalt coupes became an option.<ref name = seven>{{cite web | title = 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt  | publisher=General Motors | url = http://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_cobalt/07index.html |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114040220/https://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_cobalt/07index.html |archivedate=2016-01-14 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGM offered dealer-installed performance upgrade packages called \"stage kits\" that were covered by factory warranty.<ref name=stg>{{cite web| title = Cobalt Stage Kits & Stage Kit Accessories|url=http://www.crateenginedepot.com/Cobalt-Stage-Kits-Stage-Kit-Accessories-C690.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416055002/http://www.crateenginedepot.com/Cobalt-Stage-Kits-Stage-Kit-Accessories-C690.aspx |archivedate=2016-04-16 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live |work=Crate Engine Depot}}</ref>\nThe Stage&nbsp;1 kit consists of new fuel injectors and a reprogram of the [[Engine control unit|ECU]], and yields up to a {{cvt|30|hp|kW}} improvement.

John Neff of ''Autoblog'' said, \"The GM Performance Division completely reworked the Cobalt&nbsp;SS for 2008, swapping in a more powerful turbocharged engine, upgrading the rest of the mechanicals, and tweaking the entire package on the world's most demanding race tracks, including the famed N\u00fcrburgring in Germany.

He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed [[free software]]. Stallman launched the [[GNU Project]], founded the [[Free Software Foundation]], developed the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU Emacs]], and wrote the [[GNU General Public License]].\n\nStallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] composed entirely of free software.<ref name=\"initialgnu\"/> With this, he also launched the [[free software movement]]. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection,<ref name=\"gcc-contribs\"/> [[GNU Debugger]],<ref name=\"RIT\"/> and GNU Emacs text editor.<ref name=\"multic\"/> In October 1985<ref name=\"fsfbio\"/> he founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

When MIT's [[Project MAC|Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20 percent of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed.

To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing [[source code]] and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such [[proprietary software]] had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software was a consequence triggered by the US [[Copyright Act of 1976]].<ref name=\"Cringely\"/>\n\nWhen [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] in 1979 placed [[Time bomb (software)|time bombs]] in the [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]] markup language and word processing system to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it \"a crime against humanity\".<ref name=\"emac6\"/> During an interview in 2008, he clarified that it is blocking the user's freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for software.<ref name=\"unplugged\"/> Stallman's [[texinfo]] is a [[GPL]] replacement, loosely based on Scribe;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo |title=Texinfo \u2013 GNU Documentation System \u2013 GNU Project \u2013 Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Gnu.org |date=February 19, 2015 |access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref> the original version was finished in 1986.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt Gnu Status], by Richard M.

Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's need to be able to freely modify the software they use.<ref name=\"freeasinfreedom-Chap1\"/>\n\n[[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]], a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded [[Lisp Machines|Lisp Machines, Inc.]] (LMI) to market [[Lisp machine]]s, which he and [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]] designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the [[venture capital]]-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded [[Symbolics]], with the aid of [[Russ Noftsker]], an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker [[Bill Gosper]], who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics also forced Greenblatt to resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab's community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers.<ref name=\"Levy\"/>\n\nStallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbors and be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical.<ref name=OpenSources/> The phrase \"software wants to be free\" is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy.<ref name=\"Salus\"/> He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral ''value'', and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html |title=Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism |publisher=Gnu.org |access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref> [[Eric S.

Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization founded in [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"DuBois\"/> Stallman popularized the concept of ''copyleft'', a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.\n\nStallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a [[text editor]] ([[Emacs]]), [[compiler]] ([[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]), [[debugger]] ([[GNU Debugger]]), and a [[build automation|build automator]] ([[GNU make]]). The notable omission was a [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. In 1990, members of the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon's Mach [[microkernel]] in a project called [[GNU Hurd]], which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for full POSIX compliance.\n\nIn 1991, [[Linus Torvalds]], a [[Finns|Finnish]] student, used the GNU's development tools to produce the free [[monolithic kernel|monolithic]] [[Linux kernel]]. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name ''[[Linux]]'' to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it ''GNU/Linux''. This has been a longstanding [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|naming controversy]] in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.\n\n[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman.jpeg|thumb|Cover picture for [[O'Reilly Media]]'s book ''[[Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|Free as in Freedom]]'']]\nStallman's influences on hacker culture include the name [[POSIX]]<ref name=\"PE\"/> and the [[Emacs]] editor. On [[Unix]] systems, GNU Emacs's popularity rivaled that of another editor [[vi]], spawning an [[editor war]]. Stallman's take on this was to [[Canonization|canonize]] himself as St. IGNUcius of the [[Church of Emacs]]<ref name=\"Takver\"/><ref name=\"Church\"/> and acknowledge that \"vi vi vi is the [[Number of the Beast|editor of the beast]]\", while \"using a free version of vi is not a [[sin]]; it is a [[penance]]\".<ref name=\"faif\"/> On his homepage Stallman explains what a life in the Church of Emacs means to its members: \"Sainthood in the Church of Emacs requires living a life of purity\u2014but in the Church of Emacs, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard)\".<ref name=\"Church\"/>\n\nIn 1992, developers at [[Lucid Inc.]] doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately [[fork (software engineering)|forked]] the software into what would become [[XEmacs]].<ref name=\"lemacs\"/> The technology journalist [[Andrew Leonard]] has characterized what he sees as Stallman's uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers:\n{{quote|There's something comforting about Stallman's intransigence.

He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on [[cubic root]]s of their popularity to ensure that \"fairly successful non-stars\" receive a greater share than they do now (compare with [[private copying levy]] which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous [[micropayment]] system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies should be considered a copyright violation.<ref name=\"tech-help-share\">{{cite web\n |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/17/sharing-ebooks-richard-stallman\n |title=Technology should help us share, not constrain us\n |last=Stallman |first=Richard\n |date=April 17, 2012\n |publisher=The Guardian: [[Guardian News and Media Limited]]\n}}</ref><ref name=\"elpais-leysinde\">{{cite news\n |url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2011/06/08/actualidad/1307484020_850215.html\n |title=La 'ley Sinde' es tan injusta que deber\u00eda ser desobedecida\n |last=Mora |first=Miguel\n |work=[[El Pa\u00eds]]\n |publisher=Ediciones El Pa\u00eds, S.L.\n |language=es\n |date=June 8, 2011\n |access-date=April 1, 2013\n}}</ref> He has advocated [[civil disobedience]] in a comment on [[Ley Sinde]].<ref name=\"elpais-leysinde\"/><ref name=\"dontobey\">{{cite web |author= |url=http://torrentfreak.com/richard-stallman-opts-to-disobey-anti-piracy-law-110610/ |title=Richard Stallman Opts to Disobey Anti-Piracy Law |publisher=TorrentFreak.com |date=June 10, 2011 |access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nStallman has also helped and supported the [[International Music Score Library Project]] in getting back online, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007, following a [[cease and desist]] letter from [[Universal Edition]].<ref name=\"IMSLP\"/>\n\n[[File:Richard M Stallman Swathanthra 2014 kerala.jpg|thumb|left|Stallman at [[Swatantra 2014]], a conference organized by [[ICFOSS]] in Kerala, India]]\nStallman mentions the dangers some [[e-books]] bring compared to paper books, with the example of the [[Amazon Kindle]] [[e-reader]] that prevents the copying of e-books and allows Amazon to order automatic deletion of a book. He says that such e-books present a big step backward with respect to paper books by being less easy to use, copy, lend to others or sell, also mentioning that Amazon e-books cannot be bought anonymously. His short story \"[[The Right to Read]]\" provides a picture of a dystopian future if the right to share books is impeded.

He asks people to say ''free software'' and ''GNU/Linux'', and to avoid the terms ''intellectual property'' and ''[[Copyright infringement of software|piracy]]'' (in relation to copying not approved by the publisher). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agrees to use his terminology throughout the article.<ref name=\"wired\"/> He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.<ref name=\"linux gnu\"/>\n\nStallman argues that the term ''intellectual property'' is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of [[copyright]], [[patent]], [[trademark]], and other areas of law by lumping together things that are more dissimilar than similar.<ref name=\"torino\"/> He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues, writing:\n{{quote|These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas \u2013 a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.<ref name=\"mirage\"/>}}\n\nAn example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list:\n{{quote|I think it is ok for authors (please let's not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let's not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).<ref name=\"athens\"/>}}\n\n=== Rejections ===\n==== Open source for free software ====\nHis requests that people use certain terms, and his ongoing efforts to convince people of the importance of terminology, are a source of regular misunderstanding and friction with parts of the free software and [[open-source community|open-source communities]].\n\nAfter initially accepting the concept,<ref>{{cite web |last=Tiemann |first=Michael |title=History of the OSI |publisher=Open Source Initiative |access-date=April 16, 2014 |url=http://www.opensource.org/history |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412040818/http://opensource.org/history |archive-date=April 12, 2014}}</ref> Stallman rejects a common [[alternative terms for free software|alternative term]], ''[[open-source software]]'', because it does not call to mind what Stallman sees as the value of the software: [[freedom (political)|freedom]].<ref name=\"free-open\"/> He wrote, \"Free software is a political movement; open source is a development model.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Open |title=Words to Avoid (or Use with Care) Because They Are Loaded or Confusing |publisher=Free Software Foundation |access-date=July 17, 2014}}</ref> Thus, he believes that the use of the term will not inform people of the freedom issues, and will not lead to people valuing and defending their freedom.<ref name=\"why-open\"/> Two alternatives which Stallman does accept are ''software libre'' and ''unfettered software'', but ''free software'' is the term he asks people to use in English. For similar reasons, he argues for the term ''[[proprietary software]]'' rather than ''[[closed-source software]]'', when referring to software that is not free software.\n\n==== Linux for the GNU Project ====\n{{main|GNU/Linux naming controversy}}\nStallman asks that the term ''GNU/Linux'', which he pronounces {{IPAc-en|\u0261|n|u\u02d0|_|s|l|\u00e6|\u0283|_|\u02c8|l|\u026a|n|\u0259|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|SLASH|_|LIN|\u0259ks}}, be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the kernel Linux. Stallman refers to this operating system as \"a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer\".<ref name=\"linux gnu\"/> He claims that the connection between the GNU project's philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux.<ref name=\"in-a-name\"/>  Starting around 2003, he began also using the term ''GNU+Linux'', which he pronounces {{IPAc-en|\u0261|n|u\u02d0|_|p|l|\u028c|s|_|\u02c8|l|\u026a|n|\u0259|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|PLUS|_|LIN|\u0259ks}}, to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase ''GNU/Linux'' as {{IPAc-en|\u0261|n|u\u02d0|_|\u02c8|l|\u026a|n|\u0259|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|LIN|\u0259ks}}, which would erroneously imply that the kernel Linux is maintained by the GNU project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-kernel-trap-interview.en.html |title=Interview with Richard Stallman, KernelTrap.org, 2005 |last=Andrews |first=Jeremy |publisher=GNU |year=2005 |access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> The creator of Linux, [[Linus Torvalds]], has publicly stated that he objects to modification of the name, and that the rename \"is their [the [[Free software foundation|FSF]]] confusion not ours\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |title=LKML: Linus Torvalds: Re: GPLv3 Position Statement |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/25/161 |website=lkml.org |publisher=Linux Kernel Mailing List |access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"black-and-white\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nStallman resides in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"Lifestyle\"/> He speaks English, French, Spanish and some Indonesian.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" /> He has said that he is \"an atheist of [[Jewish]] ancestry\"<ref name=\"stallman-jewish-source-1\"/> and often wears a button that reads \"Impeach God\".<ref name=\"freeasinfreedom-chap4\"/><ref name=\"Proulx\"/> He is openly [[childfree]].{{r|Stallman, Why It Is (2012)}}\n\nStallman refers to mobile phones as \"portable surveillance and [[Mobile phone tracking|tracking devices]]\",<ref name=\"gpl3-22june\"/> refusing to own a cell phone due to the lack of phones running entirely on free software.<ref name=\"infoweek\"/> He also avoids using a key card to enter his office building<ref name=\"shaggygod\"/> since key card systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, with the exception of a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb's grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites: the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, and then the script emails the user the web page content.<ref name=\"stallman-computing\"/><ref name=\"strawmen\"/> More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], except for [[Wikipedia]] (which generally disallows editing from Tor unless users have [[Wikipedia:IP block exemption|an IP block exemption]]).<ref name=\"SchuesslerInterview\"/><ref name=\"SchuesslerNewspaper\"/>\n\nStallman has written a collection of [[filk]] and parody songs, granting unlimited permission to sing and perform them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stallman.org/doggerel.html |title=Doggerel \u2013 Richard Stallman |website=www.stallman.org}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Abortion joke ===\nIn April, 2018, Stallman received criticism for electing to keep a [[Political correctness|non-politically correct]] joke about [[Abortion in the United States|American federal policies toward abortion]] in the documentation for [[glibc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/09/gnu_glic_abort_stallman/|title=You have GNU sense of humor!

16, 1953), often known by his initials, '''rms''',<ref name=\"initials\"/> and occasionally upper-case '''RMS''', is an American [[free software movement]] activist and [[programmer]]. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed [[free software]]. Stallman launched the [[GNU Project]], founded the [[Free Software Foundation]], developed the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU Emacs]], and wrote the [[GNU General Public License]].\n\nStallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] composed entirely of free software.<ref name=\"initialgnu\"/> With this, he also launched the [[free software movement]]. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection,<ref name=\"gcc-contribs\"/> [[GNU Debugger]],<ref name=\"RIT\"/> and GNU Emacs text editor.<ref name=\"multic\"/> In October 1985<ref name=\"fsfbio\"/> he founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In September 2019, he resigned as president of the FSF and left his \"visiting scientist\" role at MIT.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/computer-scientist-richard-stallman-resigns-from-mit-after-jeffrey-epstein-comments/|title=Computer scientist Richard Stallman resigns from MIT after Jeffrey Epstein comments|last=Musil|first=Steven|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=October 1, 2019}}</ref> Stallman remains head of the [[GNU Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Richard-Stallman-GNU-Head|title=Richard Stallman To Continue As Head Of The GNU Project}}</ref>\n\nStallman pioneered the concept of [[copyleft]], which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify, and distribute free software, and is the main author of [[free software license]]s which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.<ref name=\"wheeler\"/>\n\nIn 1989, he co-founded the [[League for Programming Freedom]]. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against [[software patent debate|software patents]], [[digital rights management]] (which he referred to as digital ''restrictions'' management, calling the more common term misleading), and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included [[End-user license agreement|software license agreements]], [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, [[Product activation|activation keys]], [[Software protection dongle|dongles]], [[Copy protection|copy restriction]], [[proprietary format]]s, and [[Binary file|binary]] [[executable]]s without [[source code]].\n\n== Early life ==\nStallman was born March 16, 1953,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stallman.org/biographies.html#serious |title=Biography |last=Stallman |first=Richard |website=stallman.org |access-date=April 13, 2019}}</ref> in [[New York City]], to a family of [[Jewish]] heritage.<ref name=\"stallman-jewish-source-1\"/> He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the [[IBM 7094]].<ref name=\"mgro\">{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Michael |title=Richard Stallman: High School Misfit, Symbol of Free Software, MacArthur-Certified Genius |url=http://mgross.com/writing/books/the-more-things-change/bonus-chapters/richard-stallman-high-school-misfit-symbol-of-free-software-macarthur-certified-genius/|work=The More Things Change |access-date=April 9, 2014|format=interview transcript |year=1999}}</ref> From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students.<ref name=\"mgro\"/> Stallman was also a volunteer laboratory assistant in the [[biology]] department at [[Rockefeller University]]. Although he was interested in mathematics and [[physics]], his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist.<ref name=\"freeasinfreedom-chap3\"/>\n\nHis first experience with actual computers was at the [[IBM New York Scientific Center]] when he was in high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in [[Fortran]].<ref name=\"mgro\" /> He completed the task after a couple of weeks (\"I swore that I would never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a language compared with other languages\") and spent the rest of the summer writing a text editor in [[APL (programming language)|APL]]<ref name=\"Ber\u00e4ttar\"/> and a [[preprocessor]] for the [[PL/I]] [[programming language]] on the [[IBM System/360]].<ref name=\"emac6\"/>\n\n=== Harvard University and MIT ===\nAs a first-year student at [[Harvard University]] in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in [[Math 55]].<ref name=\"freeasinfreedom-chap4\"/> He was happy: \"For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard.\"<ref name=\"mgro\"/>\n\nIn 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], and became a regular in the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community, where he was usually known by his initials, ''RMS'', which he used in his computer accounts.<ref name=\"initials\" /><ref name=\"The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih\">{{cite book |last=Lih |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=The Wikipedia Revolution |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-4013-0371-6 |oclc=232977686 |url=https://archive.org/details/wikipediarevolut00liha}}</ref> Stallman received a bachelor's degree in physics (''[[magna cum laude]]'') from Harvard in 1974.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web |last=Stallman |first=Richard |title=Serious Bio |url=https://www.stallman.org/biographies.html#serious |access-date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nStallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead decided to enroll as a graduate student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.<ref name=\"mgro\"/><ref name=\"emac6\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Sam |title=Free as in freedom : Richard Stallman's crusade for free software |date=2002 |publisher=O'Reilly|location=Beijing |isbn=0-596-00287-4|edition=2nd|chapter=Chapter 6 \u2013 The Emacs Commune |url=https://archive.org/details/freeasinfreedomr00will}}</ref>\n\nWhile working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under [[Gerald Jay Sussman|Gerry Sussman]],<ref name=\"emac6\"/> Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI [[truth maintenance system]], called ''dependency-directed backtracking''.<ref name=\"AI9\"/> This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s. {{As of|2009}}, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.<ref name=\"russell\"/> The technique of [[Constraint learning|constraint recording]], wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.<ref name=\"russell\" />\n\nAs a hacker in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as [[TECO (text editor)|TECO]] and [[Emacs]] for the [[Incompatible Timesharing System]] (ITS), as well as the [[Lisp machine]] operating system (the [[Lisp machine#Initial development|CONS]] of 1974\u20131976 and the CADR of 1977\u20131979\u2014this latter unit was commercialized by [[Symbolics]] and [[Lisp Machines]], Inc. (LMI) starting around 1980).<ref name=\"The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih\"/> He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). When MIT's [[Project MAC|Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20 percent of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.<ref name=\"Levy\"/>\n\nStallman resigned from MIT in 2019 after an email exchange related to [[Jeffrey Epstein]], [[Marvin Minsky]], and sexual assault of minors.<ref name=\"resign\">{{Cite web |title=Resignation |url=https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#16_September_2019_%28Resignation%29 |date=September 16, 2019 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |access-date=September 16, 2019 |quote=I am resigning effective immediately from my position in CSAIL at MIT.

To prevent software from being used on their competitors' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing [[source code]] and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such [[proprietary software]] had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software was a consequence triggered by the US [[Copyright Act of 1976]].<ref name=\"Cringely\"/>\n\nWhen [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]] in 1979 placed [[Time bomb (software)|time bombs]] in the [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]] markup language and word processing system to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it \"a crime against humanity\".<ref name=\"emac6\"/> During an interview in 2008, he clarified that it is blocking the user's freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for software.<ref name=\"unplugged\"/> Stallman's [[texinfo]] is a [[GPL]] replacement, loosely based on Scribe;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo |title=Texinfo \u2013 GNU Documentation System \u2013 GNU Project \u2013 Free Software Foundation (FSF) |publisher=Gnu.org |date=February 19, 2015 |access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref> the original version was finished in 1986.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt Gnu Status], by Richard M.

Stallman had modified the software for the Lab's previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person's job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people's need to be able to freely modify the software they use.<ref name=\"freeasinfreedom-Chap1\"/>\n\n[[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]], a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded [[Lisp Machines|Lisp Machines, Inc.]] (LMI) to market [[Lisp machine]]s, which he and [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]] designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the [[venture capital]]-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded [[Symbolics]], with the aid of [[Russ Noftsker]], an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker [[Bill Gosper]], who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics also forced Greenblatt to resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab's community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab's computers.<ref name=\"Levy\"/>\n\nStallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbors and be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical.<ref name=OpenSources/> The phrase \"software wants to be free\" is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy.<ref name=\"Salus\"/> He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral ''value'', and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html |title=Copyleft: Pragmatic Idealism |publisher=Gnu.org |access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref> [[Eric S.

So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it.\"<ref name=\"gnuproject\"/>\n\n[[File:Richard Stallman 00.jpg|thumb|left|Stallman in 2003 at the opening ceremony of NIXAL (a [[GNU/Linux User Group|GLUG]]) at [[Netaji Subhash Engineering College]], Calcutta, India]]\nIn 1985, Stallman published the [[GNU Manifesto]], which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with [[Unix]].<ref name=\"The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih\"/> The name GNU is a [[recursive acronym]] for \"GNU's Not Unix\".<ref name=\"The Wikipedia Revolution by Andrew Lih\"/> Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization founded in [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"DuBois\"/> Stallman popularized the concept of ''copyleft'', a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.\n\nStallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a [[text editor]] ([[Emacs]]), [[compiler]] ([[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]), [[debugger]] ([[GNU Debugger]]), and a [[build automation|build automator]] ([[GNU make]]). The notable omission was a [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. In 1990, members of the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon's Mach [[microkernel]] in a project called [[GNU Hurd]], which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for full POSIX compliance.\n\nIn 1991, [[Linus Torvalds]], a [[Finns|Finnish]] student, used the GNU's development tools to produce the free [[monolithic kernel|monolithic]] [[Linux kernel]]. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name ''[[Linux]]'' to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it ''GNU/Linux''. This has been a longstanding [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|naming controversy]] in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.\n\n[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman.jpeg|thumb|Cover picture for [[O'Reilly Media]]'s book ''[[Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software|Free as in Freedom]]'']]\nStallman's influences on hacker culture include the name [[POSIX]]<ref name=\"PE\"/> and the [[Emacs]] editor. On [[Unix]] systems, GNU Emacs's popularity rivaled that of another editor [[vi]], spawning an [[editor war]]. Stallman's take on this was to [[Canonization|canonize]] himself as St. IGNUcius of the [[Church of Emacs]]<ref name=\"Takver\"/><ref name=\"Church\"/> and acknowledge that \"vi vi vi is the [[Number of the Beast|editor of the beast]]\", while \"using a free version of vi is not a [[sin]]; it is a [[penance]]\".<ref name=\"faif\"/> On his homepage Stallman explains what a life in the Church of Emacs means to its members: \"Sainthood in the Church of Emacs requires living a life of purity\u2014but in the Church of Emacs, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard)\".<ref name=\"Church\"/>\n\nIn 1992, developers at [[Lucid Inc.]] doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately [[fork (software engineering)|forked]] the software into what would become [[XEmacs]].<ref name=\"lemacs\"/> The technology journalist [[Andrew Leonard]] has characterized what he sees as Stallman's uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers:\n{{quote|There's something comforting about Stallman's intransigence.

He asks people to say ''free software'' and ''GNU/Linux'', and to avoid the terms ''intellectual property'' and ''[[Copyright infringement of software|piracy]]'' (in relation to copying not approved by the publisher). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agrees to use his terminology throughout the article.<ref name=\"wired\"/> He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.<ref name=\"linux gnu\"/>\n\nStallman argues that the term ''intellectual property'' is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of [[copyright]], [[patent]], [[trademark]], and other areas of law by lumping together things that are more dissimilar than similar.<ref name=\"torino\"/> He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues, writing:\n{{quote|These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art.

For similar reasons, he argues for the term ''[[proprietary software]]'' rather than ''[[closed-source software]]'', when referring to software that is not free software.\n\n==== Linux for the GNU Project ====\n{{main|GNU/Linux naming controversy}}\nStallman asks that the term ''GNU/Linux'', which he pronounces {{IPAc-en|\u0261|n|u\u02d0|_|s|l|\u00e6|\u0283|_|\u02c8|l|\u026a|n|\u0259|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|SLASH|_|LIN|\u0259ks}}, be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the kernel Linux. Stallman refers to this operating system as \"a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer\".<ref name=\"linux gnu\"/> He claims that the connection between the GNU project's philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux.<ref name=\"in-a-name\"/>  Starting around 2003, he began also using the term ''GNU+Linux'', which he pronounces {{IPAc-en|\u0261|n|u\u02d0|_|p|l|\u028c|s|_|\u02c8|l|\u026a|n|\u0259|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|PLUS|_|LIN|\u0259ks}}, to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase ''GNU/Linux'' as {{IPAc-en|\u0261|n|u\u02d0|_|\u02c8|l|\u026a|n|\u0259|k|s}} {{respell|GNOO|_|LIN|\u0259ks}}, which would erroneously imply that the kernel Linux is maintained by the GNU project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-kernel-trap-interview.en.html |title=Interview with Richard Stallman, KernelTrap.org, 2005 |last=Andrews |first=Jeremy |publisher=GNU |year=2005 |access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref> The creator of Linux, [[Linus Torvalds]], has publicly stated that he objects to modification of the name, and that the rename \"is their [the [[Free software foundation|FSF]]] confusion not ours\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |title=LKML: Linus Torvalds: Re: GPLv3 Position Statement |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/25/161 |website=lkml.org |publisher=Linux Kernel Mailing List |access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"black-and-white\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nStallman resides in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"Lifestyle\"/> He speaks English, French, Spanish and some Indonesian.<ref name=\"Lifestyle\" /> He has said that he is \"an atheist of [[Jewish]] ancestry\"<ref name=\"stallman-jewish-source-1\"/> and often wears a button that reads \"Impeach God\".<ref name=\"freeasinfreedom-chap4\"/><ref name=\"Proulx\"/> He is openly [[childfree]].{{r|Stallman, Why It Is (2012)}}\n\nStallman refers to mobile phones as \"portable surveillance and [[Mobile phone tracking|tracking devices]]\",<ref name=\"gpl3-22june\"/> refusing to own a cell phone due to the lack of phones running entirely on free software.<ref name=\"infoweek\"/> He also avoids using a key card to enter his office building<ref name=\"shaggygod\"/> since key card systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, with the exception of a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb's grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites: the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, and then the script emails the user the web page content.<ref name=\"stallman-computing\"/><ref name=\"strawmen\"/> More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], except for [[Wikipedia]] (which generally disallows editing from Tor unless users have [[Wikipedia:IP block exemption|an IP block exemption]]).<ref name=\"SchuesslerInterview\"/><ref name=\"SchuesslerNewspaper\"/>\n\nStallman has written a collection of [[filk]] and parody songs, granting unlimited permission to sing and perform them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stallman.org/doggerel.html |title=Doggerel \u2013 Richard Stallman |website=www.stallman.org}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Abortion joke ===\nStallman received criticism for electing to keep a [[Political correctness|non-politically correct]] joke about [[Abortion in the United States|American federal policies toward abortion]] in the documentation for [[glibc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/09/gnu_glic_abort_stallman/|title=You have GNU sense of humor!

By 1910 the pavilion had been relocated in [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]], opposite the [[Marriott Plaza Hotel, Buenos Aires|Plaza Hotel]].

A central theme of his life was that \"it is the law of our nature to desire happiness. This law is not local, but universal; not temporary, but eternal. It is not a law to be proved by exceptions, for it knows no exception.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Horace |last=Mann |title=A Few Thoughts for a Young Man: A Lecture, Delivered Before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, on Its 29th Anniversary |year=1853 |page=9}}</ref> He served in the Massachusetts State legislature  (1827\u20131837). In 1848, after public service as Secretary of the [[Massachusetts State Board of Education]], Mann was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] (1848\u20131853). From September 1852 to his death, he served as President of [[Antioch College]].\n\nAbout Mann's intellectual progressivism, the historian [[Ellwood P. Cubberley]] said:\n\n{{quote|No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ellwood P. |last=Cubberley |title=Public Education in the United States |url=https://archive.org/details/publiceducationi00cubbuoft |year=1919 |page=[https://archive.org/details/publiceducationi00cubbuoft/page/167 167]}}</ref>}}\n\nArguing that universal public education was the best way to turn unruly American children into disciplined, judicious [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] citizens, Mann won widespread approval from modernizers, especially in the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], for building public schools.

On entering on his duties, he withdrew from all other professional or business engagements and from politics.\n\nHe held this position, and worked with a remarkable intensity, holding teachers' conventions, delivering numerous lectures and addresses, carrying on an extensive correspondence, and introducing numerous reforms. Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states and to feminize the teaching force. Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for \"[[normal schools]]\" to train professional teachers.<ref name=\"Mark Groen 1854, pp 251\u2013260\" />\n\nMann traveled to every school in the state so he could physically examine each school ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts [[normal school]] system in [[Framingham State College|Lexington]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), [[Westfield State College|Barre]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and [[Bridgewater State College|Bridgewater]], and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being \"among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state\".<ref name=\"hinsdale\">Hinsdale (1898).</ref> By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid=3535 |title=The Struggle for Public Schools |work=Digital History |last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, he founded and edited ''The Common School Journal''. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were:\n\n# the public should no longer remain ignorant; \n# that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; \n# that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; \n# that this education must be [[non-sectarian]]; \n# that this education must be taught using the tenets of a [[free society]]; and \n# that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers.\n\nUnder the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in [[Prussia]], and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England. Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also give an opportunity to the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would \"equalize the conditions of men.\" Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that by having schools it would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person's character was just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment. Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Eisenmann |title=Historical dictionary of women's education in the United States |year=1988 |page=259}}</ref> Mann believed that women were better suited for teaching, regardless of their status as a mother, and used his position to push for a [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminization]] of the profession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motherteacher : the feminization of American education|last=S.|first=Sugg, Redding|date=1978|publisher=University Press of Virginia|isbn=0813907578|location=Charlottesville|oclc=3708082}}</ref>\n\nThe practical result of Mann's work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas,<ref>{{cite book |first= Myra |last= Glenn |title= Campaigns Against Corporal Punishment |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-87395-813-6 |pages= 104\u20136}}</ref> and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools.\n\n===Secular nature===\nAs the ''Old Deluder Satan Act'' and other [[Massachusetts School Laws]] attest, early education in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann's leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen V. |last1=Monsma |first2=J.

There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools.

In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked.

It is not a law to be proved by exceptions, for it knows no exception.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Horace |last=Mann |title=A Few Thoughts for a Young Man: A Lecture, Delivered Before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, on Its 29th Anniversary |year=1853 |page=9}}</ref> He served in the Massachusetts State legislature  (1827\u20131837).

From September 1852 to his death, he served as President of [[Antioch College]].\n\nAbout Mann's intellectual progressivism, the historian [[Ellwood P.

Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for \"[[normal schools]]\" to train professional teachers.<ref name=\"Mark Groen 1854, pp 251\u2013260\" />\n\nMann traveled to every school in the state so he could physically examine each school ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts [[normal school]] system in [[Framingham State College|Lexington]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), [[Westfield State College|Barre]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and [[Bridgewater State College|Bridgewater]], and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being \"among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state\".<ref name=\"hinsdale\">Hinsdale (1898).</ref> By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid=3535 |title=The Struggle for Public Schools |work=Digital History |last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, he founded and edited ''The Common School Journal''. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were:\n\n# the public should no longer remain ignorant; \n# that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; \n# that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; \n# that this education must be [[non-sectarian]]; \n# that this education must be taught using the tenets of a [[free society]]; and \n# that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers.\n\nUnder the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in [[Prussia]], and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England. Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also give an opportunity to the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would \"equalize the conditions of men.\" Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that by having schools it would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person's character was just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment. Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Eisenmann |title=Historical dictionary of women's education in the United States |year=1988 |page=259}}</ref> Mann believed that women were better suited for teaching, regardless of their status as a mother, and used his position to push for a [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminization]] of the profession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motherteacher : the feminization of American education|last=S.|first=Sugg, Redding|date=1978|publisher=University Press of Virginia|isbn=0813907578|location=Charlottesville|oclc=3708082}}</ref>\n\nThe practical result of Mann's work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas,<ref>{{cite book |first= Myra |last= Glenn |title= Campaigns Against Corporal Punishment |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-87395-813-6 |pages= 104\u20136}}</ref> and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools.\n\n===Secular nature===\nAs the ''Old Deluder Satan Act'' and other [[Massachusetts School Laws]] attest, early education in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann's leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen V. |last1=Monsma |first2=J.

But here it stops, not because it claims to have compassed all truth; but because it disclaims to act as an umpire between hostile religious opinions.\"\n\nMann stated that this position resulted in a near-universal use of the Bible in the schools of Massachusetts and that this served as an argument against the assertion by some that Christianity was excluded from his schools, or that they were anti-Christian.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eURNAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=inculcates+all+Christian+morals;+it+founds+its+morals+on+the+basis+of+religion |last=Mann |first=Horace |title=Twelfth Annual Report for 1848 of the Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts |pages=116, 177, 121, 122|year=1849 }}</ref> A devotee of [[phrenology]], Mann believed education could eliminate or reduce human failings and compensate for any biological flaws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The teacher wars : a history of America's most embattled profession|last=Dana.|first=Goldstein|isbn=9780345803627|edition= First Anchor books |location=New York|oclc=895117195|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\nMann also once stated that \"it may not be easy theoretically, to draw the line between those views of religious truth and of Christian faith which is common to all, and may, therefore, with propriety be inculcated in schools, and those which, being peculiar to individual sects, are therefore by law excluded; still it is believed that no practical difficulty occurs in the conduct of our schools in this regard.\"\n\nRather than sanctioning a particular church as was often the norm in many states, the Legislature proscribed books \"calculated to favor the tenets of any particular set of Christians.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA14&dq=may+not+be+easy+theoretically,+to+draw+the+line+between+those+views+of+religious+truth+and+of+Christian+faith+which+is+common+to+all,+and+may,+therefore,+with+propriety+be+inculcated+in+schools,+and+those+which,+being+peculiar+to+individual+sects,+are+therefore+by+law+excluded;+still+it+is+believed+that+no+practical+difficulty+occurs+in+the+conduct+of+our+schools+in+this+regard |author=Massachusetts Board of Education |title=Annual Report of the Board of Education |origyear=Covering the year 1837 |pages=14, 15|year=1838 }}</ref>\n\n==U.S. Congress==\nIn the spring of 1848 he was elected to the [[United States Congress]] as a [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[John Quincy Adams]]. His first speech in that role was in advocacy of its right and duty to exclude [[slavery]] from the territories, and in a letter in December of that year he said: \"I think the country is to experience serious times. Interference with slavery will excite civil commotion in the South. But it is best to interfere. Now is the time to see whether the Union is a rope of sand or a band of steel.\" Again he said: \"I consider no evil as great as slavery, and I would pass the [[Wilmot Proviso]] whether the South rebel or not.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During the first session, he volunteered as counsel for [[Pearl incident|Drayton and Sayres]], who were indicted for stealing 76 slaves in the [[District of Columbia]], and at the trial was engaged for 21 successive days in their defense. In 1850, he was engaged in a controversy with [[Daniel Webster]] in regard to the extension of slavery and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]], calling Webster's support for the [[Compromise of 1850]] a \"vile catastrophe\", and comparing him to \"Lucifer descending from Heaven\".<ref>https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Speech_Costs_Senator_His_Seat.htm</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|title=Profiles in Courage| year=2004| pages=69\u201370}}</ref>  Mann was defeated by a single vote at the ensuing nominating convention by Webster's supporters; but, on appealing to the people as an independent anti-slavery candidate, he was re-elected, serving from April 1848 until March 1853.\n\n==Leadership of Antioch College and last years==\n[[File:HMann.jpg|left|thumb|Original daguerreotype of Rep. Mann (Mass.) from [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio, c. 1849.]]\nIn September 1852, he was nominated for [[governor of Massachusetts]] by the [[Free Soil Party]], and the same day was chosen president of the newly established [[Antioch College]] at [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]. Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, in which he continued until his death.  There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first female faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, [[Rebecca Pennell]], his niece. His commencement message to the class of 1859 was to \"be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antiochcollege.edu/news/archive/antioch-college-announced-horace-mann-fellowship-first-class |title=Antioch College Announced the Horace Mann Fellowship for First Class |publisher=Antioch College |date=February 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAntioch College was founded by the [[Christian Connexion]] which later withdrew its financial support causing the college to struggle for many years with meager financial resources due to sectarian infighting.  Mann himself was charged with nonadherence to sectarianism because, previously a Congregationalist by upbringing, he joined the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]].\n\nHe collapsed shortly after the 1859 commencement and died that summer. Antioch historian Robert Straker wrote that Mann had been \"crucified by crusading sectarians.\" [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] lamented \"what seems the fatal waste of labor and life at Antioch.\" Mann's wife, who wrote in anguish that \"the blood of martyrdom waters the spot,\" later disinterred his body from Yellow Springs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Burton R. |title=The Distinctive College |publisher=Adline Publishing Co. |year=1970 |page=16}}</ref> He is buried in the [[North Burial Ground]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]],<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K1acAAAAMAAJ&q=horace+mann+north+burial+ground&dq=horace+mann+north+burial+ground&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8lse71OjlAhVLHTQIHfmJAR8Q6AEIKTAA ''Horace Mann'']</ref> next to his first wife, Charlotte Messer Mann.

In 1818, [[John Griscom]] gave a favorable report of [[Prussian education system|Prussian education]].  Beginning in 1830, English translations were made of French philosopher [[Victor Cousin]]'s work, \"Report on the State of Public Education in Prussia.\"  [[Calvin E.

In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked. Mann focused on two aspects of Prussian education upon his return to the United States: the creation of [[Normal school|Normal Schools]] (although unlike Prussia, Mann advocated for a female-only teaching force) and well-appointed, safe, and well-resourced schoolhouses.\n\n==Works==\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/afewthoughtsfor02manngoog  A Few Thoughts for a Young Man]'' (Boston, 1850) \n* ''Slavery: Letters and Speeches'' (1851)\n* ''Powers and Duties of Woman'' (1853)\n* ''Sermons'' (1861)\n* ''Life and Complete Works of Horace Mann'' (2 vols., Cambridge, 1869)\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/thoughtsselected00mann Thoughts selected from the Writings of Horace Mann]'' (1869) \n* ''The Case for Public Schools''\n* Mann, Horace.
