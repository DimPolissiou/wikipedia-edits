Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section of several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maudgaly\u0101yana]], he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section of several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general. Studying M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts of [[Vinaya|monastic discipline]], Clarke points out that there is also an \"in-house\" perspective on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, which shows that he interacted with his former wife turned ''bhik\u1e63un\u012b'' frequently<!--107, 109--> to mentor her.<!--113--> Shortly after Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became ordained under the Buddha, he met his former wife Bhadra, who had joined an order of [[History of nudity#India|naked ascetics]] led by [[Purana Kassapa|Nirgrantha P\u016bra\u1e47a]] ({{lang-pi |P\u016bra\u1e47a Kassapa}}). She was regularly targeted for rape by her fellow ascetics, however.

By receiving food from these donors, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was considered a [[field of merit]] for them, or, in other words, an opportunity for them to make merit and \"vanquish their bad [[karma in Buddhism|karma]]\".<!--57--> In one case, he sought out a very poor woman who was at the end of her life, just to give her an opportunity to give a little.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers.

In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

It was originally recorded in February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London and released as a single by his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in May 1971 on [[B&C Records]]. Bowie subsequently re-recorded the song later that year with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]\u2014for release on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. The re-recording was co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in November 1971. On the album, the song directly introduces the character Ziggy Stardust, who describes himself as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] alien rock superstar who will save the Earth from the impending disaster described in the opening track \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\". It features saxophone played by Bowie and a guitar solo and string arrangement by Ronson.\n\nSince its release, \"Moonage Daydream\" has received critical acclaim, with many deeming Ronson's guitar work its clear standout. Bolder, Woodmansey and Scott have called it the best song on the album; retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs. He played it in concert throughout 1972\u201373 and on later tours. The ''Ziggy'' recording has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', while the Arnold Corns' recording has appeared on reissues of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''Ziggy Stardust''. The ''Ziggy'' recording has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012, which was subsequently included as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set in 2015, along with the Arnold Corns' recording.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Moonage Daydream\" was written during Bowie's US promotional tour in early February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After the tour Bowie formed a short-lived band, [[Arnold Corns]], named after the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Arnold Layne]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Led by Bowie, the band consisted of guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard, bassist Peter DeSomogyi and drummer Tim Broadbent, who were known previously as a trio called Rungk.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Arnold Corns recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\" on 25&nbsp;February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Bowie later hired openly gay dress designer Freddie Burretti, for whom he wrote \"Moonage Daydream\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}} Burretti did not appear on either track's recording.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=605}} Biographer [[Peter Doggett]] writes, the original version had a \"playful science-fiction-inspired chorus, two nondescript verses with a single memorable line, and an arrangement that not only racked his voice like a martyr under the Inquisition but virtually defined the word 'shambolic'.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the Corns' version lacks  the \"lightness of touch\" of the second.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Like Doggett, Pegg criticises the recording's arrangement and Bowie's vocal, calling it a \"strained attempt\" at an American [[Rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] vocal, along with an additional \"come on, you mothers!\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to [[Marc Spitz]], the Corns' version is melodically the same as the ''Ziggy'' version, but with a slightly different chorus.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Doggett believes that had the track and \"Hang On to Yourself\" not been re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'', they would have been forgotten.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Author Kevin Cann writes that once the lyrics were revised and \"given the Ziggy treatment\", it became a \"glittering glam gem\" in the context of the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=253}}\n\nBowie re-recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" on 12&nbsp;November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London for inclusion on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Woodmansey|2017|pp=88, 114}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as [[the Spiders from

\"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\", \"[[Lady Stardust]]\" and a re-recording of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Supermen]]\" during the session.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} The re-recording, like its parent album, is a [[glam rock]] song<ref>{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Reviews: \"David Bowie \u2013 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And

before.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Ronson begins it on guitar with a D chord described as an \"avalanche\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a \"pile-driver\", and an \"opening thunderbolt\" that is Ronson's \"declaration of intent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Pegg writes that the chord \"cuts across the fade-out\" of \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" taking the listener \"into the morass of sleazy sex and surreal science fiction that occupies the album's heart.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After a short pause, Bowie begins his vocal, which Doggett believes sounds far better than the \"metallic rasp\" of his 1970 recordings.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Bowie plays a saxophone and a [[pennywhistle]] during Ronson's solo, which are inspired by [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"Sho Know a Lot About Love\";{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie recalled in 2003 that he thought the combination of sax and piccolo was \"a great thing to put in a rock song\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> Ronson's guitar solo was mostly improvised after Bowie had conveyed the mood he wanted to him.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie later recalled in his 2002 book ''Moonage Daydream'':\n\n{{block quote|[I would] literally draw out on paper with a crayon or felt-tip pen the shape of a solo. The one in 'Moonage Daydream', for instance, started as a flat line that became a fat megaphone type shape, and ended as sprays of disassociated and broken lines.

Daydream'''\" is a song by English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]]. It was originally recorded in February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London and released as a single by his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in May 1971 on [[B&C Records]]. Bowie subsequently re-recorded the song later that year with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]\u2014for release on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. The re-recording was co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in November 1971. On the album, the song directly introduces the character Ziggy Stardust, who describes himself as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] alien rock superstar who will save the Earth from the impending disaster described in the opening track \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\". It features saxophone played by Bowie and a guitar solo and string arrangement by Ronson.\n\nSince its release, \"Moonage Daydream\" has received critical acclaim, with many deeming Ronson's guitar work its clear standout. Bolder, Woodmansey and Scott have called it the best song on the album; retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs. He played it in concert throughout 1972\u201373 and on later tours. The ''Ziggy'' recording has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', while the Arnold Corns' recording has appeared on reissues of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970) and ''Ziggy Stardust''. The ''Ziggy'' recording has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012, which was subsequently included as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set in 2015, along with the Arnold Corns' recording.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Moonage Daydream\" was written during Bowie's US promotional tour in early February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After the tour Bowie formed a short-lived band, [[Arnold Corns]], named after the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Arnold Layne]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Led by Bowie, the band consisted of guitarist Mark Carr-Pritchard, bassist Peter DeSomogyi and drummer Tim Broadbent, who were known previously as a trio called Rungk.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} Arnold Corns recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\" on 25&nbsp;February 1971 at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Bowie later hired openly gay dress designer Freddie Burretti, for whom he wrote \"Moonage Daydream\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}} Burretti did not appear on either track's recording.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=207}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=605}} Biographer [[Peter Doggett]] writes, the original version had a \"playful science-fiction-inspired chorus, two nondescript verses with a single memorable line, and an arrangement that not only racked his voice like a martyr under the Inquisition but virtually defined the word 'shambolic'.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the Corns' version lacks  the \"lightness of touch\" of the second.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Like Doggett, Pegg criticises the recording's arrangement and Bowie's vocal, calling it a \"strained attempt\" at an American [[Rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] vocal, along with an additional \"come on, you mothers!\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to [[Marc Spitz]], the Corns' version is melodically the same as the ''Ziggy'' version, but with a slightly different chorus.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Doggett believes that had the track and \"Hang On to Yourself\" not been re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'', they would have been forgotten.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Author Kevin Cann writes that once the lyrics were revised and \"given the Ziggy treatment\", it became a \"glittering glam gem\" in the context of the album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=253}}\n\nBowie re-recorded \"Moonage Daydream\" on 12&nbsp;November 1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London for inclusion on ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Woodmansey|2017|pp=88, 114}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], the lineup consisted of Bowie's backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]]\u2014comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\" /> The group recorded the track in two takes, as well as \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\", \"[[Lady Stardust]]\" and a re-recording of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Supermen]]\" during the session.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=231}} The re-recording, like its parent album, is a [[glam rock]] song<ref>{{cite web|title=Masterpiece Reviews: \"David Bowie \u2013 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And

metal]].{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=28}} Doggett writes that after learning from the \"vocal agonies\" of the Corns' recording, the Spiders decided to record the song three semitones lower than before.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Ronson begins it on guitar with a D chord described as an \"avalanche\",{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=187}} a \"pile-driver\", and an \"opening thunderbolt\" that is Ronson's \"declaration of intent\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Pegg writes that the chord \"cuts across the fade-out\" of \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" taking the listener \"into the morass of sleazy sex and surreal science fiction that occupies the album's heart.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} After a short pause, Bowie begins his vocal, which Doggett believes sounds far better than the \"metallic rasp\" of his 1970 recordings.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} Bowie plays a saxophone and a [[pennywhistle]] during Ronson's solo, which are inspired by [[the Hollywood Argyles]]' 1960 song \"Sho Know a Lot About Love\";{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie recalled in 2003 that he thought the combination of sax and piccolo was \"a great thing to put in a rock song\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> Ronson's guitar solo was mostly improvised after Bowie had conveyed the mood he wanted to him.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Bowie later recalled in his 2002 book ''Moonage Daydream'':\n\n{{block quote|[I would] literally draw out on paper with a crayon or felt-tip pen the shape of a solo. The one in 'Moonage Daydream', for instance, started as a flat line that became a fat megaphone type shape, and ended as sprays of disassociated and broken lines. I'd read somewhere that [[Frank Zappa]] used a series of drawn symbols to explain to his musicians how he wanted the shape of a composition to sound. Mick could take something like that and actually bloody play it, bring it to life. Very impressive.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}}}}\n\nThe song's strings, arranged and orchestrated by Ronson,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} appear at the return of the chorus, climaxing in a \"steep pizzicato descent.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}} They appear again during the fadeout, this time having a \"swirling phased\" effect that was Scott's idea during the mixing stage.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=328}} Doggett writes, \"Only in the final moments did Ronson's guitar provide the climactic release that the daydream demanded, continually returning to the same motifs as if in ecstatic spasm.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=119}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs the third track on the album, \"Moonage Daydream\" directly introduces the character of Ziggy Stardust,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} following \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" which describes an impending disaster that will result in Earth only having five years left and \"[[Soul Love (David Bowie song)|Soul Love]]\" in which numerous characters deal with love before the impending disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2009|p=187: \"Five Years\"}}; {{harvnb|Pegg|2016|p=445; \"Soul Love\"}}</ref> Once introduced, Ziggy proclaims himself \"an exotic hybrid of rock's past and mankind's future\": \"an alligator\" (strong and remorseless), \"a mama-papa\" (non-gender specific), \"the space invader\" (alien and phallic), \"a rock'n'rollin' bitch\" and a \"pink-monkey-bird\" (gay slang for a recipient of anal sex).{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Ziggy also praises the virtues of \"the church of man, love\" (or heard as \"the church of man-love\"); Pegg believes that this line is inspired in part by the proposed \"Church of God, Love and Man\" by philosopher [[Thomas Paine]], who Bowie often referenced indirectly (and directly on the 1990 [[Adrian Belew]] collaboration \"Pretty Pink Rose\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} Doggett believes that the \"carefree\" imagery Ziggy presents heightens the \"erotic fantasy\" of the chorus, described as \"a wet dream that was 'moonage' for the era of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions\" and for the tradition of \"muse poetry\" by [[Robert Graves]], which is linked to \"ancient cults that worshipped the moon, accessing the imagination without involving the intellect.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Doggett continues that as philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] said in 1971, \"the moon goddess was the goddess of magic, of the subconscious, of poetic inspiration.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Hence, a \"moonage daydream\" might represent \"an ecstatic, instinctive path to creativity\", or nothing more than an homage to \"[[Marc Bolan]]'s brand of lyrical imagery.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=118}} Bowie used several Americanisms on the original version of the song, most of which he which retained on the re-recording, using abbreviations such as \"comin'\", \"'lectric\" and \"rock'n'rollin'\", as well as phrases such as \"busting up my brains\", \"lay the real thing on me\", \"freak out\" and \"far out\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}} According to Pegg, there are several homages present\u2014including one to [[Iggy Pop]], whose lyric \"she got a TV eye on me\" turns into \"keep your 'lectric eye on me\", and one to [[Legendary Stardust Cowboy]], whose lyric \"I shot my space gun\" turns into \"put your ray gun to my head\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[File:Mick Ronson 1979.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=Mick Ronson playing guitar|[[Mick Ronson]]'s guitar work received unanimous praise from music critics, with most calling it the best aspect of the track.]]\nThe original version of \"Moonage Daydream\" by the short-lived band Arnold Corns was released in the UK by [[B&C Records]] as a single with \"Hang On to Yourself\" as the B-side in May 1971.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=216}}<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Moonage Daydream\"''|others=[[Arnold Corns|The Arnold Corns]]|year=1971|publisher=[[B&C Records]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=CB 149}}</ref> The re-recorded version was released as the third track on Bowie's fifth studio album ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'', between \"Soul Love\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\", on 16&nbsp;June 1972 by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> Discussing the song's placement in the album's track-listing, Pegg describes it as its \"keystone\" if one identifies the opening and closing tracks (\"Five Years\" and \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\", respectively) as the album's framework.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=327}}\n\n{{quote box|quote=When I walked into the control room and heard \"Moonage Daydream\" played back through the speakers for the first time I knew then we really had something special.

Yet each unique cultural remix always harkens back to an oral, mostly pre-literate, storytelling society in ancient Greece or India. No original Sanskrit ''Panchatantra'' nor Greek ''Aesop'' text survives: only theoretically reconstructed scholarly compilations from several diverse sources.\n\nWe thus only can enjoy and study the many recompiled [[derivative works]] and variants of the missing original ''Panchatantra'', of which the few surviving medieval Arabic ''Kalila wa Dimna'' manuscripts by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa]] (750 CE) remain as the keynote pivots between ancient India and modern Europe.\n\n[[Ibn al-Muqaffa]] is also personally responsible for the profuse flowering of Islamic manuscript illustration that uniquely stems from ''Kalila wa Dimna'', for his Preface to it clearly states that two of the book's four intentions (specifically, the second and the third) are <blockquote>\"to show the images (''khayalat'') of the animals in varieties of paints and colours (''asbagh'', ''alwan'') so as to delight the hearts of princes, increase their pleasure and also the degree of care which they would bestow on the work.  Thirdly, it was intended that the book should be such that both kings and common folk should not cease to acquire it; that it might be repeatedly copied and recreated in the course of time thus giving work to the painter (''musawwir'') and the copyist (''nasikh'')\".</blockquote>\n\n==First English remix by Sir Thomas North in 1570==\nThe [[Panchatantra]] fables first appeared in English as ''[[The Morall Philosophie of Doni]]'' in 1570,<ref>Full digital text: https://archive.org/details/earliestenglishv00doniuoft</ref> translated from the Italian by [[Sir Thomas North]], who also translated ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]''.<ref>This is the book by Sir Thomas North that made his more celebrated impact upon English literature: https://archive.org/details/shakespearesplut01plutuoft</ref> Wood\u2019s two ''Kalila and Dimna'' volumes are the first modern English, multiple-sourced, remix of these ancient fables since North's version. Wood\u2019s ''Kalila and Dimna \u2013 Fables of Friendship and Betrayal (Vol 1)'' is reconstituted from the North text and also seven other works translated from [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nIn his 'Afterword' to (citing the latest Kindle 2010 and 2011 subtitles) ''Fables of Friendship and Betrayal (Vol 1)'' and to ''Fables of Conflict and Intrigue (Vol 2)'' Wood suggests that these strikingly distinct literary compilations of ancient fables,<ref>See page 262 of ''Kalila and Dimna, Selected Fables of Bidpai'', retold by Ramsay Wood, Knopf, New York, 1980</ref> although highly revered classics in each target language, are among the world's most durable examples of cross-cultural migration, adaptive morphology and secular survival \u2013 as they have been widely and continuously shared and modified for over two thousand years, downstream from a legendary, long-lost, Sanskrit original manuscript known as the ''Ur-Panchantantra''.\n\n==Doris Lessing and the Institute for Cultural Research==\nIn her introduction to all seven English editions of ''Kalila and Dimna (Vol 1)''.

A review by [[Roger-Pol Droit]] in ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 15 September 2006 said:\n\n<blockquote>Crossing linguistic and cultural frontiers, these fables also transcend conventional time-frames. They abound with temporal paradoxes. Ancient letters, locked in a series of smaller and smaller treasure chests by King \tHouschenk in the past, are addressed to kings of the future. They contain words of advice whose meaning only becomes gradually clear, sometimes after a very big delay.</blockquote>\n\nIn September 2019 \u00c9ditions Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer published a revised mass market paperback edition.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:British writers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People associated with The Institute for Cultural Research]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge|Panchatantra|discuss=Talk:Ramsay Wood#Proposed merge with Panchatantra|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n'''Ramsay Wood''' is a former (1981-1990) performance storyteller,<ref>goodreads.com/author/show/4874417</ref> professional photographer and non-academic author of two late [[20th Century]] [[sui generis]] novels which aim \u2014 via vernacular spiels within complex [[frame-story]] narratives \u2014 to popularize the pre-literate, oral story-listening drama of multicultural animal fables mimed and declaimed along the ancient Silk Road.<ref>See ''The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction'' by James Millward (2013), Oxford University Press, Chapter 5: The arts on the silk road {{ISBN|0-19-978286-5}}</ref> His books blend ''[[Jataka Tales|The Jatakas Tales]]'', ''The [[Panchatantra]]'' and the likely (fourth century BCE) role of Alexander the Great's legacy in \"bringing the Aesopian tradition to North India and Central Asia\" via [[Alexander the Great#Legacy|Hellenization in Central Asia and India]].

No original Sanskrit ''Panchatantra'' nor Greek ''Aesop'' text survives: only theoretically reconstructed scholarly compilations from several diverse sources. \n\nWe thus only can enjoy and study the many recompiled [[derivative works]] and variants of the missing original ''Panchatantra'', of which the few surviving medieval Arabic ''Kalila wa Dimna'' manuscripts by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa]] (750 CE) remain as the keynote pivots between ancient India and modern Europe.\n\n[[Ibn al-Muqaffa]] is also personally responsible for the profuse flowering of Islamic manuscript illustration that uniquely stems from ''Kalila wa Dimna'', for his Preface to it clearly states that two of the book's four intentions (specifically, the second and the third) are <blockquote>\"to show the images (''khayalat'') of the animals in varieties of paints and colours (''asbagh'', ''alwan'') so as to delight the hearts of princes, increase their pleasure and also the degree of care which they would bestow on the work.  Thirdly, it was intended that the book should be such that both kings and common folk should not cease to acquire it; that it might be repeatedly copied and recreated in the course of time thus giving work to the painter (''musawwir'') and the copyist (''nasikh'')\".</blockquote>\n\n==First English remix by Sir Thomas North in 1570==\nThe [[Panchatantra]] fables first appeared in English as ''[[The Morall Philosophie of Doni]]'' in 1570,<ref>Full digital text: https://archive.org/details/earliestenglishv00doniuoft</ref> translated from the Italian by [[Sir Thomas North]], who also translated ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]''.<ref>This is the book by Sir Thomas North that made his more celebrated impact upon English literature: https://archive.org/details/shakespearesplut01plutuoft</ref> Wood\u2019s two ''Kalila and Dimna'' volumes are the first modern English, multiple-sourced, remix of these ancient fables since North's version. Wood\u2019s ''Kalila and Dimna \u2013 Fables of Friendship and Betrayal (Vol 1)'' is reconstituted from the North text and also seven other works translated from [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nIn his 'Afterword' to (citing the latest Kindle 2010 and 2011 subtitles) ''Fables of Friendship and Betrayal (Vol 1)'' and to ''Fables of Conflict and Intrigue (Vol 2)'' Wood suggests that these strikingly distinct literary compilations of ancient fables,<ref>See page 262 of ''Kalila and Dimna, Selected Fables of Bidpai'', retold by Ramsay Wood, Knopf, New York, 1980</ref> although highly revered classics in each target language, are among the world's most durable examples of cross-cultural migration, adaptive morphology and secular survival \u2013 as they have been widely and continuously shared and modified for over two thousand years, downstream from a legendary, long-lost, Sanskrit original manuscript known as the ''Ur-Panchantantra''.\n\n==Doris Lessing and the Institute for Cultural Research==\nIn her introduction to all seven English editions of ''Kalila and Dimna (Vol 1)''. [[Doris Lessing]] supports Wood's remix contention (and does so again in her monograph, ''Problems, Myths and Stories'').<ref>[http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/publications/monographarchive/Monograph36.pdf  Doris Lessing, ''Problems, Myths and Stories],'' London: Institute for Cultural Research Monograph Series No. 36, 1999, p 13</ref> Lessing also cites several literary variants of ''The Panchatantra''.

A review by [[Roger-Pol Droit]] in ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 15 September 2006 said:\n\n<blockquote>Crossing linguistic and cultural frontiers, these fables also transcend conventional time-frames. They abound with temporal paradoxes. Ancient letters, locked in a series of smaller and smaller treasure chests by King \tHouschenk in the past, are addressed to kings of the future. They contain words of advice whose meaning only becomes gradually clear, sometimes after a very big delay.</blockquote>\n\nIn September 2019 \u00c9ditions Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer published a revised mass market paperback edition.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n[[Category:British writers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People associated with The Institute for Cultural Research]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Wood"}

It is headquartered in [[Karachi]], Pakistan. As of March 2017, it has 1,450 [[branch (banking)|branches]] across Pakistan with assets of approximately [[USD]] 17.2 billion.<ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.nbp.com.pk/EcomomicBulletin/FS-Complete-31-12-2007.pdf</ref>\n\nThe bank provides both commercial and public sector banking services. It is a lead player in the debt-equity market, corporate investment banking, retail and consumer banking, agricultural financing, treasury services.\n\nNational Bank of Pakistan has developed a wide range of consumer products, to enhance business and cater to the different segments of society and meet its social responsibilities. Some schemes have been specifically designed for the low to middle-income segments of the population.  It has implemented special credit schemes like small finance for agriculture, business and industries, administrator to Qarz-e-Hasna loans to students, self-employment scheme for unemployed persons, public transport scheme. The Bank has expanded its range of products and services to include [[Islamic banking|Shariah Compliant Islamic Banking]] products. It has also put in place a [[remittance]] service for overseas Pakistanis to send their money back to Pakistan. Customer Social Responsibility is a new department which provides social services for Education, health and women empowerment.\n\n==History==\n*1949 National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) was established under the National Bank of Pakistan Ordinance of 1949 and was government-owned. NBP acted as an agent of the [[central bank]] wherever the State Bank did not have its own branch. It also undertook government treasury operations. Its first branches were in [[jute]] growing areas in [[East Pakistan]]. Offices in [[Karachi]] and [[Lahore]] followed.\n*1950 NBP established a branch in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].\n*1955 By this time NBP had branches in London and [[Calcutta]].\n*1957 NBP established a branch in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].\n*1962 NBP established a branch in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanganyika]].\n*1964 The Iraqi government nationalized NBP's [[Baghdad]] branch.\n*1965 The Indian government seized the [[Calcutta]] branch on the outbreak of hostilities between India and Pakistan.\n*1967 The [[Tanzania]]n government nationalized the [[Dar es Salaam]] branch.\n*1971 NBP acquired [[Bank of China]]'s two branches, one in [[Karachi]] and one at [[Chittagong]]. At separation of [[East Pakistan]] NBP lost its branches there. NBP merged with [[Pubali Bank|Eastern Mercantile Bank]] and with Eastern Bank Corporation.\n*1974 The government of Pakistan nationalized NBP. As part of the concomitant consolidation of the banking sector, NBP acquired [[Bank of Bahawalpur]].\n*1977 NBP opened an offshore brain [[Cairo]].\n*1994 NBP amalgamated Mehran Bank.\t\n*1997 NBP branch in [[Ashgabat]], [[Turkmenistan]] commenced operations.\n*2000 NBP opened a representative office in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]].\n*2001 [[State Bank of Pakistan]] and [[Bank of England]] agree to allow only 2 Pakistani banks to operate in the UK. NBP and [[United Bank Limited Pakistan|United Bank]] agreed to merge their operations to form Pakistan International Bank, of which NBP would own 45% and [[United Bank Limited Pakistan|United Bank]] 55%.\t\n*2002 Pakistan International Bank renamed itself United National Bank Limited (UNB). The ownership structure of the UNB remained as before.
