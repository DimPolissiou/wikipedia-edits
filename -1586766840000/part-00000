An East Slavic [[Old Novgorod dialect]], although it vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common [[Church Slavonic]] influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=477\u2013478, 480}} In the 19th century (in Russia until 1917), the language was often called \"[[Great Russian language|Great Russian]]\" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called \"White Russian\" and Ukrainian, then called \"Little Russian\".\n\nThe [[vocabulary]] (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], a developed and partly russified form of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] language used by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline.

The formation of the unified and centralized Russian state in 15th and 16th centuries and the gradual (re)emergence of a common political, economic, and cultural space have created the need for a common standard language.  The initial impulse for the standardization came from the government bureaucracy for the lack of a reliable tool of communication in administrative, legal, and judicial affairs became an obvious practical problem.  The earliest attempts at standardizing Russian were made based on the so-called Moscow official or chancery language.{{When|date=February 2020}} Since then the underlying logic of language reforms in Russia reflected primarily the considerations of standardizing and streamlining language norms and rules in order to ensure the Russian language's role as a practical tool of communication and administration.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of [[Peter the Great]], and developed from the Moscow ([[Central Russian dialects|Middle or Central Russian]]) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancery language.\n\n[[Mikhail Lomonosov]] first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755; in 1783 the [[Russian Academy]]'s first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, a period known as the \"Golden Age\", the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.\n\nUntil the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the [[Soviet government]]. Despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some nonstandard dialectal features (such as fricative {{IPA|[\u0263]}} in [[Southern Russian dialects]]) are still observed in colloquial speech.\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n{{Main|Geographical distribution of Russian speakers}}\n\n[[File:Russian ex-USSR 2004.PNG|thumb|upright=1.8|Competence of Russian in countries of the former Soviet Union (except Russia), 2004]]\n\nIn 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia \u2013 137.5 million, in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and Baltic countries \u2013 93.7 million, in Eastern Europe \u2013 12.9 million, Western Europe \u2013 7.3 million, Asia \u2013 2.7 million, Middle East and North Africa \u2013 1.3 million, Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 0.1 million, Latin America \u2013 0.2 million, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 4.1 million speakers.

The standard language is used in written and spoken form almost everywhere in the country, from Kaliningrad and Saint Petersburg in the West to Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the East, the enormous distance between notwithstanding.\n\nDespite [[Dialect levelling|leveling]] after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, \"Northern\" and \"Southern\", with [[Moscow]] lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern]], [[Central Russian dialects|Central]] (or Middle), and [[Southern Russian dialects|Southern]], with Moscow lying in the Central region.<ref>David Dalby. 1999\u20132000.

[[Dialectology]] within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary, and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.\n\nThe [[Northern Russian dialects]] and those spoken along the [[Volga River]] typically pronounce unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} clearly, a phenomenon called [[vowel reduction in Russian#Back vowels|okanye]] ({{lang|ru|\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}} Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have [[high vowel|high]] or [[diphthong]]al {{IPA|/e\u2053i\u032f\u025b/}} in the place of {{proto|slavic|\u011b}} and {{IPA|/o\u2053u\u032f\u0254/}} in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}} Another Northern dialectal morphological feature is a post-posed definite article ''-to'', ''-ta'', ''-te'' similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}\n\nIn the [[Southern Russian dialects]], instances of unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} following [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to {{IPA|[\u026a]}} (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced {{IPA|[a]}} in such positions (e.g. {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b'''\u0438'''}} is pronounced {{IPA|[n\u02b2a\u02c8sl\u02b2i]}}, not {{IPA|[n\u02b2\u026as\u02c8l\u02b2i]}}) \u2013 this is called [[yakanye]] ({{lang|ru|\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|access-date=2011-11-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607225323/http://gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|archivedate=2012-06-07|df=}}</ref>\nConsonants include a [[Voiced velar fricative|fricative {{IPA|/\u0263/}}]], a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w\u2053u\u032f/}}]] and {{IPA|/x\u2053xv\u2053xw/}}, whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, respectively.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}\nThe morphology features a palatalized final {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|access-date=2011-11-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212213519/http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|archivedate=2012-02-12|df=}}</ref> Some of these features such as akanye and yakanye, a [[debuccalized]] or [[lenited]] {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w\u2053u\u032f/}}]] and palatalized final {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and some dialects of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (Eastern [[Polesia]]n), indicating a linguistic continuum.\n\nThe city of [[Old Novgorod dialect|Veliky Novgorod]] has historically displayed a feature called [[chokanye]] or [[tsokanye]] ({{lang|ru|\u0447\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}} or {{lang|ru|\u0446\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}}), in which {{IPA|/t\u0255/}} and {{IPA|/ts/}} were switched or merged.

Also, the [[Slavic second palatalization|second palatalization]] of [[Velar consonant|velars]] did not occur there, so the so-called '''\u011b\u00b2''' (from the [[Proto-Slavic]] diphthong *ai) did not cause {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x/}} to shift to {{IPA|/ts, dz, s/}}; therefore, where Standard Russian has {{wikt-lang|ru|'''\u0446'''\u0435\u043f\u044c}} ('chain'), the form {{lang|ru|'''\u043a'''\u0435\u043f\u044c}} {{IPA|[k\u02b2ep\u02b2]}} is attested in earlier texts.\n\nAmong the first to study Russian dialects was [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] in the 18th century. In the 19th, [[Vladimir Dal]] compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century.

While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The [[yer]]s {{angbr|{{lang|ru|\u044a}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|ru|\u044c}}}} originally indicated the pronunciation of ''ultra-short'' or ''reduced'' {{IPA|/\u016d/}}, {{IPA|/\u012d/}}.\n\n=== Transliteration ===\n{{Further|Romanization of Russian|Informal romanizations of Russian}}\n\nBecause of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437}} ('frost') is transliterated ''moroz'', and  {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043c\u044b\u0448\u044c}} ('mouse'), ''mysh'' or ''my\u0161'''. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of [[Unicode]] [[character encoding]], which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet.  Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |last=Caloni |first=Wanderley |title=RusKey: mapping the Russian keyboard layout into the Latin alphabets |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |date=2007-02-15 |access-date=2011-01-28 |publisher=[[The Code Project]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301121842/http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Computing ===\nThe Russian alphabet has many systems of [[character encoding]]. [[KOI8-R]] was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of [[MS-DOS]] and [[OS/2]] ([[Code page 866|IBM866]]), traditional Macintosh ([[ISO/IEC 8859-5]]) and [[Microsoft Windows]] (CP1251) meant the proliferation of many different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a [[de facto standard]] in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995\u20132005.\n\nAll the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text-exchange data formats, having been mostly replaced with [[UTF-8]]. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. \"[[iconv]]\" is an example that is supported by most versions of [[Linux]], [[Macintosh]] and some other [[operating system]]s; but converters are rarely needed unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.\n\nIn addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] (which is very similar to the [[Greek alphabet]]), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.\n\n=== Orthography ===\n{{Main|Russian orthography}}\n\nRussian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. A number of rigid [[spelling rule]]s introduced between the 1880s and 1910s have been responsible for the former whilst trying to eliminate the latter.\n\nThe current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on [[Byzantine Greek]], was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.\n\nAccording to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional [[acute accent]] ({{lang|ru|\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: {{lang|ru|\u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0301\u043a}} (''zam\u00f3k'' - \"lock\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0437\u0430\u0301\u043c\u043e\u043a}} (''z\u00e1mok'' - \"castle\"), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0301\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}} (''st\u00f3yashchy'' - \"worthwhile\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0301\u0449\u0438\u0439}} (''stoy\u00e1shchy'' - \"standing\"), {{lang|ru|\u0447\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0301}} (''chudn\u00f3'' - \"this is odd\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0447\u0443\u0301\u0434\u043d\u043e}} (''ch\u00fadno'' - \"this is marvellous\"), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0301\u0446}} (''molod\u00e9ts'' - \"well done!\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u043c\u043e\u0301\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446}} (''m\u00f3lodets'' - \"fine young man\"), {{lang|ru|\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0301\u044e}} (''uzn\u00e1yu'' - \"I shall learn it\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0301}} (''uznay\u00fa'' - \"I recognize it\"), {{lang|ru|\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0301\u0442\u044c}} (''otrez\u00e1t'' - \"to be cutting\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0301\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c}} (''otr\u00e9zat'' - \"to have cut\"); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names, like {{lang|ru|\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0430}} (''af\u00e9ra'', \"scandal, affair\"), {{lang|ru|\u0433\u0443\u0301\u0440\u0443}} (''g\u00faru'', \"guru\"), {{lang|ru|\u0413\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f}} (''Garc\u00eda''), {{lang|ru|\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0301\u0448\u0430}} (''Ol\u00e9sha''), {{lang|ru|\u0424\u0435\u0301\u0440\u043c\u0438}} (''Fermi''), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence, for example {{lang|ru|\u0422\u044b\u0301 \u0441\u044a\u0435\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435?}} (''T\u00fd syel pechenye?'' - \"Was it ''you'' who ate the cookie?\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0422\u044b \u0441\u044a\u0435\u0301\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435?}} (''Ty sy\u00e9l pechenye?'' - \"Did you ''eat'' the cookie?) \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0422\u044b \u0441\u044a\u0435\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0301\u043d\u044c\u0435?}} (''Ty syel pech\u00e9nye?'' \"Was it the ''cookie'' you ate?\"). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Russian phonology}}\n\nThe phonological system of Russian is inherited from [[Common Slavonic]]; it underwent considerable modification in the early historical period before being largely settled around the year 1400.\n\nThe language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St.{{nbsp}}Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether the preceding consonant is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called ''hard'' and ''soft.'' The hard consonants are often [[velarization|velarized]], especially before front vowels, as in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Marshallese language#Phonology|Marshallese]]. The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear [[schwa]]. (See also: [[vowel reduction in Russian]].)\n\nThe Russian [[syllable]] structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the maximal structure can be described as follows:\n\n(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)\n\nHowever, Russian has a constraint on syllabification such that syllables cannot span multiple [[morpheme]]s.\n\nClusters of four consonants are not very common however, especially within a morpheme.

While {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x/}} do have palatalized [[allophone]]s {{IPA|[k\u02b2, \u0261\u02b2, x\u02b2]}}, only {{IPA|/k\u02b2/}} might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive. The only native [[minimal pair]] that argues for {{IPA|/k\u02b2/}} being a separate phoneme is {{lang|ru|\u044d\u0442\u043e {{wikt-lang|ru|\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c|\u0442\u043a\u0451\u0442}}}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u025bt\u0259 tk\u02b2\u0275t]}} ''eto tkyot'' - \"it weaves\"){{snd}}{{lang|ru|\u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442}}}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u025bt\u0259t kot]}}, ''etot kot'' - \"this cat\"). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}} and {{IPA|/d\u02b2/}}, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian \u0446\u044c, \u0434\u0437\u044c, or Polish \u0107, d\u017a). The sounds {{IPA|/t, d, ts, s, z, n, r\u02b2/}} are [[dental consonant|dental]], that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the [[alveolar ridge]].\n\n=== Vowels ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\"\n!\n!

Firstly with the newly conquered southwestern regions of former Kyivan Rus and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], later, when Moskovy cut its ties with the [[Golden Horde]], for communication between all newly consolidated regions of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moskovy]].\n\nIn terms of actual grammar, there are three [[tenses]] in Russian - past, present, and future - and each verb has two [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspects]] (perfective and imperfective).  Russian nouns each have a gender - either feminine, masculine, or neuter, indicated by spelling at the end of the word.  Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six [[Grammatical case|cases]]: Nominative (for the subject of the sentence), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of'), and Prepositional (used after a preposition).  Verbs of motion in Russian - such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim', and 'fly' - use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of [[prefix]]es to add more meaning to the verb.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Karion Istomin's alphabet P.jpg|thumb|This page from an \"ABC\" book printed in Moscow in 1694 shows the letter '''[[\u041f]]'''.]]\n\nSee [[History of the Russian language]] for an account of the successive foreign influences on Russian.\n\nThe number of listed words or entries in some of the major dictionaries published during the past two centuries, and the total vocabulary of [[Alexander Pushkin]] (who is credited with greatly augmenting and codifying literary Russian), are as follows:<ref>[http://www.gramota.ru/slovari/types/17_26 ''What types of dictionaries exist?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117151535/http://www.gramota.ru/slovari/types/17_26 |date=2012-01-17 }} from www.gramota.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yarus.asu.edu.ru/?id=426|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112125045/http://www.yarus.aspu.ru/?id=426|url-status=dead|title={section.caption}|archivedate=Jan 12, 2012|website=yarus.asu.edu.ru|accessdate=Feb 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

The political unification of this region into [[Kievan Rus']] in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus trace their origins, established [[Old East Slavic]] as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic [[Old Church Slavonic]] as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and [[calque]]s from [[Byzantine Greek]] began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.\n\n[[File:Ostromirovo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ostromir Gospels]] of 1056 is the second oldest [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] book known, one of many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s preserved in the [[Russian National Library]].]]\nDialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and in modern Russia [[History of the Russian language|medieval Russian]]. They became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of the land between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]] in the west and independent [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the [[Tatars]]) in the east.\n\nThe official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was [[Church Slavonic]], which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained [[Diglossia|the literary language]] for centuries, until the [[Peter I of Russia#Early reign|Petrine age]], when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterward the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.\n\nThe political reforms of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (\u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u043a\u0438\u0439, ''Py\u00f3tr Vel\u00edky'') were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke [[French language|French]] daily, and [[German language|German]] sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s (\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0301\u0439) ''[[War and Peace]]'', contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.\n\nThe modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of [[Alexander Pushkin]] ({{lang|ru|\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041f\u0443\u0301\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d}}) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized [[Russian literature]] by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called {{lang|ru|\u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0301\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c}} \u2014 \"high style\") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning.

In many places in eastern and southern [[Ukraine]] and throughout [[Belarus]], these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as [[Surzhyk]] in eastern Ukraine and [[Trasianka]] in [[Belarus]]. An East Slavic [[Old Novgorod dialect]], although it vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common [[Church Slavonic]] influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=477\u2013478, 480}} In the 19th century (in Russia until 1917), the language was often called \"[[Great Russian language|Great Russian]]\" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called \"White Russian\" and Ukrainian, then called \"Little Russian\".\n\nThe [[vocabulary]] (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], a developed and partly russified form of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] language used by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the East Slavic and the [[Church Slavonic]] forms are in use, with many different meanings.

The formation of the unified and centralized Russian state in 15th and 16th centuries and the gradual (re)emergence of a common political, economic, and cultural space have created the need for a common standard language.  The initial impulse for the standardization came from the government bureaucracy for the lack of a reliable tool of communication in administrative, legal, and judicial affairs became an obvious practical problem.  The earliest attempts at standardizing Russian were made based on the so-called Moscow official or chancery language.{{When|date=February 2020}} Since then the underlying logic of language reforms in Russia reflected primarily the considerations of standardizing and streamlining language norms and rules in order to ensure the Russian language's role as a practical tool of communication and administration.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of [[Peter the Great]], and developed from the Moscow ([[Central Russian dialects|Middle or Central Russian]]) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancery language.\n\n[[Mikhail Lomonosov]] first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755; in 1783 the [[Russian Academy]]'s first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, a period known as the \"Golden Age\", the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.\n\nUntil the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the [[Soviet government]]. Despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some nonstandard dialectal features (such as fricative {{IPA|[\u0263]}} in [[Southern Russian dialects]]) are still observed in colloquial speech.\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n{{Main|Geographical distribution of Russian speakers}}\n\n[[File:Russian ex-USSR 2004.PNG|thumb|upright=1.8|Competence of Russian in countries of the former Soviet Union (except Russia), 2004]]\n\nIn 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia \u2013 137.5 million, in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and Baltic countries \u2013 93.7 million, in Eastern Europe \u2013 12.9 million, Western Europe \u2013 7.3 million, Asia \u2013 2.7 million, Middle East and North Africa \u2013 1.3 million, Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 0.1 million, Latin America \u2013 0.2 million, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 4.1 million speakers.

The standard language is used in written and spoken form almost everywhere in the country, from Kaliningrad and Saint Petersburg in the West to Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the East, the enormous distance between notwithstanding.\n\nDespite [[Dialect levelling|leveling]] after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, \"Northern\" and \"Southern\", with [[Moscow]] lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern]], [[Central Russian dialects|Central]] (or Middle), and [[Southern Russian dialects|Southern]], with Moscow lying in the Central region.<ref>David Dalby. 1999\u20132000.

[[Dialectology]] within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary, and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.\n\nThe [[Northern Russian dialects]] and those spoken along the [[Volga River]] typically pronounce unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} clearly, a phenomenon called [[vowel reduction in Russian#Back vowels|okanye]] ({{lang|ru|\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}} Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have [[high vowel|high]] or [[diphthong]]al {{IPA|/e\u2053i\u032f\u025b/}} in the place of {{proto|slavic|\u011b}} and {{IPA|/o\u2053u\u032f\u0254/}} in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}} Another Northern dialectal morphological feature is a post-posed definite article ''-to'', ''-ta'', ''-te'' similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}\n\nIn the [[Southern Russian dialects]], instances of unstressed {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} following [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to {{IPA|[\u026a]}} (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced {{IPA|[a]}} in such positions (e.g. {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b'''\u0438'''}} is pronounced {{IPA|[n\u02b2a\u02c8sl\u02b2i]}}, not {{IPA|[n\u02b2\u026as\u02c8l\u02b2i]}}) \u2013 this is called [[yakanye]] ({{lang|ru|\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}}).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|access-date=2011-11-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607225323/http://gramota.ru/book/village/map13.html|archivedate=2012-06-07|df=}}</ref>\nConsonants include a [[Voiced velar fricative|fricative {{IPA|/\u0263/}}]], a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w\u2053u\u032f/}}]] and {{IPA|/x\u2053xv\u2053xw/}}, whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/v/}}, and final {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}, respectively.{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}\nThe morphology features a palatalized final {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).{{sfn|Sussex|Cubberley|2006|pp=521\u2013526}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Language of the Russian Village|language=Russian|url=http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|access-date=2011-11-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212213519/http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map14.html|archivedate=2012-02-12|df=}}</ref> Some of these features such as akanye and yakanye, a [[debuccalized]] or [[lenited]] {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, a [[semivowel|semivowel {{IPA|/w\u2053u\u032f/}}]] and palatalized final {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}} in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and some dialects of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (Eastern [[Polesia]]n), indicating a linguistic continuum.\n\nThe city of [[Old Novgorod dialect|Veliky Novgorod]] has historically displayed a feature called [[chokanye]] or [[tsokanye]] ({{lang|ru|\u0447\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}} or {{lang|ru|\u0446\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435}}), in which {{IPA|/t\u0255/}} and {{IPA|/ts/}} were switched or merged.

Also, the [[Slavic second palatalization|second palatalization]] of [[Velar consonant|velars]] did not occur there, so the so-called '''\u011b\u00b2''' (from the [[Proto-Slavic]] diphthong *ai) did not cause {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x/}} to shift to {{IPA|/ts, dz, s/}}; therefore, where Standard Russian has {{wikt-lang|ru|'''\u0446'''\u0435\u043f\u044c}} ('chain'), the form {{lang|ru|'''\u043a'''\u0435\u043f\u044c}} {{IPA|[k\u02b2ep\u02b2]}} is attested in earlier texts.\n\nAmong the first to study Russian dialects was [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] in the 18th century. In the 19th, [[Vladimir Dal]] compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century.

While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The [[yer]]s {{angbr|{{lang|ru|\u044a}}}} and {{angbr|{{lang|ru|\u044c}}}} originally indicated the pronunciation of ''ultra-short'' or ''reduced'' {{IPA|/\u016d/}}, {{IPA|/\u012d/}}.\n\n=== Transliteration ===\n{{Further|Romanization of Russian|Informal romanizations of Russian}}\n\nBecause of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437}} ('frost') is transliterated ''moroz'', and  {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043c\u044b\u0448\u044c}} ('mouse'), ''mysh'' or ''my\u0161'''. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of [[Unicode]] [[character encoding]], which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet.  Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.<ref>{{cite web |last=Caloni |first=Wanderley |title=RusKey: mapping the Russian keyboard layout into the Latin alphabets |url=http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |date=2007-02-15 |access-date=2011-01-28 |publisher=[[The Code Project]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301121842/http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11940/RusKey-mapping-the-Russian-keyboard-layout-into-th |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Computing ===\nThe Russian alphabet has many systems of [[character encoding]]. [[KOI8-R]] was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of [[MS-DOS]] and [[OS/2]] ([[Code page 866|IBM866]]), traditional Macintosh ([[ISO/IEC 8859-5]]) and [[Microsoft Windows]] (CP1251) meant the proliferation of many different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a [[de facto standard]] in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995\u20132005.\n\nAll the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text-exchange data formats, having been mostly replaced with [[UTF-8]]. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. \"[[iconv]]\" is an example that is supported by most versions of [[Linux]], [[Macintosh]] and some other [[operating system]]s; but converters are rarely needed unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.\n\nIn addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] (which is very similar to the [[Greek alphabet]]), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.\n\n=== Orthography ===\n{{Main|Russian orthography}}\n\nRussian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. A number of rigid [[spelling rule]]s introduced between the 1880s and 1910s have been responsible for the former whilst trying to eliminate the latter.\n\nThe current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on [[Byzantine Greek]], was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.\n\nAccording to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional [[acute accent]] ({{lang|ru|\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: {{lang|ru|\u0437\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0301\u043a}} (''zam\u00f3k'' - \"lock\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0437\u0430\u0301\u043c\u043e\u043a}} (''z\u00e1mok'' - \"castle\"), {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0301\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}} (''st\u00f3yashchy'' - \"worthwhile\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0301\u0449\u0438\u0439}} (''stoy\u00e1shchy'' - \"standing\"), {{lang|ru|\u0447\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0301}} (''chudn\u00f3'' - \"this is odd\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0447\u0443\u0301\u0434\u043d\u043e}} (''ch\u00fadno'' - \"this is marvellous\"), {{lang|ru|\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0301\u0446}} (''molod\u00e9ts'' - \"well done!\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u043c\u043e\u0301\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446}} (''m\u00f3lodets'' - \"fine young man\"), {{lang|ru|\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0301\u044e}} (''uzn\u00e1yu'' - \"I shall learn it\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0301}} (''uznay\u00fa'' - \"I recognize it\"), {{lang|ru|\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0301\u0442\u044c}} (''otrez\u00e1t'' - \"to be cutting\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0301\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c}} (''otr\u00e9zat'' - \"to have cut\"); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names, like {{lang|ru|\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0430}} (''af\u00e9ra'', \"scandal, affair\"), {{lang|ru|\u0433\u0443\u0301\u0440\u0443}} (''g\u00faru'', \"guru\"), {{lang|ru|\u0413\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f}} (''Garc\u00eda''), {{lang|ru|\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0301\u0448\u0430}} (''Ol\u00e9sha''), {{lang|ru|\u0424\u0435\u0301\u0440\u043c\u0438}} (''Fermi''), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence, for example {{lang|ru|\u0422\u044b\u0301 \u0441\u044a\u0435\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435?}} (''T\u00fd syel pechenye?'' - \"Was it ''you'' who ate the cookie?\") \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0422\u044b \u0441\u044a\u0435\u0301\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435?}} (''Ty sy\u00e9l pechenye?'' - \"Did you ''eat'' the cookie?) \u2013 {{lang|ru|\u0422\u044b \u0441\u044a\u0435\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0301\u043d\u044c\u0435?}} (''Ty syel pech\u00e9nye?'' \"Was it the ''cookie'' you ate?\"). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Russian phonology}}\n\nThe phonological system of Russian is inherited from [[Common Slavonic]]; it underwent considerable modification in the early historical period before being largely settled around the year 1400.\n\nThe language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St.{{nbsp}}Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether the preceding consonant is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called ''hard'' and ''soft.'' The hard consonants are often [[velarization|velarized]], especially before front vowels, as in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Marshallese language#Phonology|Marshallese]]. The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear [[schwa]]. (See also: [[vowel reduction in Russian]].)\n\nThe Russian [[syllable]] structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the maximal structure can be described as follows:\n\n(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)\n\nHowever, Russian has a constraint on syllabification such that syllables cannot span multiple [[morpheme]]s.\n\nClusters of four consonants are not very common however, especially within a morpheme.

While {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x/}} do have palatalized [[allophone]]s {{IPA|[k\u02b2, \u0261\u02b2, x\u02b2]}}, only {{IPA|/k\u02b2/}} might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive. The only native [[minimal pair]] that argues for {{IPA|/k\u02b2/}} being a separate phoneme is {{lang|ru|\u044d\u0442\u043e {{wikt-lang|ru|\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c|\u0442\u043a\u0451\u0442}}}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u025bt\u0259 tk\u02b2\u0275t]}} ''eto tkyot'' - \"it weaves\"){{snd}}{{lang|ru|\u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 {{wikt-lang|ru|\u043a\u043e\u0442}}}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u025bt\u0259t kot]}}, ''etot kot'' - \"this cat\"). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of {{IPA|/t\u02b2/}} and {{IPA|/d\u02b2/}}, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian \u0446\u044c, \u0434\u0437\u044c, or Polish \u0107, d\u017a). The sounds {{IPA|/t, d, ts, s, z, n, r\u02b2/}} are [[dental consonant|dental]], that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the [[alveolar ridge]].\n\n=== Vowels ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; float: left; margin-right: 1em;\"\n!\n!

Firstly with the newly conquered southwestern regions of former Kyivan Rus and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], later, when Moskovy cut its ties with the [[Golden Horde]], for communication between all newly consolidated regions of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moskovy]].\n\nIn terms of actual grammar, there are three [[tenses]] in Russian - past, present, and future - and each verb has two [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspects]] (perfective and imperfective).  Russian nouns each have a gender - either feminine, masculine, or neuter, indicated by spelling at the end of the word.  Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six [[Grammatical case|cases]]: Nominative (for the subject of the sentence), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of'), and Prepositional (used after a preposition).  Verbs of motion in Russian - such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim', and 'fly' - use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of [[prefix]]es to add more meaning to the verb.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n[[File:Karion Istomin's alphabet P.jpg|thumb|This page from an \"ABC\" book printed in Moscow in 1694 shows the letter '''[[\u041f]]'''.]]\n\nSee [[History of the Russian language]] for an account of the successive foreign influences on Russian.\n\nThe number of listed words or entries in some of the major dictionaries published during the past two centuries, and the total vocabulary of [[Alexander Pushkin]] (who is credited with greatly augmenting and codifying literary Russian), are as follows:<ref>[http://www.gramota.ru/slovari/types/17_26 ''What types of dictionaries exist?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117151535/http://www.gramota.ru/slovari/types/17_26 |date=2012-01-17 }} from www.gramota.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yarus.asu.edu.ru/?id=426|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112125045/http://www.yarus.aspu.ru/?id=426|url-status=dead|title={section.caption}|archivedate=Jan 12, 2012|website=yarus.asu.edu.ru|accessdate=Feb 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

The political unification of this region into [[Kievan Rus']] in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus trace their origins, established [[Old East Slavic]] as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic [[Old Church Slavonic]] as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and [[calque]]s from [[Byzantine Greek]] began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.\n\n[[File:Ostromirovo.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ostromir Gospels]] of 1056 is the second oldest [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] book known, one of many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s preserved in the [[Russian National Library]].]]\nDialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and in modern Russia [[History of the Russian language|medieval Russian]]. They became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of the land between the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]] in the west and independent [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the [[Tatars]]) in the east.\n\nThe official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was [[Church Slavonic]], which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained [[Diglossia|the literary language]] for centuries, until the [[Peter I of Russia#Early reign|Petrine age]], when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterward the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.\n\nThe political reforms of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] (\u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u043a\u0438\u0439, ''Py\u00f3tr Vel\u00edky'') were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke [[French language|French]] daily, and [[German language|German]] sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s (\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u0422\u043e\u043b\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0301\u0439) ''[[War and Peace]]'', contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.\n\nThe modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of [[Alexander Pushkin]] ({{lang|ru|\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041f\u0443\u0301\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d}}) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized [[Russian literature]] by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called {{lang|ru|\u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0301\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c}} \u2014 \"high style\") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''.
