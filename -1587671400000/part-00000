It varies from 19 to {{Convert|37|mi|km}} wide and is approximately {{Convert|75|mi|km}} long, forming the largest peninsula in the country. It is known for its beaches and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe main transport and commercial centre in the region is [[Nicoya]], one of the oldest settlements in Costa Rica. Ferries run between the town of Puntarenas on the mainland and the Nicoya Peninsula. There is an international airport in [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]] and small domestic airstrips in [[Nosara Airport|Nosara]], [[Carrillo Airport|Carrillo]] and Tambor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Transportation to the Nicoya Peninsula|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/regions/nicoya-peninsula-costa-rica}}</ref> The region was also featured in the book ''[[Blue Zones]]'', by Dan Buettner, which focused on the longevity found among Nicoya's residents.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Buettner\n|first=Dan\n|authorlink=Dan Buettner\n|title=The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest\n|url=https://archive.org/details/bluezones00danb\n|url-access=registration\n|accessdate=15 September 2009\n|edition=First Paperback\n|date=21 April 2009\n|origyear=2008\n|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]\n|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]\n|isbn= 978-1-4262-0400-5\n|oclc=246886564\n|chapter=Contents\n}}</ref>\n\n==Places of interest==\nOther notable settlements and places of interest in the area include (going roughly from north to south): [[Tamarindo, Costa Rica|Tamarindo]], [[Santa Cruz, Costa Rica|Santa Cruz]], [[Nosara]], [[S\u00e1mara, Costa Rica|S\u00e1mara]], Naranjo, [[Paquera]], [[Curu]], [[Tambor, Costa Rica|Tambor]], [[Montezuma, Costa Rica|Montezuma]], [[Santa Teresa, Costa Rica|Santa Teresa]], [[Malpais, Costa Rica|Mal Pais]].\n\nAnother very special place is Ostional Wildlife Refuge, is the second largest beach where the turtles come to nest.

This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] <math>H</math> defined for all <math>t \\in [0,T]</math> by:\n:<math>\nH(x(t),u(t),\\lambda(t),t)=\\lambda^{\\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \\,\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\lambda^{\\rm T}</math> is the transpose of <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\nPontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory <math>x^*</math>, optimal control <math>u^*</math>, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector <math>\\lambda^*</math> must  minimize the Hamiltonian <math>H</math> so that\n\n:<math>\n(1) \\qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\\lambda^*(t),t)\\leq H(x^*(t),u,\\lambda^*(t),t) \\,\n</math>\n\nfor all time <math>t \\in [0,T]</math> and for all permissible control inputs <math>u \\in \\mathcal{U}</math>.

Goldfaden is considered the father of modern Jewish theatre.\n\nIn 1876 he founded in [[Romania]] what is generally credited as the world's first professional [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] theater troupe. He was also responsible for the first [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] play performed in the United States. The [[Avram Goldfaden Festival]] of [[Ia\u015fi]], Romania, is named and held in his honour.\n\n[[Jacob Sternberg]] called him \"the [[Prince Charming]] who woke up the lethargic Romanian Jewish culture.\"<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 118</ref> [[Israil Bercovici]] wrote of his works: \"we find points in common with what we now call 'total theater'. In many of his plays he alternates prose and verse, pantomime and dance, moments of acrobatics and some of ''jonglerie'', and even of spiritualism...\"<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 237-238</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nGoldfaden was born in [[Starokonstantinov]] (Russia; present day [[Ukraine]]). His birthdate is sometimes given as July 12, following the [[Julian calendar|\"Old Style\"]] calendar in use at that time in the [[Russian Empire]]. He attended a Jewish religious school (a ''[[cheder]]''), but his middle-class family was strongly associated with the ''[[Haskalah]]'', or Jewish Enlightenment, and his father, a watchmaker,<ref name=\"Berkowitz, 2004, 12\">Berkowitz, 2004, 12</ref> arranged that he receive private lessons in German and Russian. As a child, he is said to have appreciated and imitated the performances of wedding jesters and [[Brody singer]]s to the degree that he acquired the nickname ''Avromele Badkhen,'' \"Abie the Jester.\"<ref name=\"Sandrow, 2003\">Sandrow, 2003</ref> In 1857 he began studies at the government-run rabbinical school at [[Zhytomyr]],<ref>Wolitz, Seth L. (August&nbsp;9, 2010). \"[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Goldfadn_Avrom Goldfadn, Avrom].\" ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2017-03-03.</ref> from which he emerged in 1866 as a teacher and a poet (with some experience in amateur theater), but he never led a congregation.\n\nGoldfaden's first published poem was called \"Progress\"; his ''[[The New York Times]]'' obituary described it as \"a plea for [[Zionism]] years before that movement developed.\"<ref name=\"NYT-1908Jan10\">\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/01/10/105001816.pdf Noted Jewish Bard Dead]\" (January 10, 1908). ''The New York Times''.</ref> In 1865 he published his first book of poetry, ''Tzitzim u-Ferahim'' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]); The ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1901\u20131906) says that \"Goldfaden's Hebrew poetry ... possesses considerable merit, but it has been eclipsed by his Yiddish poetry, which, for strength of expression and for depth of true Jewish feeling, remains unrivaled.\" The first book of verse in Yiddish was published in 1866, and in 1867 he took a job teaching in [[Simferopol]].\n\nA year later, he moved on to [[Odessa]] (in [[Ukraine]]). He lived initially in his uncle's house, where a cousin who was a good [[piano|pianist]] helped him set some of his poems to music. In Odessa, Goldfaden renewed his acquaintance with fellow Yiddish-language writer [[Yitzkhok Yoel Linetzky]], whom he knew from Zhytomyr<ref name=\"Berkowitz, 2004, 12\"/> and met [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] poet [[Eliahu Mordechai Werbel]] (whose daughter Paulina would become Goldfaden's wife) and published poems in the newspaper ''Kol-Mevaser''.  He also wrote his first two plays, ''Die Tzwei Sheines'' (''The Two Neighbors'') and ''Die Murneh Sosfeh'' (''Aunt Susie''), included with some verses in a modestly successful 1869 book ''Die Yidene'' (''The Jewish Woman''), which went through three editions in three years. At this time, he and Paulina were living mainly on his meagre teacher's salary of 18 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] a year, supplemented by giving private lessons and taking a job as a cashier in a hat shop.\n\nIn 1875, Goldfaden headed for [[Munich]], intending to study medicine. This did not work out, and he headed for [[Lviv|Lvov/Lemberg]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, ''Isrulik'' or ''Der Alter Yisrulik'' (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, he moved on to [[Chernivtsi]] in [[Bukovina]], where he edited the Yiddish-language daily ''Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt''. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to [[Ia\u015fi]] on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850\u20131930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.\n\n== Ia\u015fi ==\n[[File:Bustul lui Avraham Goldfaden din Ia\u015fi.jpg|thumb|200px|Avram Goldfaden's statue near the Ia\u015fi National Theatre]]\nArriving in [[Ia\u015fi|Ia\u015fi (Jassy)]] in 1876, Goldfaden was fortunate to be better known as a good poet \u2014 many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs \u2014 than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was just a way to starve; she suggested that there would be a lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Gr\u0103dina Pomul Verde (\"the Green Fruit-Tree Garden\").\n\nInstead of a simple recital, Goldfaden expanded the program into something of a [[vaudeville]] performance; either this or an indoor performance he and his fellow performers gave later that year in [[Boto\u015fani]] is generally counted as the first professional [[Yiddish theatre]] performance. However, in the circumstances, the designation of a single performance as \"the first\" may be nominal: Goldfaden's first actor, [[Israel Grodner]], was already singing Goldfaden's songs (and others) in the salons of Ia\u015fi; also, in 1873, Grodner sang in a concert in [[Odessa]] (songs by Goldfaden, among others) that apparently included significant improvised material between songs, although no actual script.\n\nAlthough Goldfaden, by his own account, was familiar at this time with \"practically all of Russian literature\", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an [[African American]] tragedian, [[Ira Aldridge]], performing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<ref name=\"Berkowitz, 2004, 12\"/> the performance at Gr\u0103dina Pomul Verde was only a bit more of a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, [[Sokher Goldstein]], and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either ''Di bobe mitn einikl'' (''Grandmother and Granddaughter'') or ''Dos bintl holts'' (''The Bundle of sticks''); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.)\n\nAfter that time, Goldfaden continued miscellaneous newspaper work, but the stage became his main focus.\n\nAs it happens, the famous Romanian poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], then journalist, saw one of the Pomul Verde performances later that summer. He records in his review that the company had six players. (A 1905 typographical error would turn this into a much-cited sixteen, suggesting a grander beginning for Yiddish theater.) He was impressed by the quality of the singing and acting, but found the pieces \"without much dramatic interest.<ref name=\"Bercovici\">Bercovici, 1998, 58</ref> His generally positive comments would seem to deserve to be taken seriously: Eminescu was known generally as \"virulently [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].\"<ref>Riff, 1992, 201</ref> Eminescu appears to have seen four of Goldfaden's early plays: a [[satire|satiric]] musical revue ''Di velt a gan-edn'' (''The World and Paradise''), ''Der farlibter maskil un der oyfgeklerter hosid'' (a dialogue between \"an infatuated philosopher\" and \"an enlightened [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]]\"), another musical revue ''Der shver mitn eidem'' (''Father-in-law and Son-in-Law''), and a comedy, ''Fishl der balegole un zayn knecht Sider'' (''Fishel the Junkman and His Servant Sider'').<ref name=\"Bercovici\"/>\n\n== Searching for a theater ==\nAs the season for outdoor performances was coming to a close, Goldfaden tried and failed to rent an appropriate theater in Ia\u015fi. A [[theatre]] owner named Reicher, presumably Jewish himself, told him that \"a troupe of Jewish singers\" would be \"too dirty.\" Goldfaden, Grodner, and Goldstein headed first to [[Boto\u015fani]], where they lived in a garret and Goldfaden continued to churn out songs and plays. An initial successful performance of ''Di Rekruten'' (''The Recruits'') in an indoor theater (\"with loges!\" as Goldfaden wrote) was followed by days of rain so torrential that no one would come out to the theater; they pawned some possessions and left for [[Gala\u0163i]], which was to prove a bit more auspicious, with a successful three-week run.\n\nIn Gala\u0163i they acquired their first serious set designer, a [[housepainter]] known as [[Reb Moishe Bas]]. He had no formal artistic training, but he proved to be good at the job, and joined the troupe, as did [[Sara Carp|Sara Segal]], their first actress. She was not yet out of her teens. After seeing her perform in their Gala\u0163i premiere, her mother objected to her unmarried daughter cavorting on a stage like that. Goldstein&nbsp;&ndash; who, unlike Goldfaden and Grodner, was single&nbsp;&ndash; promptly married her and she remained with the troupe. (Besides being known as Sara Segal and Sofia Goldstein, she became best known as Sofia Karp, after a second marriage to actor [[Max Karp]].)\n\nAfter the successful run in Gala\u0163i came a less successful attempt in [[Br\u0103ila]], but by now the [[company]] had honed its act and it was time to go to the capital, [[Bucharest]].\n\n== Bucharest ==\nAs in Ia\u015fi, Goldfaden arrived in Bucharest with his reputation already established. He and his players performed first in the early spring at the salon Laz\u0103r Cafegiu on Calea V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti ([[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti]] Avenue, in the heart of the [[ghetto]]), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigni\u0163a garden, a pleasant tree-shaded [[beer garden]] on Str. Negru Vod\u0103 that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue [[Hazzan|cantors]]. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained [[prima donna]]s, the sisters [[Margaretta Schwartz|Margaretta]] and [[Annetta Schwartz]].\n\nAmong the cantors in his casts that year were [[Laz\u0103r Zuckermann]] (also known as Laiser Zuckerman; as a song-and-dance man, he would eventually follow Goldfaden to New York and have a long stage career),<ref>Adler, 1999, 86 (commentary)</ref> Moishe Zilberman (also known as Silberman), and Simhe Dinman, as well as the 18-year-old [[Zigmund Mogulescu]] (Sigmund Mogulesko), who soon became a stage star. Orphaned by his teen years, Mogulescu had already made his way in the world as a singer&nbsp;&ndash; not only as a soloist in the Great Synagogue of Bucharest but also as a performer in cafes, at parties, with a visiting French [[operetta]] company, and even in a church choir. Before his voice changed, he had sung with Zuckerman, Dinman, and Moses Wald in the \"Israelite Chorus,\" performing at important ceremonies in the Jewish community. Mogulescu's audition for Goldfaden was a scene from ''Vl\u0103du\u0163u Mamei'' (''Mama's Boy''), which formed the basis later that year for Goldfaden's light comedy ''[[Shmendrik|Shemdrik, oder Die Komishe Chaseneh]]'' (''Shmendrik or The Comical Wedding''), starring Mogulescu as the almost painfully clueless and hapless young man (a role later famously played in New York and elsewhere by actress [[Molly Picon]]).\n\nThis recruiting of cantors was not without controversy: Cantor Cuper (also known as Kupfer), the head cantor of the Great Synagogue, considered it \"impious\" that cantors should perform in a secular setting, to crowds where both sexes mingled freely, keeping people up late so that they might not be on time for morning prayers.\n\nWhile one may argue over which performance \"started\" Yiddish theater, by the end of that summer in Bucharest Yiddish theater was an established fact. The influx of Jewish merchants and middlemen to the city at the start of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]] had greatly expanded the audience; among these new arrivals were [[Israel Rosenberg]] and [[Jacob Spivakovsky]], the highly cultured scion of a wealthy Russian Jewish family, both of whom actually joined Goldfaden's troupe, but soon left to found the first [[Yiddish theater]] troupe in [[Imperial Russia]].<ref>Adler, 1999, 60, 68</ref>\n\nGoldfaden was churning out a repertoire \u2013 new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in the first two years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) \u2013 and while he was not always able to retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a ''de facto'' training ground for Yiddish theater. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as [[Moses Horowitz]] with ''Der tiranisher bankir'' (''The Tyrannical Banker''), or Grodner with ''Curve un ganev'' (''Prostitute and Thief''), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.\n\nGoldfaden was helped by [[Ion Ghica]], then head of the [[Romanian National Theater]] to legally establish a \"dramatic society\" to handle administrative matters. From those papers, we know that the troupe at the Jigni\u0163a included Moris Teich, Michel Liechman (Gl\u00fcckman), Laz\u0103r Zuckermann, Margareta Schwartz, Sofia Palandi, Aba Goldstein, and Clara Goldstein. We also know from similar papers that when Grodner and Mogulescu walked out on Goldfaden to start their own company, it included (besides themselves) [[Israel Rosenberg]], [[Jacob Spivakovsky]], [[P. \u015eapira]], [[M. Banderevsky]], [[Anetta Grodner]], and [[Rosa Friedman]].\n\n[[Ion Ghica]] was a valuable ally for Yiddish theater in Bucharest. On several occasions he expressed his favorable view of the quality of acting, and even more of the technical aspects of the Yiddish theater. In 1881, he obtained for the National Theater the costumes that had been used for a Yiddish pageant on the coronation of King Solomon, which had been timed in tribute to the actual coronation of [[Carol I of Romania]].\n\n== Turning serious ==\nWhile light comedy and satire might have established [[Yiddish theater]] as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as \"the Yiddish Shakespeare.\"<ref name=\"NYT-1908Jan10\"/> As a man broadly read in several languages, he was acutely aware that there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature \u2013 that his audience was used to seeking just \"a good glass of [[Odobe\u015fti wine|Odobe\u015fti]] and a song.\" Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: \"We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart.\"\n\nGoldfaden wrote that this attitude put him \"pure and simply at war with the public.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} His stage was not to be merely \"a masquerade\"; he continued: \"No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry \u2013 while my heart shall be glad.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Nonetheless, his \"war with the public\" was based on understanding that public. He would also write, \"I wrote ''Di kishefmakhern'' (''[[The Witch of Boto\u015fani|The Witch]]'') in Romania, where the populace \u2013 Jews as much as Romanians \u2013 believe strongly in witches.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.\n\nEven in the first couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out vaudeville in Boto\u015fani had been ''Di Rekruten'' (''The Recruits''), playing with the theme of the [[Impressment|press gangs]] working the streets of that town to [[conscription|conscript]] young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated ''Desolate Island'' by [[August von Kotzebue]]; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although ''Shmendrik'' and ''The Two Kuni-Lemls'' were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious [[Yiddish]]-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being ''Shulamith'', also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. [[Nahma Sandrow]] suggests that it may have had equally as much to do with the arrival in Romania, at the time of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]], of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated [[Russian language]] theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to [[Odessa]].<ref name=\"Sandrow, 2003\"/>\n\nGoldfaden was both a theoretician and a practitioner of theater. That he was in no small measure a theoretician \u2013 for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays \u2013 relates to a key property of Yiddish theater at the time of its birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company \u2013 Ia\u015fi, Boto\u015fani, Gala\u0163i, Br\u0103ila, Bucharest \u2013 could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in [[Moldavia]] (and [[Transylvania]]), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.\n\nAlmost from the first, Yiddish theater drew a level of theater criticism comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a \"brochure\" by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the [[Elizabethan era]] for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from [[Purim play]]s to [[circus]] [[pantomime]]), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in ''Shmendrik'', or remarking of the play ''Di shtume kale'' (''The Mute Bride'') \u2014 a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines \u2014 that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.\n\n== Russia ==\nGoldfaden's father wrote him to solicit the troupe to come to [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]], which was then part of [[Imperial Russia]]. The timing was opportune: the end of the war meant that much of his best audience were now in Odessa rather than Bucharest; Rosenberg had already quit Goldfaden's troupe and was performing the Goldfadenian repertoire in Odessa.\n\nWith a loan from Librescu, Goldfaden headed east with a group of 42 people, including performers, musicians, and their families. After the end of the Russo-Turkish War he and his troupe travelled extensively through Imperial Russia, notably to [[Kharkov]] (also in Ukraine), Moscow, and [[Saint Petersburg]]. [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] later described him at this time as \"a ''bon vivant'',\" \"a cavalier,\" \"as difficult to approach as an emperor.\"<ref>Adler, 1999, 114, 116</ref> He continued to turn out plays at a prolific pace, now mostly serious pieces such as ''Doctor Almasada, oder Die Yiden in Palermo'' (''[[Doctor Almasado|Doctor Almasada, or The Jews of Palermo]]''), ''Shulamith'', and ''[[Bar Kokhba (play)|Bar Kokhba]]'', the last being a rather dark operetta about [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], written after the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire#1881\u201384|pogroms in Russia]] following the 1881 assassination of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].\n\nAs it happens, a [[France|Frenchman]] named Victor Tissot happened to be in [[Berdichev]] when Goldfaden's company was there. He saw two plays \u2013 ''Di Rekruten'', first premiered in Boto\u015fani, and the later ''Di Shvebleh'' (''Matches''), a play of intrigue. Tissot's account of what he saw gives an interesting picture of the theaters and audiences Goldfaden's troupe encountered outside of the big cities. \"Berdichev,\" he begins, \"has not one cafe, not one restaurant. Berdichev, which is a boring and sad city, nonetheless has a theatrical hall, a big building made of rough boards, where theater troupes passing through now and then put on a play.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Although there was a proper stage with a curtain, the cheap seats were bare benches, the more expensive ones were benches covered in red percale. Although there were many full beards, \"there were no long caftans, no skullcaps.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some of the audience were quite poor, but these were assimilated Jews, basically secular. The audience also included Russian officers with their wives or girlfriends.\n\nIn Russia, Goldfaden and his troupe drew large audiences and were generally popular with progressive Jewish intellectuals, but slowly ran afoul of both the Czarist government and conservative elements in the Jewish community. Goldfaden was calling for change in the Jewish world:\n\n: ''Wake up my people''\n: ''From your sleep, wake up''\n: ''And believe no more in foolishness.''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nA call like this might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were on the side of the status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia starting September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.\n\n== The prophet adrift ==\nWhile Yiddish theater continued successfully in various places, Goldfaden was not on the best terms at this time with Mogulescu. They had quarrelled (and settled) several times over rights to plays, and Mogulescu and his partner [[Moishe Finkel|Moishe \"Maurice\" Finkel]] now dominated Yiddish theater in Romania, with about ten lesser companies competing as well. Mogulescu was a towering figure in Bucharest theater at this point, lauded on a level comparable to the actors of the National Theater, performing at times in Romanian as well as Yiddish, drawing an audience that went well beyond the Jewish community.\n\nGoldfaden seems, in Bercovici's words, to have lost \"his theatrical elan\" in this period. He briefly put together a theater company in 1886 in [[Warsaw]], with no notable success. In 1887 he went to New York (as did Mogulescu, independently). After extensive negotiations and great anticipation in the Yiddish-language press in New York (\"Goldfaden in America,\" read the headline in the 11 January 1888 edition of the ''New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung''), he briefly took on the job of director of Mogulescu's new \"Rumanian Opera House\"; they parted ways again after the failure of their first play, whose production values were apparently not up to New York standards. Goldfaden attempted (unsuccessfully) to found a theater school, then headed in 1889 for [[Paris]], rather low on funds. There he wrote some poetry, worked on a play that he didn't finish at that time, and put together a theater company that never got to the point of putting on a play (because the cashier made off with all of their funds).<ref>Adler, 1999, 262 commentary</ref> In October 1889 he scraped together the money to get to [[Lviv|Lvov]], where his reputation as a poet again came to his rescue.\n\n== Lviv ==\nLviv was not exactly a dramatist's dream. Leon Dreykurs described audiences bringing meals into the theater, rustling paper, treating the theater like a beer garden. He also quotes Jacob Schatzky: \"All in all, the Galician milieu was not favorable to Yiddish theater. The intellectuals were assimilated, but the masses were fanatically religious and they viewed Jewish 'comedians' with disdain.\"<ref name=\"Bercovici, 1998, 88\">Bercovici, 1998, 88</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, who owned a Yiddish theater there, was glad to have a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden completed the play he'd started in Paris, ''Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas'' (\"Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree\"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based on the life of [[Josel of Rosheim]]. At this time he also wrote an operetta ''Rothschild'' and a semi-autobiographical play called ''Mashiach Tzeiten'' (''Messiah Times'') that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.\n\nKalman Juvelier, an actor in Ber Ghimpel's company, credited Goldfaden with greatly strengthening the caliber of performance in Lviv during his brief time there, reporting that Goldfaden worked with every actor on understanding his or her character, so as to ensure that the play was more than just a series of songs and effects, and was respected by all.<ref name=\"Bercovici, 1998, 88\"/>\n\n== Bucharest ==\n[[File:Goldfaden - a zecea porunca.jpg|thumb|left|This Romanian-language poster for ''The Tenth Commandment'' offers an alternate title ''Heaven and Hell''.]]\nBuoyed by his success in Lvov, he returned to Bucharest in 1892, as director of the Jigni\u0163a theater. His new company again included Laz\u0103r Zuckermann; other players were Marcu (Mordechai) Segalescu, and later Iacob Kalich, Carol Schramek, Malvina Treitler-L\u00f6bel and her father H. Goldenbers. Among his notable plays from this period were ''Dos zenteh Gebot, oder Lo tachmod'' (''The Tenth Commandment, or Thou Shalt Not Covet''), ''Judas Maccabaeus'', and ''Judith and Holofernes'' and a translation of [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]'s ''Gypsy Baron''.<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 88,, 91, 248</ref>\n\nHowever, it was not a propitious time to return to Romania. Yiddish theater had become a business there, with slickly written advertisements, coordinated performances in multiple cities using the same publicity materials, and cutthroat competition: on one occasion in 1895, a young man named Bernfeld attended multiple performances of Goldfaden's ''Story of Isaac'', memorized it all (including the songs), and took the whole package to Kalman Juvilier, who put on an unauthorized production in Ia\u015fi. Such outright theft was possible because once Ion Ghica headed off on a diplomatic career, the National Theater, which was supposed to adjudicate issues like unauthorized performances of plays, was no longer paying much attention to Yiddish theater. (Juvilier and Goldfaden finally reached an out-of-court settlement.)<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 89-90 attributes the account to Juvilier, although Sandrow, 2003, 12, tells this as being Leon Blank, not Juvilier</ref>\n\nCutthroat competition was nothing to what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and a rising tide of anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish [[socialism|socialists]] in Ia\u015fi starting ''Der Veker'' (''The Awakener'').\n\nGoldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was the only active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although [[Joseph Lateiner|Lateiner]], Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and occasionally managed to put on a play, it was not a good time for Yiddish theater \u2013 or any theater \u2013 in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.\n\nGoldfaden wandered Europe as a poet and journalist. His plays continued to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated \u2013 a 1903 letter refers to [[asthma]] and spitting up blood \u2013 and he was running out of money. In 1903, he wrote [[Jacob Dinesohn]] from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.\n\n== New York City ==\nIn America, he again tried his hand at journalism, but a brief stint as editor of the ''New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung'' resulted only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at [[Cooper Union]] to raise a pension for Yiddish poet [[Eliakum Zunser]], even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the [[Theodor Herzl|Dr. Herzl]] Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play ''David ba-Milchama'' (''David in the War''), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.\n\nHe also wrote the spoken portions of ''Ben Ami'', loosely based on [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Daniel Deronda]]''. After Goldfaden's former bit player [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] \u2014 by now the owner of a prominent New York Yiddish theater \u2014 optioned and ignored it, even accusing Goldfaden of being \"senile,\" it premiered successfully at rival [[Boris Thomashefsky]]'s People's Theater December 25, 1907, with music by H. Friedzel and lyrics by Mogulescu, who was by this time an international star.<ref>Sandrow, 2003, 14</ref>\n\nGoldfaden died in New York City in 1908. A contemporary account in ''[[The New York Times]]'' estimated that 75,000 people turned out for his funeral, joining the procession from the People's Theater on [[Bowery]] to [[Washington Cemetery (Brooklyn)|Washington Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]];<ref>{{cite news|title=75,000 At Poet's Burial - East Side Streets Thronged with Mourners for Abraham Goldfaden|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/01/11/104714620.html?pageNumber=1|accessdate=10 May 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 11, 1908|page=1}}</ref> in recent scholarship the number of mourners has been given as 30,000.<ref>Sandrow, Nahma. \"Goldfadn, Avrom\".

Cambridge University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|9780521434379}}. p.&nbsp;432.</ref> In a follow-up article ''The New York Times'' called him \"both a poet and a prophet,\" and noted that \"there was more evidence of genuine sympathy with and admiration for the man and his work than is likely to be manifested at the funeral of any poet now writing in the English language in this country.\"<ref>\"Burial of a Yiddish Poet\" (January 12, 1908). ''The New York Times''.</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, Goldfaden was the subject of postage stamps issued jointly by Israel and Romania.\n\n== Zionism ==\nGoldfaden had an on-again off-again relationship with [[Zionism]]. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist ''avant la lettre'' and one of his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (''Shulamith'' set in [[Jerusalem]], ''Mashiach Tzeiten?!'' ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900.<ref>Berkovitz, 2004, 15-16</ref> Still, he spent most of his life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Plays ===\n\n[[File:Goldfaden Bar Kochba.jpg|thumb|Libretto for Abraham Goldfaden's historical operetta ''Bar Kochba'' (1883), published in 1917]]\nSources disagree about the dates (and even the names) of some of Goldfaden's plays.

Goldfaden is considered the father of modern Jewish theatre.\n\nIn 1876 he founded in [[Romania]] what is generally credited as the world's first professional [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] theater troupe. He was also responsible for the first [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] play performed in the United States. The [[Avram Goldfaden Festival]] of [[Ia\u015fi]], Romania, is named and held in his honour.\n\n[[Jacob Sternberg]] called him \"the [[Prince Charming]] who woke up the lethargic Romanian Jewish culture.\"<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 118</ref> [[Israil Bercovici]] wrote of his works: \"we find points in common with what we now call 'total theater'. In many of his plays he alternates prose and verse, pantomime and dance, moments of acrobatics and some of ''jonglerie'', and even of spiritualism...\"<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 237-238</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nGoldfaden was born in [[Starokonstantinov]] (Russia; present day [[Ukraine]]). His birthdate is sometimes given as July 12, following the [[Julian calendar|\"Old Style\"]] calendar in use at that time in the [[Russian Empire]]. He attended a Jewish religious school (a ''[[cheder]]''), but his middle-class family was strongly associated with the ''[[Haskalah]]'', or Jewish Enlightenment, and his father, a watchmaker,<ref name=\"Berkowitz, 2004, 12\">Berkowitz, 2004, 12</ref> arranged that he receive private lessons in German and Russian. As a child, he is said to have appreciated and imitated the performances of wedding jesters and [[Brody singer]]s to the degree that he acquired the nickname ''Avromele Badkhen,'' \"Abie the Jester.\"<ref name=\"Sandrow, 2003\">Sandrow, 2003</ref> In 1857 he began studies at the government-run rabbinical school at [[Zhytomyr]],<ref>Wolitz, Seth L. (August&nbsp;9, 2010). \"[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Goldfadn_Avrom Goldfadn, Avrom].\" ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2017-03-03.</ref> from which he emerged in 1866 as a teacher and a poet (with some experience in amateur theater), but he never led a congregation.\n\nGoldfaden's first published poem was called \"Progress\"; his ''[[The New York Times]]'' obituary described it as \"a plea for [[Zionism]] years before that movement developed.\"<ref name=\"NYT-1908Jan10\">\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/01/10/105001816.pdf Noted Jewish Bard Dead]\" (January 10, 1908). ''The New York Times''.</ref> In 1865 he published his first book of poetry, ''Tzitzim u-Ferahim'' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]); The ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1901\u20131906) says that \"Goldfaden's Hebrew poetry ... possesses considerable merit, but it has been eclipsed by his Yiddish poetry, which, for strength of expression and for depth of true Jewish feeling, remains unrivaled.\" The first book of verse in Yiddish was published in 1866, and in 1867 he took a job teaching in [[Simferopol]].\n\nA year later, he moved on to [[Odessa]] (in [[Ukraine]]). He lived initially in his uncle's house, where a cousin who was a good [[piano|pianist]] helped him set some of his poems to music. In Odessa, Goldfaden renewed his acquaintance with fellow Yiddish-language writer [[Yitzkhok Yoel Linetzky]], whom he knew from Zhytomyr<ref name=\"Berkowitz, 2004, 12\"/> and met [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] poet [[Eliahu Mordechai Werbel]] (whose daughter Paulina would become Goldfaden's wife) and published poems in the newspaper ''Kol-Mevaser''.  He also wrote his first two plays, ''Die Tzwei Sheines'' (''The Two Neighbors'') and ''Die Murneh Sosfeh'' (''Aunt Susie''), included with some verses in a modestly successful 1869 book ''Die Yidene'' (''The Jewish Woman''), which went through three editions in three years. At this time, he and Paulina were living mainly on his meagre teacher's salary of 18 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] a year, supplemented by giving private lessons and taking a job as a cashier in a hat shop.\n\nIn 1875, Goldfaden headed for [[Munich]], intending to study medicine. This did not work out, and he headed for [[Lviv|Lvov/Lemberg]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, ''Isrulik'' or ''Der Alter Yisrulik'' (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, he moved on to [[Chernivtsi]] in [[Bukovina]], where he edited the Yiddish-language daily ''Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt''. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He tried unsuccessfully to operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to [[Ia\u015fi]] on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850\u20131930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.\n\n== Ia\u015fi ==\n[[File:Bustul lui Avraham Goldfaden din Ia\u015fi.jpg|thumb|200px|Avram Goldfaden's statue near the Ia\u015fi National Theatre]]\nArriving in [[Ia\u015fi|Ia\u015fi (Jassy)]] in 1876, Goldfaden was fortunate to be better known as a good poet \u2014 many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs \u2014 than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was just a way to starve; she suggested that there would be a lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Gr\u0103dina Pomul Verde (\"the Green Fruit-Tree Garden\").\n\nInstead of a simple recital, Goldfaden expanded the program into something of a [[vaudeville]] performance; either this or an indoor performance he and his fellow performers gave later that year in [[Boto\u015fani]] is generally counted as the first professional [[Yiddish theatre]] performance. However, in the circumstances, the designation of a single performance as \"the first\" may be nominal: Goldfaden's first actor, [[Israel Grodner]], was already singing Goldfaden's songs (and others) in the salons of Ia\u015fi; also, in 1873, Grodner sang in a concert in [[Odessa]] (songs by Goldfaden, among others) that apparently included significant improvised material between songs, although no actual script.\n\nAlthough Goldfaden, by his own account, was familiar at this time with \"practically all of Russian literature\", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an [[African American]] tragedian, [[Ira Aldridge]], performing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<ref name=\"Berkowitz, 2004, 12\"/> the performance at Gr\u0103dina Pomul Verde was only a bit more of a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, [[Sokher Goldstein]], and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either ''Di bobe mitn einikl'' (''Grandmother and Granddaughter'') or ''Dos bintl holts'' (''The Bundle of sticks''); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.)\n\nAfter that time, Goldfaden continued miscellaneous newspaper work, but the stage became his main focus.\n\nAs it happens, the famous Romanian poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], then journalist, saw one of the Pomul Verde performances later that summer. He records in his review that the company had six players. (A 1905 typographical error would turn this into a much-cited sixteen, suggesting a grander beginning for Yiddish theater.) He was impressed by the quality of the singing and acting, but found the pieces \"without much dramatic interest.<ref name=\"Bercovici\">Bercovici, 1998, 58</ref> His generally positive comments would seem to deserve to be taken seriously: Eminescu was known generally as \"virulently [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].\"<ref>Riff, 1992, 201</ref> Eminescu appears to have seen four of Goldfaden's early plays: a [[satire|satiric]] musical revue ''Di velt a gan-edn'' (''The World and Paradise''), ''Der farlibter maskil un der oyfgeklerter hosid'' (a dialogue between \"an infatuated philosopher\" and \"an enlightened [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]]\"), another musical revue ''Der shver mitn eidem'' (''Father-in-law and Son-in-Law''), and a comedy, ''Fishl der balegole un zayn knecht Sider'' (''Fishel the Junkman and His Servant Sider'').<ref name=\"Bercovici\"/>\n\n== Searching for a theater ==\nAs the season for outdoor performances was coming to a close, Goldfaden tried and failed to rent an appropriate theater in Ia\u015fi. A [[theatre]] owner named Reicher, presumably Jewish himself, told him that \"a troupe of Jewish singers\" would be \"too dirty.\" Goldfaden, Grodner, and Goldstein headed first to [[Boto\u015fani]], where they lived in a garret and Goldfaden continued to churn out songs and plays. An initial successful performance of ''Di Rekruten'' (''The Recruits'') in an indoor theater (\"with loges!\" as Goldfaden wrote) was followed by days of rain so torrential that no one would come out to the theater; they pawned some possessions and left for [[Gala\u0163i]], which was to prove a bit more auspicious, with a successful three-week run.\n\nIn Gala\u0163i they acquired their first serious set designer, a [[housepainter]] known as [[Reb Moishe Bas]]. He had no formal artistic training, but he proved to be good at the job, and joined the troupe, as did [[Sara Carp|Sara Segal]], their first actress. She was not yet out of her teens. After seeing her perform in their Gala\u0163i premiere, her mother objected to her unmarried daughter cavorting on a stage like that. Goldstein&nbsp;&ndash; who, unlike Goldfaden and Grodner, was single&nbsp;&ndash; promptly married her and she remained with the troupe. (Besides being known as Sara Segal and Sofia Goldstein, she became best known as Sofia Karp, after a second marriage to actor [[Max Karp]].)\n\nAfter the successful run in Gala\u0163i came a less successful attempt in [[Br\u0103ila]], but by now the [[company]] had honed its act and it was time to go to the capital, [[Bucharest]].\n\n== Bucharest ==\nAs in Ia\u015fi, Goldfaden arrived in Bucharest with his reputation already established. He and his players performed first in the early spring at the salon Laz\u0103r Cafegiu on Calea V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti ([[V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti, Bucharest|V\u0103c\u0103re\u015fti]] Avenue, in the heart of the [[ghetto]]), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigni\u0163a garden, a pleasant tree-shaded [[beer garden]] on Str. Negru Vod\u0103 that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue [[Hazzan|cantors]]. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained [[prima donna]]s, the sisters [[Margaretta Schwartz|Margaretta]] and [[Annetta Schwartz]].\n\nAmong the cantors in his casts that year were [[Laz\u0103r Zuckermann]] (also known as Laiser Zuckerman; as a song-and-dance man, he would eventually follow Goldfaden to New York and have a long stage career),<ref>Adler, 1999, 86 (commentary)</ref> Moishe Zilberman (also known as Silberman), and Simhe Dinman, as well as the 18-year-old [[Zigmund Mogulescu]] (Sigmund Mogulesko), who soon became a stage star. Orphaned by his teen years, Mogulescu had already made his way in the world as a singer&nbsp;&ndash; not only as a soloist in the Great Synagogue of Bucharest but also as a performer in cafes, at parties, with a visiting French [[operetta]] company, and even in a church choir. Before his voice changed, he had sung with Zuckerman, Dinman, and Moses Wald in the \"Israelite Chorus,\" performing at important ceremonies in the Jewish community. Mogulescu's audition for Goldfaden was a scene from ''Vl\u0103du\u0163u Mamei'' (''Mama's Boy''), which formed the basis later that year for Goldfaden's light comedy ''[[Shmendrik|Shemdrik, oder Die Komishe Chaseneh]]'' (''Shmendrik or The Comical Wedding''), starring Mogulescu as the almost painfully clueless and hapless young man (a role later famously played in New York and elsewhere by actress [[Molly Picon]]).\n\nThis recruiting of cantors was not without controversy: Cantor Cuper (also known as Kupfer), the head cantor of the Great Synagogue, considered it \"impious\" that cantors should perform in a secular setting, to crowds where both sexes mingled freely, keeping people up late so that they might not be on time for morning prayers.\n\nWhile one may argue over which performance \"started\" Yiddish theater, by the end of that summer in Bucharest Yiddish theater was an established fact. The influx of Jewish merchants and middlemen to the city at the start of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]] had greatly expanded the audience; among these new arrivals were [[Israel Rosenberg]] and [[Jacob Spivakovsky]], the highly cultured scion of a wealthy Russian Jewish family, both of whom actually joined Goldfaden's troupe, but soon left to found the first [[Yiddish theater]] troupe in [[Imperial Russia]].<ref>Adler, 1999, 60, 68</ref>\n\nGoldfaden was churning out a repertoire \u2013 new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (in the first two years, he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) \u2013 and while he was not always able to retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a ''de facto'' training ground for Yiddish theater. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as [[Moses Horowitz]] with ''Der tiranisher bankir'' (''The Tyrannical Banker''), or Grodner with ''Curve un ganev'' (''Prostitute and Thief''), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.\n\nGoldfaden was helped by [[Ion Ghica]], then head of the [[Romanian National Theater]] to legally establish a \"dramatic society\" to handle administrative matters. From those papers, we know that the troupe at the Jigni\u0163a included Moris Teich, Michel Liechman (Gl\u00fcckman), Laz\u0103r Zuckermann, Margareta Schwartz, Sofia Palandi, Aba Goldstein, and Clara Goldstein. We also know from similar papers that when Grodner and Mogulescu walked out on Goldfaden to start their own company, it included (besides themselves) [[Israel Rosenberg]], [[Jacob Spivakovsky]], [[P. \u015eapira]], [[M. Banderevsky]], [[Anetta Grodner]], and [[Rosa Friedman]].\n\n[[Ion Ghica]] was a valuable ally for Yiddish theater in Bucharest. On several occasions he expressed his favorable view of the quality of acting, and even more of the technical aspects of the Yiddish theater. In 1881, he obtained for the National Theater the costumes that had been used for a Yiddish pageant on the coronation of King Solomon, which had been timed in tribute to the actual coronation of [[Carol I of Romania]].\n\n== Turning serious ==\nWhile light comedy and satire might have established [[Yiddish theater]] as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as \"the Yiddish Shakespeare.\"<ref name=\"NYT-1908Jan10\"/> As a man broadly read in several languages, he was acutely aware that there was no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature \u2013 that his audience was used to seeking just \"a good glass of [[Odobe\u015fti wine|Odobe\u015fti]] and a song.\" Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: \"We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart.\"\n\nGoldfaden wrote that this attitude put him \"pure and simply at war with the public.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} His stage was not to be merely \"a masquerade\"; he continued: \"No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry \u2013 while my heart shall be glad.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Nonetheless, his \"war with the public\" was based on understanding that public. He would also write, \"I wrote ''Di kishefmakhern'' (''[[The Witch of Boto\u015fani|The Witch]]'') in Romania, where the populace \u2013 Jews as much as Romanians \u2013 believe strongly in witches.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.\n\nEven in the first couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out vaudeville in Boto\u015fani had been ''Di Rekruten'' (''The Recruits''), playing with the theme of the [[Impressment|press gangs]] working the streets of that town to [[conscription|conscript]] young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated ''Desolate Island'' by [[August von Kotzebue]]; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although ''Shmendrik'' and ''The Two Kuni-Lemls'' were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious [[Yiddish]]-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being ''Shulamith'', also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. [[Nahma Sandrow]] suggests that it may have had equally as much to do with the arrival in Romania, at the time of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]], of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated [[Russian language]] theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to [[Odessa]].<ref name=\"Sandrow, 2003\"/>\n\nGoldfaden was both a theoretician and a practitioner of theater. That he was in no small measure a theoretician \u2013 for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays \u2013 relates to a key property of Yiddish theater at the time of its birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company \u2013 Ia\u015fi, Boto\u015fani, Gala\u0163i, Br\u0103ila, Bucharest \u2013 could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in [[Moldavia]] (and [[Transylvania]]), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.\n\nAlmost from the first, Yiddish theater drew a level of theater criticism comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a \"brochure\" by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the [[Elizabethan era]] for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from [[Purim play]]s to [[circus]] [[pantomime]]), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in ''Shmendrik'', or remarking of the play ''Di shtume kale'' (''The Mute Bride'') \u2014 a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too nervous to deliver her lines \u2014 that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.\n\n== Russia ==\nGoldfaden's father wrote him to solicit the troupe to come to [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]], which was then part of [[Imperial Russia]]. The timing was opportune: the end of the war meant that much of his best audience were now in Odessa rather than Bucharest; Rosenberg had already quit Goldfaden's troupe and was performing the Goldfadenian repertoire in Odessa.\n\nWith a loan from Librescu, Goldfaden headed east with a group of 42 people, including performers, musicians, and their families. After the end of the Russo-Turkish War he and his troupe travelled extensively through Imperial Russia, notably to [[Kharkov]] (also in Ukraine), Moscow, and [[Saint Petersburg]]. [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] later described him at this time as \"a ''bon vivant'',\" \"a cavalier,\" \"as difficult to approach as an emperor.\"<ref>Adler, 1999, 114, 116</ref> He continued to turn out plays at a prolific pace, now mostly serious pieces such as ''Doctor Almasada, oder Die Yiden in Palermo'' (''[[Doctor Almasado|Doctor Almasada, or The Jews of Palermo]]''), ''Shulamith'', and ''[[Bar Kokhba (play)|Bar Kokhba]]'', the last being a rather dark operetta about [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], written after the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire#1881\u201384|pogroms in Russia]] following the 1881 assassination of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].\n\nAs it happens, a [[France|Frenchman]] named Victor Tissot happened to be in [[Berdichev]] when Goldfaden's company was there. He saw two plays \u2013 ''Di Rekruten'', first premiered in Boto\u015fani, and the later ''Di Shvebleh'' (''Matches''), a play of intrigue. Tissot's account of what he saw gives an interesting picture of the theaters and audiences Goldfaden's troupe encountered outside of the big cities. \"Berdichev,\" he begins, \"has not one cafe, not one restaurant. Berdichev, which is a boring and sad city, nonetheless has a theatrical hall, a big building made of rough boards, where theater troupes passing through now and then put on a play.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Although there was a proper stage with a curtain, the cheap seats were bare benches, the more expensive ones were benches covered in red percale. Although there were many full beards, \"there were no long caftans, no skullcaps.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some of the audience were quite poor, but these were assimilated Jews, basically secular. The audience also included Russian officers with their wives or girlfriends.\n\nIn Russia, Goldfaden and his troupe drew large audiences and were generally popular with progressive Jewish intellectuals, but slowly ran afoul of both the Czarist government and conservative elements in the Jewish community. Goldfaden was calling for change in the Jewish world:\n\n: ''Wake up my people''\n: ''From your sleep, wake up''\n: ''And believe no more in foolishness.''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nA call like this might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were on the side of the status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia starting September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.\n\n== The prophet adrift ==\nWhile Yiddish theater continued successfully in various places, Goldfaden was not on the best terms at this time with Mogulescu. They had quarrelled (and settled) several times over rights to plays, and Mogulescu and his partner [[Moishe Finkel|Moishe \"Maurice\" Finkel]] now dominated Yiddish theater in Romania, with about ten lesser companies competing as well. Mogulescu was a towering figure in Bucharest theater at this point, lauded on a level comparable to the actors of the National Theater, performing at times in Romanian as well as Yiddish, drawing an audience that went well beyond the Jewish community.\n\nGoldfaden seems, in Bercovici's words, to have lost \"his theatrical elan\" in this period. He briefly put together a theater company in 1886 in [[Warsaw]], with no notable success. In 1887 he went to New York (as did Mogulescu, independently). After extensive negotiations and great anticipation in the Yiddish-language press in New York (\"Goldfaden in America,\" read the headline in the 11 January 1888 edition of the ''New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung''), he briefly took on the job of director of Mogulescu's new \"Rumanian Opera House\"; they parted ways again after the failure of their first play, whose production values were apparently not up to New York standards. Goldfaden attempted (unsuccessfully) to found a theater school, then headed in 1889 for [[Paris]], rather low on funds. There he wrote some poetry, worked on a play that he didn't finish at that time, and put together a theater company that never got to the point of putting on a play (because the cashier made off with all of their funds).<ref>Adler, 1999, 262 commentary</ref> In October 1889 he scraped together the money to get to [[Lviv|Lvov]], where his reputation as a poet again came to his rescue.\n\n== Lviv ==\nLviv was not exactly a dramatist's dream. Leon Dreykurs described audiences bringing meals into the theater, rustling paper, treating the theater like a beer garden. He also quotes Jacob Schatzky: \"All in all, the Galician milieu was not favorable to Yiddish theater. The intellectuals were assimilated, but the masses were fanatically religious and they viewed Jewish 'comedians' with disdain.\"<ref name=\"Bercovici, 1998, 88\">Bercovici, 1998, 88</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, who owned a Yiddish theater there, was glad to have a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden completed the play he'd started in Paris, ''Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas'' (\"Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree\"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based on the life of [[Josel of Rosheim]]. At this time he also wrote an operetta ''Rothschild'' and a semi-autobiographical play called ''Mashiach Tzeiten'' (''Messiah Times'') that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.\n\nKalman Juvelier, an actor in Ber Ghimpel's company, credited Goldfaden with greatly strengthening the caliber of performance in Lviv during his brief time there, reporting that Goldfaden worked with every actor on understanding his or her character, so as to ensure that the play was more than just a series of songs and effects, and was respected by all.<ref name=\"Bercovici, 1998, 88\"/>\n\n== Bucharest ==\n[[File:Goldfaden - a zecea porunca.jpg|thumb|left|This Romanian-language poster for ''The Tenth Commandment'' offers an alternate title ''Heaven and Hell''.]]\nBuoyed by his success in Lvov, he returned to Bucharest in 1892, as director of the Jigni\u0163a theater. His new company again included Laz\u0103r Zuckermann; other players were Marcu (Mordechai) Segalescu, and later Iacob Kalich, Carol Schramek, Malvina Treitler-L\u00f6bel and her father H. Goldenbers. Among his notable plays from this period were ''Dos zenteh Gebot, oder Lo tachmod'' (''The Tenth Commandment, or Thou Shalt Not Covet''), ''Judas Maccabaeus'', and ''Judith and Holfernes'' and a translation of [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]'s ''Gypsy Baron''.<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 88,, 91, 248</ref>\n\nHowever, it was not a propitious time to return to Romania. Yiddish theater had become a business there, with slickly written advertisements, coordinated performances in multiple cities using the same publicity materials, and cutthroat competition: on one occasion in 1895, a young man named Bernfeld attended multiple performances of Goldfaden's ''Story of Isaac'', memorized it all (including the songs), and took the whole package to Kalman Juvilier, who put on an unauthorized production in Ia\u015fi. Such outright theft was possible because once Ion Ghica headed off on a diplomatic career, the National Theater, which was supposed to adjudicate issues like unauthorized performances of plays, was no longer paying much attention to Yiddish theater. (Juvilier and Goldfaden finally reached an out-of-court settlement.)<ref>Bercovici, 1998, 89-90 attributes the account to Juvilier, although Sandrow, 2003, 12, tells this as being Leon Blank, not Juvilier</ref>\n\nCutthroat competition was nothing to what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and a rising tide of anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish [[socialism|socialists]] in Ia\u015fi starting ''Der Veker'' (''The Awakener'').\n\nGoldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was the only active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although [[Joseph Lateiner|Lateiner]], Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and occasionally managed to put on a play, it was not a good time for Yiddish theater \u2013 or any theater \u2013 in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.\n\nGoldfaden wandered Europe as a poet and journalist. His plays continued to be performed in Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated \u2013 a 1903 letter refers to [[asthma]] and spitting up blood \u2013 and he was running out of money. In 1903, he wrote [[Jacob Dinesohn]] from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.\n\n== New York City ==\nIn America, he again tried his hand at journalism, but a brief stint as editor of the ''New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung'' resulted only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at [[Cooper Union]] to raise a pension for Yiddish poet [[Eliakum Zunser]], even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the [[Theodor Herzl|Dr. Herzl]] Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play ''David ba-Milchama'' (''David in the War''), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.\n\nHe also wrote the spoken portions of ''Ben Ami'', loosely based on [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Daniel Deronda]]''. After Goldfaden's former bit player [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] \u2014 by now the owner of a prominent New York Yiddish theater \u2014 optioned and ignored it, even accusing Goldfaden of being \"senile,\" it premiered successfully at rival [[Boris Thomashefsky]]'s People's Theater December 25, 1907, with music by H. Friedzel and lyrics by Mogulescu, who was by this time an international star.<ref>Sandrow, 2003, 14</ref>\n\nGoldfaden died in New York City in 1908. A contemporary account in ''[[The New York Times]]'' estimated that 75,000 people turned out for his funeral, joining the procession from the People's Theater on [[Bowery]] to [[Washington Cemetery (Brooklyn)|Washington Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]];<ref>{{cite news|title=75,000 At Poet's Burial - East Side Streets Thronged with Mourners for Abraham Goldfaden|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/01/11/104714620.html?pageNumber=1|accessdate=10 May 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 11, 1908|page=1}}</ref> in recent scholarship the number of mourners has been given as 30,000.<ref>Sandrow, Nahma. \"Goldfadn, Avrom\".

Cambridge University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|9780521434379}}. p.&nbsp;432.</ref> In a follow-up article ''The New York Times'' called him \"both a poet and a prophet,\" and noted that \"there was more evidence of genuine sympathy with and admiration for the man and his work than is likely to be manifested at the funeral of any poet now writing in the English language in this country.\"<ref>\"Burial of a Yiddish Poet\" (January 12, 1908). ''The New York Times''.</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, Goldfaden was the subject of postage stamps issued jointly by Israel and Romania.\n\n== Zionism ==\nGoldfaden had an on-again off-again relationship with [[Zionism]]. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist ''avant la lettre'' and one of his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (''Shulamith'' set in [[Jerusalem]], ''Mashiach Tzeiten?!'' ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900.<ref>Berkovitz, 2004, 15-16</ref> Still, he spent most of his life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Plays ===\n\n[[File:Goldfaden Bar Kochba.jpg|thumb|Libretto for Abraham Goldfaden's historical operetta ''Bar Kochba'' (1883), published in 1917]]\nSources disagree about the dates (and even the names) of some of Goldfaden's plays.

At the end of the series of ''Two and a Half Men,'' Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series; Sheen was fired in March 2011 and Cryer's on-screen son [[Angus T.

Those in favor of the Vietnam War became known as the ''neoconservatives'' (interventionists) as they marked a decisive split from the nationalist-isolationism that the [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditionalist conservatives]] (isolationists) had subscribed to up until this point.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993}}{{sfn|Gottfried|2006}}{{sfn|Scotchie|2017}}\n\nAccording to the [[international relations]] scholar [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley]], \"paleoconservatives press for restrictions on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], a rollback of [[multicultural]] programs and [[Whiteshift|large-scale demographic change]], the [[States' rights|decentralization of federal policy]], the restoration of [[Protectionism in the United States|controls upon free trade]], a greater emphasis upon [[economic nationalism]] and [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionism in the conduct of American foreign policy]]\".{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=318}}\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe prefix ''paleo'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root [[wikt:paleo-|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2]], meaning \"ancient\" or \"old\".

Murphy, paleoconservatives developed a focus on [[states' rights]] and [[Localism (politics)|political localism]]. From the mid-1980s onward, ''Chronicles''  promoted a Southern traditionalist worldview focused on national identity, regional particularity, and skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power.{{sfn|Murphy|2001|p=218}} According to Hague, Beirich, and Sebesta (2009), the [[antimodernism]] of the paleoconservative movement defined the [[neo-confederate]] movement of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, notable paleoconservative argued that [[desegregation]], welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislatures and think tanks.

During this time, notable paleoconservative argued that [[desegregation]], welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislatures and think tanks. Paleoconservatives also claimed the [[Southern Agrarians]] as forebearers in this regard.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hague |first1=Euan |last2=Beirich |first2=Heidi |last3=Sebesta |first3=Edward H. |title=Neo-Confederacy: A Critical Introduction |date=2009 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292779211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfWdaR9wHEEC |accessdate=3 December 2018 |language=en |pages=25\u201327}}</ref>\n\n=== Alt-right ===\nThe [[alt-right]] movement emerged out of the younger generation of paleoconservatives.
