Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132&nbsp;Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz, reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz, which is above the [[extremely high frequency|extremely high-frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400&nbsp;Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G. 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G.\n\nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25&nbsp;Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100&nbsp;Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Previously, some reserved the term 5G for systems that deliver download speeds of 20&nbsp;Gbit/s shared called for by [[ITU]] [[IMT-2020]]. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|title=Preparing the ground for IMT-2020|publisher=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2019-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414233657/https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|archive-date=April 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to traditional mobile operator services, 5G NR also addresses specific requirements for private mobile networks ranging from industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] to critical communications.\n\n==Overview==\n5G networks are [[digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. [[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi|doi-access = free }}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long.\n\nMassive [[MIMO]] (multiple-input multiple-output), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell. In the right frequencies and configuration, it can increase performance from 4 to 10 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wirelessone.news/9-mimo/687-china-mobile-softbank-ordering-1-000-s-of-massive-mimo-bases-2|title=\"I am crazy about Massive MIMO,\" Kitihara of Softbank ordering 1,000's of Massive MIMO bases|website=wirelessone.news|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Multiple [[bitstream]]s of data are transmitted simultaneously.

Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized.

This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Each antenna is individually-controlled and may embed radio transceiver components. Nokia claimed a five-fold increase in the capacity increase for a 64-Tx/64-Rx antenna system. The term \"massive MIMO\" was coined by Nokia Bell Labs researcher Dr. Thomas L.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132&nbsp;Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz, reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz, which is above the [[extremely high frequency|extremely high-frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400&nbsp;Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G. 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G.\n\nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25&nbsp;Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100&nbsp;Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms. The latency to the server, farther back in the network, raise the average to ~30 ms, 25\u201340% lower than typical 4G deployed. Adding \"Edge Servers\" close to the towers can bring latency down to 10\u201320 ms. Lower latency, such as the often touted 1 ms, is years away and does not include the time to the server.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018. Previously, some reserved the term 5G for systems that deliver download speeds of 20&nbsp;Gbit/s shared called for by [[ITU]] [[IMT-2020]]. 3GPP will submit their 5G NR to the ITU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|title=Preparing the ground for IMT-2020|publisher=www.3gpp.org|access-date=2019-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414233657/https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1901-imt2020_news|archive-date=April 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to traditional mobile operator services, 5G NR also addresses specific requirements for private mobile networks ranging from industrial [[Internet of things|IoT]] to critical communications.\n\n==Overview==\n5G networks are [[digital signal|digital]] [[cellular network]]s, in which the service area covered by providers is divided into small geographical areas called ''cells''. [[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi|doi-access = free }}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long.\n\nMassive [[MIMO]] (multiple-input multiple-output), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016.

This requires placing 5G base stations every few hundred meters in order to use higher frequency bands. Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Each antenna is individually-controlled and may embed radio transceiver components. Nokia claimed a five-fold increase in the capacity increase for a 64-Tx/64-Rx antenna system. The term \"massive MIMO\" was coined by Nokia Bell Labs researcher Dr. Thomas L.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]]. According to [[G\u00fcnther Oettinger]], the European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society (2014\u20132019), \"an innovative utilization of spectrum\" is one of the key factors at the heart of 5G success. Oettinger further described it as \"the essential resource for the wireless connectivity of which 5G will be the main driver\".<ref name=\"Speech at Mobile World Congress: The Road to 5G\">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/commission/content/speech-mobile-world-congress-road-5g-0_en|title=Speech at Mobile World Congress: The Road to 5G|date=March 2015|access-date=2015-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110001439/https://ec.europa.eu/commission/content/speech-mobile-world-congress-road-5g-0_en|archive-date=2015-11-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> iJOIN was selected by the [[European Commission]] as one of the pioneering 5G research projects to showcase early results on this technology at the [[Mobile World Congress]] 2015 (Barcelona, Spain).\n* In February 2013, ITU-R Working Party 5D (WP 5D) started two study items: (1) Study on IMT Vision for 2020 and beyond, and; (2) Study on future technology trends for terrestrial IMT systems.
