Upon Eve's arrival back to Salem, Paige's relationship with J.J. begins to hit a hard spot, ultimately ending with them parting ways multiples times. She becomes close to another guy, [[Cole Hines]] (Riley Bodenstab) and asks him out on a date, which he accepts. After their date, Paige meets up with J.J. at the park, where he apologizes profusely and asks for a second chance. She forgives him, leading them to reconcile. Cole finds her at the park watching Parker play and tells her that J.J. will hurt her and that she deserves better, but when he sees that she's not listening to him, he leaves. He then works with her mother Eve to break J.J. and Paige up. Cole plants drugs in J.J.'s backpack to frame him. When Paige realizes what Cole has done, she angrily confronts him.

She becomes a witness to the Chad and Serena fight and would reveal what she saw, since Serena would later be found murdered. Since they become close again, Paige is the first person J.J. tells about the Clyde/drug ring and was sworn not to involve the police. In early September, she would retell what she saw to Rafe and exchanges words with Chad, who doesn't remember what happened after the fight, and calls J.J. afterward; Paige had something to tell him, however, when J.J. arrives at her dorm, he finds her in the shower with a tie loosely around her neck.\n\nPaige is pronounced dead, much to the horror of J.J. and Eve who apologizes to Paige over her body. [[Chad DiMera]] is seen as the prime suspect, due to the fact that a flower found near the crime scene can only be found at the DiMera mansion; following the arrest of Chad, he was released after Aiden Jennings was believed to be the Neck Tie Killer.

In general, in [[organism]]s that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], embryonic development refers to the portion of the life cycle that begins just after [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] and continues through the formation of body structures, such as tissues and organs. Each embryo starts development as a [[zygote]], a single cell resulting from the fusion of [[gamete]]s (i.e. fertilization of a female [[egg cell]] by a male [[sperm]] cell). In the first stages of embryonic development, a single-celled zygote undergoes many rapid cell divisions, called [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], to form a [[blastula]], which looks similar to a ball of cells. Next, the cells in a blastula-stage embryo start rearranging themselves into layers in a process called [[gastrulation]]. These layers will each give rise to different parts of the developing multicellular organism, such as the nervous system, connective tissue, and [[Organogenesis|organs]].\n\nA newly developing human is typically referred to as an embryo until the ninth week after conception (see [[Human embryonic development|human embryogenesis]]), when it is then referred to as a [[fetus]].

In general, in [[organism]]s that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], embryonic development refers to the portion of the life cycle that begins just after [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] and continues through the formation of body structures, such as tissues and organs. Each embryo starts development as a [[zygote]], a single cell resulting from the fusion of [[gamete]]s (i.e. fertilization of a female [[egg cell]] by a male [[sperm]] cell). In the first stages of embryonic development, a single-celled zygote undergoes many rapid cell divisions, called [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], to form a [[blastula]], which looks similar to a ball of cells. Next, the cells in a blastula-stage embryo start rearranging themselves into layers in a process called [[gastrulation]]. These layers will each give rise to different parts of the developing multicellular organism, such as the nervous system, connective tissue, and [[Organogenesis|organs]].\n\nA newly developing human is typically referred to as an embryo until the ninth week after conception (see [[Human embryonic development|human embryogenesis]]), when it is then referred to as a [[fetus]]. In other multicellular organisms, the word \u201cembryo\u201d can be used more broadly to any early developmental or life cycle stage prior to [[birth]] or [[Hatchling|hatching]].\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst attested in English in the mid-14c., the word ''embryon'' derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''embryo'', itself from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd}} (''embruon''), lit. \"young one\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruon \u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531161449/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruon |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> which is the neuter of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2}} (''embruos''), lit. \"growing in\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruos \u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531041203/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmbruos |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> from \u1f10\u03bd (''en''), \"in\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29n \u1f10\u03bd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531101258/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29n |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c9 (''bru\u014d''), \"swell, be full\";<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbru%2Fw \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531101318/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbru%2Fw |date=2013-05-31 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> the proper [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of the Greek term would be ''embryum''.\n\n==Development==\n=== Animal embryos ===\n[[File:Embryonic development of a salamander, filmed in the 1920s.ogv|thumb|Embryonic development of salamander, circa the 1920s]]\n[[File:Wrinkledfrog embryos.jpg|thumb|Embryos (and one [[tadpole]]) of the wrinkled frog (''Rana rugosa'')]]\nIn animals, fertilization begins the process of embryonic development with the creation of a zygote, a single cell resulting from the fusion of gametes (e.g. egg and sperm).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/24-6-fertilization-and-early-embryonic-development/|title=24.6.\u00a0Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development \u2013 Concepts of Biology \u2013 1st Canadian Edition|website=opentextbc.ca|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> The development of a zygote into a multicellular embryo proceeds through a series of recognizable stages, often divided into cleavage, blastula, gastrulation, and organogenesis.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2000|title=The Circle of Life: The Stages of Animal Development|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9981/|journal=Developmental Biology. 6th Edition|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCleavage is the period of rapid mitotic cell divisions that occur after fertilization.

However, the extent of development and growth accomplished while inside of an egg or parent varies significantly from species to species, so much so that the processes that take place after hatching or birth in one species may take place well before those events in another.

The PP's term of office was undermined by a [[2017\u201318 Spanish constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis over the Catalan issue]],<ref name=\"BBC271017\"/> the result of a [[2017 Catalan regional election|regional election]] held thereafter,<ref name=\"CM221217\"/> coupled with corruption scandals and protests with thousands of retirees demanding pension increases.<ref name=\"NYT170318\"/> In May 2018, the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|National Court]] found in the [[G\u00fcrtel case]] that since 1989 the PP had profited from the kickbacks-for-contracts scheme and confirmed the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure kept separate from the party's official accounts. S\u00e1nchez, who was re-elected as PSOE leader in a [[2017 Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election|leadership contest in 2017]], brought down Rajoy's government in June 2018 through a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no confidence]].<ref name=\"TG240518\"/><ref name=\"ED250518\"/><ref name=\"ElPa\u00eds-27May18\"/><ref name=\"TG010618\"/> Rajoy resigned as PP leader and was subsequently [[2018 People's Party (Spain) leadership election|succeeded]] by [[Pablo Casado]].<ref name=\"EM050618\"/><ref name=\"EC050618\"/><ref name=\"EP210718\"/>\n\nPresiding over a minority government of 84 deputies, Pedro S\u00e1nchez struggled to maintain a working majority in the Congress with the support of the parties which had backed the no-confidence motion.

Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second most votes for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. However, in the [[1800 United States presidential election|election of 1800]] a tie in the electoral college between [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Aaron Burr]] led to the selection of the president by the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. To prevent such an event from happening again, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] was added to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency.<ref name=\"Senate\">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm|title=Vice President of the United States (President of the Senate)|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe vice president is the first person in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] and assumes that presidency if the president dies, resigns, or is impeached and removed from office.<ref>{{cite web| title=Vice President| url=https://system.uslegal.com/executive-branch/vice-president/| work=US Legal System| publisher=USLegal| accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref> Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way: eight ([[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]) through the president's death and one ([[Gerald Ford]]) through the president's resignation. In addition, the vice president serves as the president of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and may choose to cast a [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking vote]] on decisions made by the Senate. Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years.<ref name=\"Senate\"/>\n\nPrior to adoption of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] in 1967, an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president could not be filled until the next post-election inauguration. Several such vacancies occurred\u2014seven vice presidents died, one resigned and eight succeeded to the presidency. This amendment allowed for a vacancy to be filled through appointment by the president and confirmation by both chambers of the [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Since its ratification, the vice presidency has been vacant twice (both in the context of [[Presidency of Richard Nixon#Watergate and resignation|scandals surrounding the Nixon administration]]) and was filled both times through this process, namely in 1973 [[United States vice presidential selection, 1973|following Spiro Agnew's resignation]], and again in 1974 [[United States vice presidential selection, 1974|after Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency]].<ref name=\"Senate\"/> The amendment also established a procedure whereby a vice president may, if the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, temporarily assume the powers and duties of the office as [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]]. [[George H. W. Bush]] did so once on July 13, 1985. [[Dick Cheney]] did so twice on June 29, 2002 and on July 21, 2007.\n\nThe persons who have served as vice president were [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States by place of primary affiliation|born in or primarily affiliated with]] 27 states plus the [[District of Columbia]]. [[New York (state)|New York]] has produced the most of any state as eight have been born there and three others considered it their home state. Most vice presidents have been in their 50s or 60s and had political experience prior to assuming the office.<ref name=\"Senate\"/> The youngest person to become vice president was [[John C. Breckinridge]] at 36 years of age while the oldest was [[Alben W. Barkley]] at 71 years of age. Two vice presidents\u2014[[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]\u2014served under more than one president.\n\nThere are currently [[Living vice presidents of the United States|five living former vice presidents]].

Likewise, George Clinton is counted as the fourth and John Calhoun as the seventh, even though each one's consecutive terms in office were served under more than one president. Following the resignation of 39th vice president Spiro Agnew, Gerald Ford became the 40th vice president even though he was chosen to serve out the remainder of Agnew's second term.

Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second most votes for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. However, in the [[1800 United States presidential election|election of 1800]] a tie in the electoral college between [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Aaron Burr]] led to the selection of the president by the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. To prevent such an event from happening again, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] was added to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency.<ref name=\"Senate\">{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Vice_President.htm|title=Vice President of the United States (President of the Senate)|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe vice president is the first person in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] and assumes that presidency if the president dies, resigns, or is impeached and removed from office.<ref>{{cite web| title=Vice President| url=https://system.uslegal.com/executive-branch/vice-president/| work=US Legal System| publisher=USLegal| accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref> Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way: eight ([[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]) through the president's death and one ([[Gerald Ford]]) through the president's resignation. In addition, the vice president serves as the president of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and may choose to cast a [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States|tie-breaking vote]] on decisions made by the Senate. Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years.<ref name=\"Senate\"/>\n\nPrior to adoption of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] in 1967, an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president could not be filled until the next post-election inauguration. Several such vacancies occurred\u2014seven vice presidents died, one resigned and eight succeeded to the presidency. This amendment allowed for a vacancy to be filled through appointment by the president and confirmation by both chambers of the [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Since its ratification, the vice presidency has been vacant twice (both in the context of [[Presidency of Richard Nixon#Watergate and resignation|scandals surrounding the Nixon administration]]) and was filled both times through this process, namely in 1973 [[United States vice presidential selection, 1973|following Spiro Agnew's resignation]], and again in 1974 [[United States vice presidential selection, 1974|after Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency]].<ref name=\"Senate\"/> The amendment also established a procedure whereby a vice president may, if the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, temporarily assume the powers and duties of the office as [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]]. [[George H. W. Bush]] did so once on July 13, 1985. [[Dick Cheney]] did so twice on June 29, 2002 and on July 21, 2007.\n\nThe persons who have served as vice president were [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States by place of primary affiliation|born in or primarily affiliated with]] 27 states plus the [[District of Columbia]]. [[New York (state)|New York]] has produced the most of any state as eight have been born there and three others considered it their home state. Most vice presidents have been in their 50s or 60s and had political experience prior to assuming the office.<ref name=\"Senate\"/> The youngest person to become vice president was [[John C. Breckinridge]] at 36 years of age while the oldest was [[Alben W. Barkley]] at 71 years of age. Two vice presidents\u2014[[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]\u2014served under more than one president.\n\nThere are currently [[Living vice presidents of the United States|five living former vice presidents]].

Following the resignation of 39th vice president Spiro Agnew, Gerald Ford became the 40th vice president even though he was chosen to serve out the remainder of Agnew's second term.

Portrayed by [[Galen Gering]] and created by [[Dena Higley]], Rafe is introduced in 2008 as the FBI agent assigned to protect the troublesome [[Sami Brady]] ([[Alison Sweeney]]) during her stay in witness protection. Sami and Rafe's contentious dynamic later develops into romance and the two fall in love and eventually marry. However, their romance is plagued by Sami's [[EJ DiMera and Sami Brady|supercouple]] romance with Salem's resident badboy, [[EJ DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]). Rafe's disdain for the [[DiMera family]] grows when he discovers that EJ is behind the kidnapping and presumed death of Sami's daughter [[Sydney DiMera|Sydney]] and EJ's father [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]) replaces Rafe with a [[doppelganger]]. The series also introduces Rafe's younger sisters, [[Arianna Hernandez|Arianna]] ([[Lindsay Hartley]]) and [[Gabi Hernandez|Gabi]] ([[Camila Banus]]) and later his younger brother Dario ([[Jordi Vilasuso]]). Rafe is very protective of his siblings having helped raise them when their father abandoned the family. Rafe also has an affair with [[Kate Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] ([[Lauren Koslow]]) putting him at odds with Stefano, Kate's ex-husband. He later falls in love with physical therapist [[Jordan Ridgeway]] ([[Chrishell Stause]]) whom he tries to help overcome her own dark past. In 2015, Rafe is forced to confront his past when his estranged father Eduardo ([[A Martinez]]) resurfaces. Rafe later falls in love with his longtime colleague [[Hope Williams Brady|Hope Brady]] ([[Kristian Alfonso]]) and supports her when she loses her true love to a brain tumor. When a grief-stricken Hope murders Stefano, Rafe helps her cover it up.\n\n==Storylines==\n{{Long plot|section|date=June 2019}}\nIn October 2008, Federal Agent Rafe arrived in Salem to relay information to [[Sami Brady]] and her guard, who had been assigned to her as part of the witness protection program. As Sami had become increasingly agitated by her isolation, she had slipped sleeping pills to her guard and knocking her unconscious. As a result, Rafe was permanently assigned to guard Sami, with whom he initially had a combative relationship. As time went on, however, Rafe and Sami began to form a friendship. While Rafe kept fairly quiet about his personal life, he did tell Sami that as a young child, he frequented a local convent due to his troubling behavior. Rafe became one of the very few people to learn that Sami was pregnant with the child of [[E.J. DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]), and agreed to help her conceal this fact. As time went on, Rafe began to develop feelings for Sami and after her stint in Witness Protection ended, he pursued a position within the Salem Police Department so he might remain close to Sami and her baby. Rafe also began to reconnect with his younger sister, [[Arianna Hernandez|Arianna]] (then Felisha Terrell), who had concerns over his involvement with Sami. Despite Arianna's disapproval, Rafe continued to pursue Sami and asked her if he could legally adopt her baby, who they had named Grace. Tragically, several months later, Grace died from complications due to bacterial meningitis, leaving Sami and Rafe utterly devastated.\n\nFollowing Grace's death, Sami began to observe an emotional distance in Rafe and came to discover him at the graveside of a woman named Emily Hudson. Rafe revealed to Sami that he was once engaged to marry Emily, but she died on the day of their wedding in a tragic accident. When Sami began to investigate Rafe's past, which he would not elaborate upon, she turned up very little. Shortly afterwards, Emily's vengeful sister Meredith arrived in Salem, and after kidnapping Rafe, she attempted to kill him as she held him responsible for Emily's death. Rafe was rescued by [[Carly Manning]] ([[Crystal Chappell]]), who had recently returned to Salem following over fifteen years away. Following his recovery, Rafe began to investigate [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zuker]]), as he developed a theory that she had switched Grace with Sami's biological child. After collecting DNA samples from Sami, and the child, Sydney, Rafe was able to perform a DNA test and confirm that Sydney was in fact Sami's daughter. With Nicole's scheme exposed, she responded by abducting Sydney and leaving Salem. While she was on the run, Nicole encountered [[Anna Fredericks]] ([[Leann Hunley]]), who in turn kidnapped Sydney from Nicole. Anna began sending ransom notes to Sami, threatening her not involve the police. As a result, Sami began confiding in E.J. and leaving Rafe in the dark, resulting in Rafe ending their relationship.\n\nDespite the end of his relationship with Sami, Rafe continued to investigate Sydney's abduction and became convinced that Anna was working alongside E.J. Despite his efforts to convince Anna to turn on E.J., Rafe was unsuccessful. By chance, Rafe observed a suspicious conversation between E.J. and Nicole on the Salem Pier that seemed to strengthen his theory. Rafe became convinced that E.J. had confessed his involvement in the abduction to Nicole and could somehow persuade her to reveal his involvement. In an effort to gain her confession, Rafe attempted to convince Nicole he was interested in her. After a few drinks at The Cheatin' Heart, Nicole and Rafe headed back to her apartment, and stopped short of sleeping together. He remained the night anyway, and used this time to search Nicole's apartment for evidence to incriminate E.J. in Sydney's abduction, eventually stumbling upon a recording of E.J. admitting to paying Anna to kidnap Sydney. Rafe confronted Nicole with the recording, and assured her immunity from prosecution should she authenticate the recording.\n\nDuring Rafe's investigation into Sydney's kidnapping, E.J. and Sami had reconnected and were engaged to be married. On their wedding day, Rafe aired the recording of E.J.'s confession at their ceremony, resulting in Sami leaving E.J. Rafe and Sami reunited, resulting in him proposing to her. As they spent the night together, Sami snuck out intent on confronting E.J., whom she found unconscious and holding a gun. Sami used the gun to shoot E.J. in the head, and then proceeded to toss it into the river. When Sami's uncle, [[Bo Brady]] ([[Peter Reckell]]) questioned her about E.J.'s shooting, Rafe insisted that Sami was with him at the time of the shooting. Sami confessed her involvement in E.J.'s shooting to Rafe, and despite his dedication to the law, Rafe handed in his resignation to the FBI and swore to protect Sami at all costs. E.J. soon discovered Sami's guilt in his shooting, and began blackmailing her for sole custody of their two children, Johnny and Sydney. If she refused his demands, he would turn her, as well as Rafe and her eldest son, [[Will Horton]] (then [[Chandler Massey]]) in as accessories to attempted murder. With her back against the wall, a devastated Sami agreed to E.J.'s demands. Rafe assured Sami that he would do whatever he had to help her regain custody of the children, and in order to have one last happy memory before the hard times to follow, suggested they have the wedding that night. Sami agreed, and she and Rafe were married on November 24, 2010.\n\nFollowing their wedding, Rafe joined the Salem Police Department and began investigating E.J, hoping to uncover evidence against him and send him to prison. Rafe's investigation was quickly stalled, when it was discovered that Johnny had cancer. Rafe stood by Sami throughout the cancer ordeal, especially when Johnny needed to have one of his eyes removed. Johnny's cancer was discovered to have spread to his remaining eye, but as the doctors had caught it in time, they were able to treat it and spare his vision. With Johnny's crisis averted, E.J. began to allow Sami back into her children's lives. However, Rafe continued to remain in E.J.'s crosshairs. In fact EJ and Stefano had Rafe kidnapped and replace with imposter of Rafe. He lost his memory after Stefano drug him and whipping his memory however Rafe escape and got back to Sami revealing what EJ and his father did.

However, their romance is plagued by Sami's [[EJ DiMera and Sami Brady|supercouple]] romance with Salem's resident badboy, [[EJ DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]). Rafe's disdain for the [[DiMera family]] grows when he discovers that EJ is behind the kidnapping and presumed death of Sami's daughter [[Sydney DiMera|Sydney]] and EJ's father [[Stefano DiMera|Stefano]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]) replaces Rafe with a [[doppelganger]]. The series also introduces Rafe's younger sisters, [[Arianna Hernandez|Arianna]] ([[Lindsay Hartley]]) and [[Gabi Hernandez|Gabi]] ([[Camila Banus]]) and later his younger brother Dario ([[Jordi Vilasuso]]).

He later falls in love with physical therapist [[Jordan Ridgeway]] ([[Chrishell Stause]]) whom he tries to help overcome her own dark past. In 2015, Rafe is forced to confront his past when his estranged father Eduardo ([[A Martinez]]) resurfaces. Rafe later falls in love with his longtime colleague [[Hope Williams Brady|Hope Brady]] ([[Kristian Alfonso]]) and supports her when she loses her true love to a brain tumor. When a grief-stricken Hope murders Stefano, Rafe helps her cover it up.\n\n==Storylines==\n{{Long plot|section|date=June 2019}}\nIn October 2008, Federal Agent Rafe arrived in Salem to relay information to [[Sami Brady]] and her guard, who had been assigned to her as part of the witness protection program. As Sami had become increasingly agitated by her isolation, she had slipped sleeping pills to her guard and knocking her unconscious. As a result, Rafe was permanently assigned to guard Sami, with whom he initially had a combative relationship. As time went on, however, Rafe and Sami began to form a friendship. While Rafe kept fairly quiet about his personal life, he did tell Sami that as a young child, he frequented a local convent due to his troubling behavior. Rafe became one of the very few people to learn that Sami was pregnant with the child of [[E.J. DiMera]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]), and agreed to help her conceal this fact. As time went on, Rafe began to develop feelings for Sami and after her stint in Witness Protection ended, he pursued a position within the Salem Police Department so he might remain close to Sami and her baby. Rafe also began to reconnect with his younger sister, [[Arianna Hernandez|Arianna]] (then Felisha Terrell), who had concerns over his involvement with Sami. Despite Arianna's disapproval, Rafe continued to pursue Sami and asked her if he could legally adopt her baby, who they had named Grace. Tragically, several months later, Grace died from complications due to bacterial meningitis, leaving Sami and Rafe utterly devastated.\n\nFollowing Grace's death, Sami began to observe an emotional distance in Rafe and came to discover him at the graveside of a woman named Emily Hudson. Rafe revealed to Sami that he was once engaged to marry Emily, but she died on the day of their wedding in a tragic accident. When Sami began to investigate Rafe's past, which he would not elaborate upon, she turned up very little. Shortly afterwards, Emily's vengeful sister Meredith arrived in Salem, and after kidnapping Rafe, she attempted to kill him as she held him responsible for Emily's death. Rafe was rescued by [[Carly Manning]] ([[Crystal Chappell]]), who had recently returned to Salem following over fifteen years away. Following his recovery, Rafe began to investigate [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zuker]]), as he developed a theory that she had switched Grace with Sami's biological child. After collecting DNA samples from Sami, and the child, Sydney, Rafe was able to perform a DNA test and confirm that Sydney was in fact Sami's daughter. With Nicole's scheme exposed, she responded by abducting Sydney and leaving Salem. While she was on the run, Nicole encountered [[Anna Fredericks]] ([[Leann Hunley]]), who in turn kidnapped Sydney from Nicole. Anna began sending ransom notes to Sami, threatening her not involve the police. As a result, Sami began confiding in E.J. and leaving Rafe in the dark, resulting in Rafe ending their relationship.\n\nDespite the end of his relationship with Sami, Rafe continued to investigate Sydney's abduction and became convinced that Anna was working alongside E.J. Despite his efforts to convince Anna to turn on E.J., Rafe was unsuccessful. By chance, Rafe observed a suspicious conversation between E.J. and Nicole on the Salem Pier that seemed to strengthen his theory. Rafe became convinced that E.J. had confessed his involvement in the abduction to Nicole and could somehow persuade her to reveal his involvement. In an effort to gain her confession, Rafe attempted to convince Nicole he was interested in her. After a few drinks at The Cheatin' Heart, Nicole and Rafe headed back to her apartment, and stopped short of sleeping together. He remained the night anyway, and used this time to search Nicole's apartment for evidence to incriminate E.J. in Sydney's abduction, eventually stumbling upon a recording of E.J. admitting to paying Anna to kidnap Sydney. Rafe confronted Nicole with the recording, and assured her immunity from prosecution should she authenticate the recording.\n\nDuring Rafe's investigation into Sydney's kidnapping, E.J. and Sami had reconnected and were engaged to be married. On their wedding day, Rafe aired the recording of E.J.'s confession at their ceremony, resulting in Sami leaving E.J. Rafe and Sami reunited, resulting in him proposing to her. As they spent the night together, Sami snuck out intent on confronting E.J., whom she found unconscious and holding a gun. Sami used the gun to shoot E.J. in the head, and then proceeded to toss it into the river. When Sami's uncle, [[Bo Brady]] ([[Peter Reckell]]) questioned her about E.J.'s shooting, Rafe insisted that Sami was with him at the time of the shooting. Sami confessed her involvement in E.J.'s shooting to Rafe, and despite his dedication to the law, Rafe handed in his resignation to the FBI and swore to protect Sami at all costs. E.J. soon discovered Sami's guilt in his shooting, and began blackmailing her for sole custody of their two children, Johnny and Sydney. If she refused his demands, he would turn her, as well as Rafe and her eldest son, [[Will Horton]] (then [[Chandler Massey]]) in as accessories to attempted murder. With her back against the wall, a devastated Sami agreed to E.J.'s demands. Rafe assured Sami that he would do whatever he had to help her regain custody of the children, and in order to have one last happy memory before the hard times to follow, suggested they have the wedding that night. Sami agreed, and she and Rafe were married on November 24, 2010.\n\nFollowing their wedding, Rafe joined the Salem Police Department and began investigating E.J, hoping to uncover evidence against him and send him to prison. Rafe's investigation was quickly stalled, when it was discovered that Johnny had cancer. Rafe stood by Sami throughout the cancer ordeal, especially when Johnny needed to have one of his eyes removed. Johnny's cancer was discovered to have spread to his remaining eye, but as the doctors had caught it in time, they were able to treat it and spare his vision. With Johnny's crisis averted, E.J. began to allow Sami back into her children's lives. However, Rafe continued to remain in E.J.'s crosshairs. In fact EJ and Stefano had Rafe kidnapped and replace with imposter of Rafe.

It is kind of a \"push-pull for Jordan,\" she said.<ref name=\"About.com121913\"/> She said Jordan is \"definitely scared of her feelings for Rafe,\" because it is unprofessional to fall for a patient.

Of the character's past, she said fans would need to be patient because the story about Jordan's past would take some time to come out. \"Obviously some things have happened that she needs to run from or that she is afraid of.\" When Jordan's feelings for Rafe evolve, Jordan becomes much more vulnerable. She revealed to ''Soaps She Knows'' that \"We will see that dynamic come into play where even though she acts like she is not afraid of Kate, we will see that she is slightly afraid of the fact that Kate was able to pull up some stuff from the past and how it could affect her life.\" <ref name=\"SSK121213\"/>\n\nWith the casting of Jade Harlow in the recurring role of Sheryl, the show began developing and exploring the character's background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2014/01/update-on-jade-harlows-days-character-and-first-airdate|title=UPDATE on Jade Harlow's 'DAYS' Character and First Airdate|work=Soap Opera Network|first=Errol|last=Lewis|date=January 3, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> In February 2014, it was announced that country singer [[Justin Gaston]] had been cast as Jordan's brother, [[Ben Rogers (Days of our Lives)|Ben Rogers]], with whom she shares a secret past.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Errol|title= Country Music Singer/Actor Justin Gaston Joins 'Days of our Lives' In Contract Role |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2014/02/country-music-singeractor-justin-gaston-joins-days-of-our-lives-in-contract-role|work=Soap Opera Network|accessdate=February 6, 2014|date=February 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Storylines ==\nJordan arrived in Salem in mid-August 2013, per the request of Kate Roberts (Koslow) to help rehabilitate Rafe Hernandez (Gering), following his being attacked.<ref name=\"August 15, 2013\"/><ref name=\"8/15/2013\"/> Originally very guarded and off-putting, Jordan begins to let down her walls around Rafe, much to the chagrin of Kate.

She returned in early 2019 briefly, keeping Ciara Brady and Charlotte DiMera hostage to protect them from changed Ben and pointing all the evidences to him.

Jordan's arrival strikes a nerve with Kate, who thinks she is a man, because of her name. Kate feels threatened because of her \"friends with benefits\" relationship with Rafe.

However, Rafe treats it as a game, doing everything he can to break down the \"closed-off wall.\" Though Jordan initially rejects him, Rafe eventually gets her to open up. The turning point for the duo is when Rafe reacts badly to the lack of feedback from Jordan during a physical therapy session. Jordan finally understands that her encouragement could help his recovery, she lets her guard down.<ref name=\"TVL081413\"/> Jordan's professionalism becomes a problem when she starts to fall for Rafe. It is kind of a \"push-pull for Jordan,\" she said.<ref name=\"About.com121913\"/> She said Jordan is \"definitely scared of her feelings for Rafe,\" because it is unprofessional to fall for a patient. Rafe jokes about firing Jordan once he is recovered so they can date, and that is when she starts to let her guard down viewers would see the \"chemistry\" between the characters.<ref name=\"SSK121213\"/>\n\nHartley said that Jordan's dynamic with Kate becomes very \"antagonistic.\"<ref name=\"TVL081413\"/> According to the actress, Jordan finds Kate \"overbearing\" and initially doesn't \"give her a second thought.\" However, Jordan gets nervous when Kate starts digging into her past. Of the character's past, she said fans would need to be patient because the story about Jordan's past would take some time to come out. \"Obviously some things have happened that she needs to run from or that she is afraid of.\" When Jordan's feelings for Rafe evolve, Jordan becomes much more vulnerable. She revealed to ''Soaps She Knows'' that \"We will see that dynamic come into play where even though she acts like she is not afraid of Kate, we will see that she is slightly afraid of the fact that Kate was able to pull up some stuff from the past and how it could affect her life.\" <ref name=\"SSK121213\"/>\n\nWith the casting of Jade Harlow in the recurring role of Sheryl, the show began developing and exploring the character's background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2014/01/update-on-jade-harlows-days-character-and-first-airdate|title=UPDATE on Jade Harlow's 'DAYS' Character and First Airdate|work=Soap Opera Network|first=Errol|last=Lewis|date=January 3, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> In February 2014, it was announced that country singer [[Justin Gaston]] had been cast as Jordan's brother, [[Ben Rogers (Days of our Lives)|Ben Rogers]], with whom she shares a secret past.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Errol|title= Country Music Singer/Actor Justin Gaston Joins 'Days of our Lives' In Contract Role |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2014/02/country-music-singeractor-justin-gaston-joins-days-of-our-lives-in-contract-role|work=Soap Opera Network|accessdate=February 6, 2014|date=February 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Storylines ==\nJordan arrived in [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]] in mid-August 2013, per the request of Kate Roberts (Koslow) to help rehabilitate Rafe Hernandez (Gering), following his being attacked.<ref name=\"August 15, 2013\"/><ref name=\"8/15/2013\"/> Originally very guarded and off-putting, Jordan begins to let down her walls around Rafe, much to the chagrin of Kate.

At her apartment, she opens a lockbox only to reveal several I.D.'s with different names, all featuring various looks.<ref name=\"December 4, 2013\"/><ref name=\"12/4/2013\"/> As Jordan begins to develop a relationship with Rafe, Jordan's old friend Sheryl (Jade Harlow) from [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] arrives in town in early 2014, and immediately begins to stir up Jordan's past by connecting with Kate, Rafe, [[Sami Brady]] ([[Alison Sweeney]]) and [[Lucas Roberts|Lucas Horton]] ([[Bryan Dattilo]]). Jordan and Sheryl then enter into a conflict, over Sheryl's arrival into town; however both ladies agree to make the best of their rekindled friendship. Kate then involves Lucas in her scheme against Jordan, and during a night out, Kate breaks into Jordan's apartment and discovers her box of hidden I.D.'s; Kate is then caught when Jordan arrives back early.<ref name=\"February 7, 2014\"/><ref name=\"2/07/2014\"/><ref name=\"February 7, 2014 (Soaps She Knows)\"/> Following her step-father's arrival into town, Rafe and Jordan soon separate and she eventually falls for town bad boy, [[Chad DiMera]] ([[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]).

She returned in early 2019 briefly, keeping Ciara Brady and Charlotte DiMera hostage to protect them from changed Ben and pointing all the evidences to him. She is then admitted to the mental asylum, Bayview. During her treatment in Bayview, she reveals a secret to Rafe about giving birth to a child who she named David Ridgeway, giving him the responsibly of looking after her son in her absence.\n\n== Reception ==\nStause's teasing led to much fan speculation on [[Twitter]] about what soap she would join.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2013/04/18/chrishell-stause-joins-days-of-our-lives|title=Chrishell Stause Joins Days of Our Lives!|first=Jillian|last=Bowe|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|accessdate=February 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217134922/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2013/04/18/chrishell-stause-joins-days-of-our-lives|archive-date=February 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Things will undoubtedly heat up in Salem this summer,\" Matt Webb Mitovitch said of the casting announcement.<ref name=\"TVL041813\"/> Kambra Clifford of ''Soap Opera Network'' was very happy about the casting, and announced the news with headline, \"Chrishell Stause Is Baaaaack!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2013/04/chrishell-stause-is-baaaaack|title=Chrishell Stause Is Baaaaack!|work=Soap Opera Network|date=April 18, 2013|first=Kambra|last=Clifford|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Michael Fairman said Stause's debut was greatly anticipated by viewers and critics.<ref name=\"OAOS062713\"/> Matt Webb Mitovitch compared the character to the ''[[General Hospital]]'' characters of [[Lucy Coe]] ([[Lynn Herring]]) and [[Sabrina Santiago]] ([[Teresa Castillo]]) and ''Days's'' own, [[Chloe Lane]] ([[Nadia Bjorlin]]) due to her introduction as the \"ugly duckling.\" Webb Mitovitch described Jordan as having an \"icy demeanor.\"<ref name=\"TVL081413\"/> \"Now the kicker is, Stause is going to be dressed down for the role, no bombshell gowns, or glamor for now!

The truce had the sanction of Mohammad Daud, the governor of Helmand province, and most tribal elders, who felt they could now exercise control over the Taliban themselves. It was also seen as a move to help integrate the local Pashtun tribes on the side of the US-allied government. Others however, saw the move as a [[wikt:cop-out|cop-out]]; Lieutenant-General [[David Richards (general)|David Richards]], the [[NATO]] commander in Afghanistan at the time, said that this move turned these four centers into \"magnets\" for the Taliban insurgents.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2383232,00.html \n|title = British troops in secret truce with the Taliban\n|author = Michael Smith\n|publisher = The Times, London (Sunday Times)\n|date = 2006-10-01\n|accessdate = 2007-02-04}}\n</ref>\n\nInitially, the local leaders were happy with the settlement, which gave them the upper hand over the Taliban.

Richards tried to create a less harsh, more economic-development-oriented identity for NATO in Afghanistan, as compared to the \u2018\u2018kicking-down-doors\u2019\u2019 image that US forces have. Many local analysts expect NATO forces to embrace a more aggressive stance under McNeill, who is believed to oppose the type of local peace arrangements that Richards promoted. The danger at this point is that an overly aggressive NATO force in Afghanistan could alienate Afghans, and thus cause the Taliban\u2019s support base to grow.\"''\n\nThe district was the scene of heavy fighting in late July 2007 after ISAF forces attacked several rebel hideouts in [[Helmand Province]]. Coalition officials said that up to 160 Taliban fighters were killed between 22 July and 26 July in gun battles and air strikes, adding that, rather than avoiding battle, the Taliban were trying to defend the area. No civilian casualties were reported by ISAF, although a self-described resident claimed by phone that 16 civilians were killed in an air strike.\n\nIn October 2007, [[Reuters]] reported that ISAF troops and [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF) had killed 80 Taliban insurgents in a six-hour battle there. As with the July engagement, the Taliban concentrated their forces and fought to defend the region rather than using typical \"[[shoot and scoot]]\" tactics.<ref name=\"Reuters20071028\">{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/world/international-afghan-violence.html|title = 80 Taliban Reported Killed in Afghanistan|publisher = Reuters|date = 2007-10-28|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512071611/http://www10.nytimes.com/reuters/world/international-afghan-violence.html|archivedate = 2008-05-12}} </ref>\n\n==Battle of Musa Qala==\n{{main|Battle of Musa Qala}}\nAs of 7 December 2007, an alleged 2000 Taliban rebels occupied Musa Qala.

Their mission was to assist in seizing the town and to help IAF forces train the [[Afghan National Police]]. They met heavy opposition and had several very intense firefights within days of arriving and throughout the coming months, but were aggressive and quick in their tactics resulting them pushing the offensive further and further out of the town.\n\nIn mid-2008 the Afghan police had completed their training, were strategically placed throughout the town and its entrances, and mentored with constant supervision and even conducted security patrols and combat operations alongside ISAF forces. After months of training and fighting with many firefights sometimes exceeding 6 hours, the town of Musa Qala was significantly quieter and more peaceful than it had been prior to the U.S Marines arrival.\n\nIn August 2008 a detachment of Marines left Musa Qala to assist in the taking over of Taliban headquarters in the Helmand province in a sister town called [[Nawzad, Afghanistan|Nawzad]]. The town was used by the Taliban as a safe haven while they were not in Musa Qala and had been completely abandoned by all Afghan civilians due to Taliban presence. In Nawzad the Marines successfully drove the three to four hundred Taliban out with heavy airstrikes and ground forces in just over 14 hours. The Marines did not have the resources to hold the Taliban headquarters and had to return to base, which resulted in the Taliban returning several days later.\n\n==Additional notes==\nIn memory of a prior conflict, in 2006, involving the British [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]], a new Regimental March, composed by Chris Attrill and commissioned by [[Larne Borough Council]], was given to the regiment on Saturday 1 November 2008 in [[Larne]], [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]] during an event in which the regiment was presented with the 'Freedom of the Borough'. This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. The March was named, 'Musa Qala'.<ref>[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/New-march-to-be-gifted.4651277.jp Freedom of the Borough]</ref>\n\n<!--<nowiki>See [WP:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags</nowiki>-->\n==See also==\n* [[Helmand Province]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Helmand Province]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->\n|name                   = Musa Qala\n|native_name            =  \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0644\u0627\n|settlement_type        =Town\n<!-- images and maps  ----------->\n|image_skyline          = USMC-101130-M-0901H-068.jpg\n|imagesize              = 250px\n|image_caption          = [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) patrolling alongside U.S. Marines in Musa Qala (2010)\n|image_flag             = \n|flag_size              =\n|image_seal             = \n|seal_size              =\n|image_shield           =\n|shield_size            =\n|image_blank_emblem     =\n|blank_emblem_type      =\n|blank_emblem_size      =\n|image_map              = \n|mapsize                = \n|map_caption            = \n|pushpin_map            = Afghanistan\n|pushpin_label_position = above\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Afghanistan\n<!-- Location ------------------>\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = {{flag|Afghanistan}}\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Afghanistan|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Helmand Province]]\n|subdivision_type2      = [[Districts of Afghanistan|District]]\n|subdivision_name2      =[[Musa Qala District]]\n|subdivision_type3      = \n|subdivision_name3      = \n|subdivision_type4      = \n|subdivision_name4      =\n| parts_type            = Occupation\n| parts_style           = para\n| p1                    = [[File:Flag of Taliban.svg|25px]] [[Taliban]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Life under Taliban in Afghanistan - BBC News |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk3ZN7YXUro |website=Youtube |publisher=BBC News |accessdate= April 2 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Graham-Harrison |first1=Emma |title=Musa Qala is small military victory for Taliban but big propaganda boost |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/taliban-recaptures-high-profile-helmand-town-musa-qala |website=The Guardian |accessdate= April 2 2020}}</ref>\n<!-- Politics ----------------->\n|government_footnotes   =\n|government_type        =\n|leader_title           =\n|leader_name            =\n|established_title      =\n|established_date       = \n<!-- Area    --------------------->\n|area_magnitude         = \n|unit_pref                = \n|area_footnotes           =\n<!-- ALL fields dealing with a measurements are subject to automatic unit conversion-->\n|area_land_km2            = <!--See table @ Template:Infobox Settlement for details on automatic unit conversion-->\n|area_water_km2           =\n|area_total_sq_mi         =\n|area_land_sq_mi          =\n|area_water_sq_mi         =\n|area_water_percent       =\n|area_metro_km2           =\n|area_metro_sq_mi         =\n<!-- Population   ----------------------->\n|population_as_of               = \n|population_footnotes           = \n|population_note                = \n|population_total               =\n|population_density_km2         =\n|population_density_sq_mi       =\n|population_metro               =\n|population_density_metro_km2   =\n|population_density_metro_sq_mi =\n|population_urban               =\n|population_density_urban_km2   =\n|population_density_urban_sq_mi =\n<!-- General information  --------------->\n|timezone               =Afghanistan Standard Time\n|utc_offset             = +4:30\n|timezone_DST           = \n|utc_offset_DST         = \n|coordinates            = {{coord|32|26|35.88|N|64|44|39.84|E|region:AF|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    =  <!--for references: use <ref> </ref> tags-->\n|elevation_m            =1043\n|elevation_ft           =\n<!-- Area/postal codes & others -------->\n|postal_code_type       = <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            =\n|area_code              =\n|blank_name             =\n|blank_info             =\n|blank1_name            =\n|blank1_info            =\n|website                = \n|footnotes              =\n}}\n\n'''Musa Qala''' ({{lang-ps|\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0644\u0627\n}}; \"Fortress of [[Moses]]\")<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4333805.ece Times online - Bungs and bungling in Musa Qala: (15 July 2008)]</ref> is a town and the district centre of [[Musa Qala District]] in [[Helmand Province]], [[Afghanistan]].

The truce had the sanction of Mohammad Daud, the governor of Helmand province, and most tribal elders, who felt they could now exercise control over the Taliban themselves. It was also seen as a move to help integrate the local Pashtun tribes on the side of the US-allied government.

Many local analysts expect NATO forces to embrace a more aggressive stance under McNeill, who is believed to oppose the type of local peace arrangements that Richards promoted. The danger at this point is that an overly aggressive NATO force in Afghanistan could alienate Afghans, and thus cause the Taliban\u2019s support base to grow.\"''\n\nThe district was the scene of heavy fighting in late July 2007 after ISAF forces attacked several rebel hideouts in [[Helmand Province]]. Coalition officials said that up to 160 Taliban fighters were killed between 22 July and 26 July in gun battles and air strikes, adding that, rather than avoiding battle, the Taliban were trying to defend the area. No civilian casualties were reported by ISAF, although a self-described resident claimed by phone that 16 civilians were killed in an air strike.\n\nIn October 2007, [[Reuters]] reported that ISAF troops and [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF) had killed 80 Taliban insurgents in a six-hour battle there.

They met heavy opposition and had several very intense firefights within days of arriving and throughout the coming months, but were aggressive and quick in their tactics resulting them pushing the offensive further and further out of the town.\n\nIn mid-2008 the Afghan police had completed their training, were strategically placed throughout the town and its entrances, and mentored with constant supervision and even conducted security patrols and combat operations alongside ISAF forces. After months of training and fighting with many firefights sometimes exceeding 6 hours, the town of Musa Qala was significantly quieter and more peaceful than it had been prior to the U.S Marines arrival.\n\nIn August 2008 a detachment of Marines left Musa Qala to assist in the taking over of Taliban headquarters in the Helmand province in a sister town called [[Nawzad, Afghanistan|Nawzad]]. The town was used by the Taliban as a safe haven while they were not in Musa Qala and had been completely abandoned by all Afghan civilians due to Taliban presence. In Nawzad the Marines successfully drove the three to four hundred Taliban out with heavy airstrikes and ground forces in just over 14 hours. The Marines did not have the resources to hold the Taliban headquarters and had to return to base, which resulted in the Taliban returning several days later.\n\n==Additional notes==\nIn memory of a prior conflict, in 2006, involving the British [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]], a new Regimental March, composed by Chris Attrill and commissioned by [[Larne Borough Council]], was given to the regiment on Saturday 1 November 2008 in [[Larne]], [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]] during an event in which the regiment was presented with the 'Freedom of the Borough'. This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. The March was named, 'Musa Qala'.<ref>[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/New-march-to-be-gifted.4651277.jp Freedom of the Borough]</ref>\n\n<!--<nowiki>See [WP:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags</nowiki>-->\n==See also==\n* [[Helmand Province]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Helmand Province]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Commas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_Qala"}

Introduced in September 1990, she was portrayed by several child actors until the character left the series in 1992, with further guest appearances in both 1996 and 1997. The character was reintroduced to the series in July 2013, under the portrayal of actress [[Jen Lilley]], best known for her portrayal of [[Maxie Jones]] on ''[[General Hospital]]'', and departed in November 2016. Lilley reprised the role in May 2018 for a three-month stint, departing again in July.\n\nTheresa is the daughter of [[supercouple]] Shane Donovan and Kimberly Brady ([[Charles Shaughnessy]] and, most prominently, [[Patsy Pease]]). With the casting of Lilley in the role, the character entered her first major story line, opposite Casey Moss who portrays [[JJ Deveraux]].\n\n== Casting ==\n[[File:Jen Lilley 2012.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Lilley's temporary portrayal of [[Maxie Jones]] on ''[[General Hospital]]'' caught the eye of executive producer [[Ken Corday]] and other executives at ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', which led to her audition for Theresa.]]\nIn April 2013, it was announced by ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' and several other sources that [[Jen Lilley]] joined the cast of ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' in a newly created role with ties to the canvas.<ref name=\"EXCLUSIVE!

In an interview with ''[[MSN|MSN Entertainment]]'' on her role, Lilley spoke: \"Part of me doesn't want to make excuses for her, because you can have horrible upbringing and make something positive of it. Some of the most amazing, well-grounded people have come from the wrong side of the tracks. Obviously, the Brady-Donovan family is a great family, but her dad Shane is a spy and I watched the episode where he leaves the kids with Kimberly. Theresa was probably one, at most, so she didn't have a dad growing up, which is a formula for trouble. Typical psychological path for a girl like that is to look for love in the wrong places and look for a father figure in older guys.\"<ref name=\"Jen Lilley Q&A\"/> The role of Theresa has been described as \"sarcastic, calculating, mischievous\" and \"mysterious\".<ref name=\"Theresa Donovan Quick Profile\"/> Lilley also called her \"such a badass\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=A day in the life of\u2026 Jen Lilley|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=January 2015|url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/soap-extra/articles/2015/1/a-day-in-the-life-of%E2%80%A6-jen-lilley/|accessdate=March 7, 2015|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|width    = 30em\n|border   = 1px\n|align    = right\n|bgcolor  = #FAE7B5\n|fontsize = 88%\n|quote    = \"Ugh, it's such a blessing.

At the time, she was hoping to book the \"good girl\" role; however for her second audition, was asked to amp it up to a more bad girl persona and concentrate on Theresa. She revealed: \"I got to skip the first audition, which is called a pre-read and is an audition to audition. So then I auditioned with everyone else, and I got to do my screen test twice, which is very unusual. I was the only girl who got to do that, so I went first and last. The reason they had me do it twice is that I wore my hair curly, and I have a really young face, and they said that I looked too sweet and innocent and young with the curly hair. So they straightened my hair and had me do it again. On the second take, I knew that I had nothing to lose. I had already done a perfect first take, and they told me it wasn't going to get better than that so I could do whatever I wanted. I just did everything out of the box, and that's what got me the job. I mean I took the guy's shirt off in the scene! I told the actor that this is a character with no concept of personal space, so I asked him if it's ok if I touch him. He said that was fine and it was my screen test. So I took his shirt off and I threw some props at him at the end. I broke all the rules, and I think [the casting staff] thought, that is that character.\"<ref name=\"Daytime Royalty Interview\"/>\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n=== Backstory ===\nJeannie Theresa Donovan was born on September 3, 1990, to [[Kimberly Brady]] ([[Patsy Pease]]) and was originally believed to be the daughter of Cal Winter.{{efn|During Cal's duration with the series, he was portrayed by two actors: [[Wortham Krimmer]] (1989\u201390) and [[Joseph Bottoms]] (1991).}}<ref name=\"The Soaps\"/> However, paternity tests  and a confession from Cal proved her father to be [[Shane Donovan]] ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]). She grew up with her parents in Salem, before relocating to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"On the Soapbox\"/><ref name=\"Speaking of Soaps\"/>\n\n=== 2013\u20132018 ===\nIn July 2013, Jeannie returns to Salem, this time going by her middle name, Theresa. Initially, she strikes up a connection with resident bad boy [[JJ Deveraux]] (Casey Moss) while trying to secure some [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]].<ref name=\"July 3, 2013\"/> During a confrontation with JJ and his mother [[Jennifer Horton]] ([[Melissa Reeves]]) in her office, her aunt Kayla confirms that Theresa is in fact Jeannie and that Jen promised to hire her as her assistant, a promise she reluctantly agrees to. Kayla reminds Theresa it is her last chance at a fresh start.<ref name=\"July 9, 2013\"/> Theresa also strikes up a bad first impression with Jennifer's daughter [[Abigail Deveraux]] ([[Kate Mansi]]) when Abigail smells pot on Theresa in her mother's office.<ref name=\"July 18, 2013\"/> To continue to battle against Jennifer, she teams up with Anne Milbauer ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]) in hopes of exacting her perfect revenge. In a ploy, Theresa reveals her intentions to hopefully woo [[Daniel Jonas|Dr. Daniel Jonas]] ([[Shawn Christian]]). After sleeping with JJ, Theresa overdoses on marijuana and [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. Upon hearing of their daughter's overdose and continuing problems, Shane and Kimberly return to town in the hopes of handling their daughter's problem, together. After believing that Theresa has a handle on her addictions, Shane and Kimberly leave town together. Theresa then teams up with hospital co-worker Anne Milbauer ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]) to conspire against Jennifer, using Daniel as a way to hurt their relationship. In early 2014, following a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] (NA) meeting, she begins a sexual and drugged-fused relationship with [[Brady Black]] ([[Eric Martsolf]]). In 2015, after it is found that [[Kristen DiMera]] ([[Eileen Davidson]]) stole Theresa's embryo and carried it to term, Brady and [[Melanie Jonas]] return her son, Christopher, to her and Brady, and the pair rename him Tate. When Theresa moves into the Kiriakis mansion, tensions arise between her and [[Victor Kiriakis|Victor]]. She eventually expresses her interest in purchasing Basic Black and running it as her own fashion company, with financial backing from [[Maggie Horton]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]). In the hopes of finding the right partner, she teams up with [[Kate Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] ([[Lauren Koslow]]) and [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]) to achieve the goal of purchasing Basic Black, with Kate and Nicole's business background and her own interest in [[fashion design]]. As she and Brady share several instances of rekindling their romance, she is kicked out of the mansion by Victor; as a result, Brady quits Titan and moves in with Theresa and Tate, in their own penthouse.\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon the news of Lilley joining the cast, Michael Fairman of ''On-Air On-Soaps'' credited her casting as, \"fantastic news for [Jen Lilley] fans\".<ref name=\"Jen Lilley Joins The Cast of Days Of Our Lives!

Introduced in September 1990, she was portrayed by several child actors until the character left the series in 1992, with further guest appearances in both 1996 and 1997. The character was reintroduced to the series in July 2013, under the portrayal of actress [[Jen Lilley]], best known for her portrayal of [[Maxie Jones]] on ''[[General Hospital]]'', and departed in November 2016. Lilley reprised the role in May 2018 for a three-month stint, departing again in July.\n\nTheresa is the daughter of [[supercouple]] Shane Donovan and Kimberly Brady ([[Charles Shaughnessy]] and, most prominently, [[Patsy Pease]]). With the casting of Lilley in the role, the character entered her first major story line, opposite Casey Moss who portrays [[JJ Deveraux]].\n\n== Casting ==\n[[File:Jen Lilley 2012.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Lilley's temporary portrayal of [[Maxie Jones]] on ''[[General Hospital]]'' caught the eye of executive producer [[Ken Corday]] and other executives at ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', which led to her audition for Theresa.]]\nIn April 2013, it was announced by ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' and several other sources that [[Jen Lilley]] joined the cast of ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' in a newly created role with ties to the canvas.<ref name=\"EXCLUSIVE!

In an interview with ''[[MSN|MSN Entertainment]]'' on her role, Lilley spoke: \"Part of me doesn't want to make excuses for her, because you can have horrible upbringing and make something positive of it. Some of the most amazing, well-grounded people have come from the wrong side of the tracks. Obviously, the Brady-Donovan family is a great family, but her dad Shane is a spy and I watched the episode where he leaves the kids with Kimberly. Theresa was probably one, at most, so she didn't have a dad growing up, which is a formula for trouble. Typical psychological path for a girl like that is to look for love in the wrong places and look for a father figure in older guys.\"<ref name=\"Jen Lilley Q&A\"/> The role of Theresa has been described as \"sarcastic, calculating, mischievous\" and \"mysterious\".<ref name=\"Theresa Donovan Quick Profile\"/> Lilley also called her \"such a badass\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=A day in the life of\u2026 Jen Lilley|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=January 2015|url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/soap-extra/articles/2015/1/a-day-in-the-life-of%E2%80%A6-jen-lilley/|accessdate=March 7, 2015|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|width    = 30em\n|border   = 1px\n|align    = right\n|bgcolor  = #FAE7B5\n|fontsize = 88%\n|quote    = \"Ugh, it's such a blessing.

At the time, she was hoping to book the \"good girl\" role; however for her second audition, was asked to amp it up to a more bad girl persona and concentrate on Theresa. She revealed: \"I got to skip the first audition, which is called a pre-read and is an audition to audition. So then I auditioned with everyone else, and I got to do my screen test twice, which is very unusual. I was the only girl who got to do that, so I went first and last. The reason they had me do it twice is that I wore my hair curly, and I have a really young face, and they said that I looked too sweet and innocent and young with the curly hair. So they straightened my hair and had me do it again. On the second take, I knew that I had nothing to lose. I had already done a perfect first take, and they told me it wasn't going to get better than that so I could do whatever I wanted. I just did everything out of the box, and that's what got me the job. I mean I took the guy's shirt off in the scene! I told the actor that this is a character with no concept of personal space, so I asked him if it's ok if I touch him. He said that was fine and it was my screen test. So I took his shirt off and I threw some props at him at the end. I broke all the rules, and I think [the casting staff] thought, that is that character.\"<ref name=\"Daytime Royalty Interview\"/>\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n=== Backstory ===\nJeannie Theresa Donovan was born on September 3, 1990, to [[Kimberly Brady]] ([[Patsy Pease]]) and was originally believed to be the daughter of Cal Winter.{{efn|During Cal's duration with the series, he was portrayed by two actors: [[Wortham Krimmer]] (1989\u201390) and [[Joseph Bottoms]] (1991).}}<ref name=\"The Soaps\"/> However, paternity tests  and a confession from Cal proved her father to be [[Shane Donovan]] ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]). She grew up with her parents in [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]], before relocating to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"On the Soapbox\"/><ref name=\"Speaking of Soaps\"/>\n\n=== 2013\u20132018 ===\nIn July 2013, Jeannie returns to Salem, this time going by her middle name, Theresa. Initially, she strikes up a connection with resident bad boy [[JJ Deveraux]] (Casey Moss) while trying to secure some [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]].<ref name=\"July 3, 2013\"/> During a confrontation with JJ and his mother [[Jennifer Horton]] ([[Melissa Reeves]]) in her office, her aunt Kayla confirms that Theresa is in fact Jeannie and that Jen promised to hire her as her assistant, a promise she reluctantly agrees to. Kayla reminds Theresa it is her last chance at a fresh start.<ref name=\"July 9, 2013\"/> Theresa also strikes up a bad first impression with Jennifer's daughter [[Abigail Deveraux]] ([[Kate Mansi]]) when Abigail smells pot on Theresa in her mother's office.<ref name=\"July 18, 2013\"/> To continue to battle against Jennifer, she teams up with Anne Milbauer ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]) in hopes of exacting her perfect revenge. In a ploy, Theresa reveals her intentions to hopefully woo [[Daniel Jonas|Dr. Daniel Jonas]] ([[Shawn Christian]]). After sleeping with JJ, Theresa overdoses on marijuana and [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. Upon hearing of their daughter's overdose and continuing problems, Shane and Kimberly return to town in the hopes of handling their daughter's problem, together. After believing that Theresa has a handle on her addictions, Shane and Kimberly leave town together. Theresa then teams up with hospital co-worker Anne Milbauer ([[Meredith Scott Lynn]]) to conspire against Jennifer, using Daniel as a way to hurt their relationship. In early 2014, following a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] (NA) meeting, she begins a sexual and drugged-fused relationship with [[Brady Black]] ([[Eric Martsolf]]). In 2015, after it is found that [[Kristen DiMera]] ([[Eileen Davidson]]) stole Theresa's embryo and carried it to term, Brady and [[Melanie Jonas]] return her son, Christopher, to her and Brady, and the pair rename him Tate. When Theresa moves into the Kiriakis mansion, tensions arise between her and [[Victor Kiriakis|Victor]]. She eventually expresses her interest in purchasing Basic Black and running it as her own fashion company, with financial backing from [[Maggie Horton]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]). In the hopes of finding the right partner, she teams up with [[Kate Roberts (Days of Our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] ([[Lauren Koslow]]) and [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]) to achieve the goal of purchasing Basic Black, with Kate and Nicole's business background and her own interest in [[fashion design]]. As she and Brady share several instances of rekindling their romance, she is kicked out of the mansion by Victor; as a result, Brady quits Titan and moves in with Theresa and Tate, in their own penthouse.\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon the news of Lilley joining the cast, Michael Fairman of ''On-Air On-Soaps'' credited her casting as, \"fantastic news for [Jen Lilley] fans\".<ref name=\"Jen Lilley Joins The Cast of Days Of Our Lives!
