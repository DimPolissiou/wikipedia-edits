A [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]], Stapleton played 15 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA), most notably for the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]].  He is the father of [[Mike Stapleton]], who had a lengthy career in the NHL as well.\n\n==Playing career==\n[[File:Patrick Stapleton, February 2012.jpeg|thumb|right|Pat Stapleton in Moscow at a meeting of participants of the [[1972 Summit Series]], February 24, 2012.]]\nStapleton played Junior B hockey with the [[Sarnia Legionnaires (1954\u20131970)|Sarnia Legionnaires]] before spending two seasons with the [[St. Catharines Teepees]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], winning the [[Memorial Cup]] in 1960. With the Legionnaires he won two Western Jr. 'B' championships and one Sutherland Cup as an all-Ontario champion. Although he was a defenceman, he led the Legionnaires in scoring during his second season.\n\nHis first full season was with the [[Sault Thunderbirds]] of the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (1959-1963)|Eastern Professional Hockey League]] in 1960\u201361. Stapleton had signed with the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], but was claimed by the [[Boston Bruins]] in the intra-league draft in June 1961 and began his [[National Hockey League]] career with the Bruins in the 1961\u201362 season. The next year, he split his time between Bruins and their EPHL affiliate, the [[Kingston Frontenacs (EPHL)|Kingston Frontenacs]]. Stapleton spent the next two years in the minor leagues, playing with the [[Portland Buckaroos]] of the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]]. He received the [[Hal Laycoe Cup]] as the WHL's top defenceman for the 1964\u201365 season.\n\nStapleton was briefly the property of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in June 1965 as part of a trade with the Bruins, but he was left unprotected in the intra-league draft and was claimed the next day by the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]]. Wearing number 7, he played some games with the Hawks' [[Central Hockey League (1963\u201384)|Central Hockey league]] affiliate, the [[St. Louis Braves]], in 1965\u201366, but they would be the final minor league games of his career. Stapleton remained in the NHL for eight seasons with the Black Hawks, and was named Second Team All-Star three times (1966, 1971, and 1972). Stapleton played with the Black Hawks in the Stanley Cup finals in 1971 and 1973.  His highest scoring season was 1969, where his 50 assists set a new NHL record for assists in a season by a defenceman (broken the next year by [[Bobby Orr]]).\n\nStapleton was a member of the Team Canada team at the [[Summit Series]] in 1972. During the tournament he was a +6 and was often paired with his Black Hawks teammate Bill White. It is believed that Stapleton is the owner of the puck used by [[Paul Henderson]] to score the series-winning goal. Stapleton himself admits that he doesn't know which one of the hundreds of pucks he owns is that game winning one, though it is in his possession.<ref>[http://www.1972summitseries.com/stapleton.html 1972summitseries.com], accessed February 2, 2007</ref> [https://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/nhl/canadian-teammate-finally-admits-he-has-the-puck-paul-henderson-scored-with-to-win-summit-series-or-does-he]\n\nIn 1973, Stapleton jumped from the NHL and signed a five-year deal with the  [[Chicago Cougars]] of the [[World Hockey Association]] where he became player-coach, replacing [[Marcel Pronovost]] as coach. He was a WHA first-team all-star in 1974 and won the [[Dennis A. Murphy Trophy]] as the league's top defenceman in the 1973\u201374 season.\n\nStapleton again represented Canada in the [[1974 Summit Series]] against the national team from the [[Soviet Union]], this time as team captain, recording three assists in eight games. He was again player-coach of the Cougars in 1974\u201375, and the team struggled on the ice and financially. In December 1974, he and teammates [[Dave Dryden]] and [[Ralph Backstrom]] bought the troubled franchise. At the time, Stapleton also owned two small arenas in the Chicago area along with other business interests.\n\nThe Cougars folded after the 1974\u201375 season and Stapleton was claimed by the [[Indianapolis Racers]], where he played for two seasons and was named a second-team all-star in 1976. When the Racers refused to honour his contract in 1977, Stapleton was transferred to the [[Cincinnati Stingers]], where he played one season before retiring in 1978. Over his career, Stapleton scored 337 points in the NHL and 239 in the WHA.\n\n==Post-playing career==\nStapleton lived in [[Strathroy-Caradoc|Strathroy]], [[Ontario]] and was a member of the advisory board of the Junior B [[Strathroy Rockets]] of the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League. He has a Strathroy and District Hockey Association award named after him.\n\nIn 2008, Stapleton brought the puck that Paul Henderson fired into the net to win the 1972 Summit Series with the Russians to a Sarnia Legionnaires game. He dropped it at a ceremonial faceoff being held to honour Legionnaire founder Tommy Norris. He told the Sarnia Observer that he had the puck on his stick when the buzzer sounded to end the series.

On 1 January 2013 the municipality of [[Guntmadingen]] merged into the municipality of Beringen.<ref name=Mutation>[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113231755/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html |date=13 November 2015 }} {{in lang|de}} accessed 9 February 2013</ref>\n\n==History==\nSwitzerland's history and Beringen's as well is linked back to the Ice Age and Stone Age. But, more specifically beginning with [[Helvetii|The Helvetians]], a Celtic tribe, give their name to the Swiss territory: hence HELVETIA on Swiss flags, coins and stamps, ch = Confoederatio Helvetica on cars and internet domains.\n\nThis is where the story and timeline of not only Swiss history but that of Berginen really begins, around 800 - 58 B.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/timeline-switzerlands-history.html|title=A Timeline of Switzerland's History|last=Switzerland|first=Markus G. Jud, Lucerne|website=history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Bronze Age===\nIn the [[Eschheimer]] Valley near Beringen, a gravesite had been discovered that is believed to reach back to the early [[Bronze Age]]. Several feet below the surface and covered by a layer of rocks, a skeleton was discovered, along with a bronze ax with a blade and dagger, as well as a decorative needle, a piece of wire, and several bronze nails. This grave was typical for the burial customs of the early Bronze Age.<ref>''History of the Canton of Schaffhausen'', 1901, p.37</ref>\n\n===Age of The Romans===\nThere is good evidence that a \"Hof\" (cluster of buildings) in the Lieblosen-Valley dates back to the time when the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] governed the territory, as can be seen by an ancient supporting wall embracing the living quarters and two economy buildings.\n\n\"When the Celtic Helvetians attempted to move south from Switzerland to Southern France they were stopped by the Roman commander and subsequent emperor C. Julius Cesar in 58 B.C. They were forced to return to Switzerland. The Romans controlled Switzerland's territory until about A.D. 400. Roman military camps and forts were erected at the northern Rhine frontier...\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/switzerland-age-romans.html|title=Switzerland in the Age of the Romans|last=Switzerland|first=Markus G. Jud, Lucerne|website=history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nA spectacular find was discovered when a military tile was unearthed showing the imprint of the 11th and 21st [[Roman legion|legion]] was well as the 26th [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]], indicating the presence of a corps of volunteers made up of Roman citizens.\n\nSimilar tiles have been found in Windisch, Bechtersbohl, and Baden-Baden. Further indications of a Roman presence is a complex of walls found near the Aasheimer-Hof in Beringen.<ref>''History of Canton of Shaffhausen'', 1901, p.45</ref>\n\n===Growth of Beringen===\nBeringen grew up along the creek that now runs through the village. The water drove mills in Beringen, such as the flour mill (no longer in operation), the gypsum mill (replaced by homes), and the so-called Oele (now the site of the municipal swimming pool). Water was needed for the dye-shops in the former Doktorhaus (house for Doctors, now a business establishment). Along the banks of the town creek, people washed everything, including pails, troughs, and related objects. The creek also served as drinking water for livestock, and was the only help in case of a fire.\n\nNaturally, the first settlers established themselves close to the creek, one house next to the other. Two rows of houses formed the original village. When fire consumed one of the houses, it was not replaced; instead, a building for public use was erected. This made it possible that six or more households could be supplied with water instead of only one or two. The best and best-preserved example of this is the Leunhof, a well-known restaurant. Others are the Huggehof, Chloesteril, Kellerhof, Vogelhof, and Paradieserhof, Prinzenhof, and the Winkel. The Chelhof stands close to the church and far away from the creek, next to the well.\n\nToday, Beringen's creek is now covered over. Water is supplied through an extensive system of pipes, large blocks for apartments and businesses have been erected, new buildings with small industries, and there are only a few agricultural buildings and outfits existing.\n\n===Beringen's History is in its Buildings===\nThere many notable old building that still exist in Beringen:\n\n* '''The Church of Beringen'''\nOne does not know the Patron Saint of this church, for sure. Possibly it can be Saint George who appears in an ancient coat of arms of Beringen. In a Chronicle of the historian, Rueger is a reference to a church in Beringen from the year 1061, but there is no official record until the year 1231. In 1580, an addition was built at the west end, and in 1642 an addition was constructed at the east end. In 1645, a tower was added, including a clock. New bells replaced the four old bells in 1906 and five years later an organ was installed. Two further renovations took place in 1965 and 1991. Residents continue to enjoy the steeple and sun clock.\n\n* '''The Parsonage of Beringen'''\nThe old residence of the village parson, across the street from the Huenen Castle, continues to serve as the center of the church congregation. Extensive remodeling and restoration has taken place over the years. The once beautiful, stately and historic Chestnut tree that used to adorned the premises was taken down in 1955, due to the realignment of the street.\n\n* '''Castle of the Huenen of Beringen Family (cica. 13th century)'''\nThe Huenen of Beringen family were aristocrats who built the Castles during the 13th century, and enlarged it in succeeding centuries. There is a drawing with a \"Legende\" or legend which indicates various parts were built and added in the 13th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.\n\nThrough the initiative of the Improvement Society for the castle of Beringen (today it's called the Beringen Castle Foundation), the entire castle was extensively restored so that various rooms and facilities have been used for the Museum of Beringen for historical folklore purposes, since 1989. The collection consists of items from the regions of Beringen, Guntmadingen, and Loehningen, and is a popular attraction for the village.\n\n* '''The Peradise-Estate (Monastery)'''\nThe monastery \"Paradice\", intent on enlarging its possessions, purchased in 1289 several parcels of land in Beringen. On July 11, 1291, Heinrich Ritter, a citizen of Schaffhausen, sold a large estate, called the \"Kehlhof\", to the monastery. Five years later, on December 20, 1296, Heinrich, the Pastor of Zurzach and Merishausen and his brother, Ulrich of Schaffhausen sold another estate in Beringen, \"The Bonstetten\", to the same Monastery.\n\nThe monastery was operated by nuns and within a few decades they managed to possess considerable acreage in Beringen. When Beringen was settled, the houses that had been built on these properties were called \"Paradieserhof\".\n\n* '''The MunggeHof'''\nA \"Hof\" consists of buildings, usually a dwelling, barn, livestock sheds and a shop. Hofs groupings were almost little worlds onto themselves.\n\nThe word, \"Mungge\" is the dialect term of \"Moench\", or the English equivalent Monks\". Others are the VogelHof, the Chehlhof, the Paradise-Hof and the Cellar-Hof, all of which are witnesses of the years when the monasteries owned and controlled large tracts of land and real estate, such as the Munggehoff.\n\nThe Munggehof served the community well, it was here where on the last Sunday of April that the annual \"Beringer-Chilbi\", or community folk festival was held. One of its features was a riding circle standing in the center of the square, while fringe fruits, bakery items, and other goodies were sold. Eventually, the square was too small for these festivals which are now held on the Fire-Square.\n\n* '''The VogelHof'''\nThe Vegelhof was one of the oldest parts of the village, and the houses were built very tightly together, the roofs extended far towards the front as protection against rain and sun. The entrances into the cellars were on the front side of the buildings, and wide stairways lead into the second floor of each house.\n\nVogel was the name of one of the families living there. Coopers, furniture builders, and stonemasons were established here. The last survivors of the Vogel family passed away in 1978.\n\n* '''The Lions Inn (circa. before 1711)'''\nIn Switzerland, many restaurants and hotels carry the name of an animal for identification ( examples: Lion, Bear, Eagle, etc.) Beringen's most famous restaurant was the \"Lion.\" It was first named in a historical record of 1711. Called a tavern or inn, the owner was obliged to affix to the building a very elaborate sign made of cast iron, depicting a lion.\n\nThe \"Lion\" served as the seat for the \"Society of Boys\" of Beringen. Such societies have existed since the 15th century. The one headquartered in the \"Lion\" is the only one existing in the Canton of Shauffhausen. This building is a large three story building which sits on a corner. Its front is decorated with ornate words and scrolled imagery along with an image of a lion and keeper. This image spans the entire front of the building, between the second and third floors.\n\nIn 1845, another organization was founded in the \"Lion\", an association of artisans and tradesmen, the \"Gewerbeverein\" It was the first association ever organized in Beringen. Its name was later changed to \"Reading Society\" (Leseverein), but was dissolved in 1960. Although the building was still standing in 2004, it was being used for apartments and a beauty salon, the restaurant and inn facilities were abandoned in the 1930s. The large Lion sign has been saved and adorns the staircase of the new and more modern community center \"Zelg\"\n \n* '''The Old School House (c. 1739)'''\nThe school house was built in 1826, and renovated in 1965. The square on which it stands was owned by the Monastery \"Allerheiligen\" (All Saints) which intended to initially be built as a barn to collect tithing. However, due to political and ecunemical changes, the barn was never build.\n\nThe original school house was built in 1739, however, there are no plans or pictures that remain to show its size or appearance. It was destroyed by fire in 1824, after it had served the village for 85 years. The first teacher was Hansjakob Huser, who served from 1608 to 1645.\n\nThe children from the neighboring village of Neuhausen, those in higher grades, attended school at the Beringen school house. At the time, Neuhausen was merely a small village of fishers and teamsters, and had no rooms for the higher grades.\n\nBy May 1949 a new school house was built-the third one; and it was dedicated to Zimmerberg, but 40 years later, it was already too small and a larger structure was in the planning stages. Because of the sharp increase in the student population, many were schooled in the old school house.\n\n* '''The Old Flour Mill (c. 1536)'''\nThe mill building is several hundred years old. It lies at the upper end of the village. Historically, it was first described in 1536; it belonged to the community as a whole and was leased back to some of the burghers every few years. Repairs and renovations took place in 1843 for the house, 1842 for the mill, and 1841 for the barn. The mill ceased operation decades ago, but the building is still used as a dwelling. Above the main door is the following engraved verse:\n\n        I mill my flour for everyone,\n        Good bread awaits him who can bake.\n        But, there is no miller in all the world \n        who can mill to satisfy everyone.\n\n* '''Der \"Gipsmuehle\" - The Gypsum Mill'''\nThis mill was owned for many generations by the Boll family. The water wheel was six meters (18 feet) high. The gypsum came from the nearby town of Schleitheim and was hauled first by a wagon with six horses, and then later by streetcars. When the material was unloaded in front of the mill, it was first burned in kilns seven feet high; the heavy smoke rose from many holes because it was impossible to build a chimney. The next process was to break the burned gypsum up into small pieces, and then to transfer it into the mill.\n\nAs long as the water was plentiful, the mill ran 24 hours a day. in 1900, 50 kilo of gypsum cost 70 cents; the price went up to four times as much by 1949. By this time, the mill suffered from old age; repairs and remodeling would have cost to much, and so its operation ceased. Today, it has been replaced by several apartment buildings.\n\n* '''The \"Old\" Post House'''\nFive or more generations ago, this building housed a bakery and restaurant as well as a post office. Every midnight, the postal coach would enter the village, coming from the distant town of Freiburg in Breisgau. Long before the coachman approached the Old Post House, he would sound his horn to alert the postmaster to bring his bag of mail out on the street, because the postal coach did not stop.\n\nThe first collection of mail took place in 1846, by a private contractor. Four years later, the mail service was federalized, and in 1862 Beringen received an official post office. In 1874, a telegraph unit was installed, and in 1946 the postal facilities were transferred to a larger building. In 1976, spacious offices were acquired in the community center, \"Zelg\".\n\n[[File:Wirtschaft zum Gemeindehaus in Beringen SH.jpg|thumb|Wirtschaft zum Gemeindehaus]]\n* '''Gemeindehaus Restaurant (Community House )'''\nIn December 1862 Johannes Schneider submitted to the meeting of the citizens a plan to build a public hall that would serve 300 people on tables. The hall was to be heated and complemented with additional rooms. As compensation, he expected not to have to pay any annual license fees for twenty years.\n\nThe answer of the village council was as follows: \n1. Permission would be granted, but a guard's room had to be added, and the premises needed to be used by the village council to house soldiers.\n\n2. Construction would have to be supervised by the village council.\n\n3. The council would pay for an annual fee of fifty francs (about $12.00) for lighting and heating.\n\n4. The owner would be exempt from paying the annual fees for the first twenty years.\n\n5. The building had to be built during the year 1863.\n\nIn near recent years some of the rooms have been remodeled into additional dinning facilities, a bakery shop, coffee shop, and a small garden with a garden restaurant.\n\n* '''The Eagle-House'''\nThis stately building was built in 1863, and was noted for its large roof. Along with several similar structures along the same route, the \"Schaffer-hauser Street\" was/is typical of the buildings built during the time when the first railroads were constructed. Among them was the Baumgarten-House, which was an exact duplication of the Eagle-House.\n\nAfter serving for more than 100 years, the Eagle-House was torn down in 1966, to make room for a super market. This was a rather unattractive building, and was nicknamed the \"shoebox\" by the local people. It was demolished after only 23 years, and the site is now occupied by a shopping center.\n\n* '''The Dalcher-Hueseli'''\nThe Dalcher-Huesli is an reminiscent of rural architecture in Beringen. \"Huesli\" is an endearing name for a small house, which normally had a barn with livestock stalls on the ground floor, and an apartment on the second floor for the servants. Behind the barn would be the living quarters for the owners. Unfortunately, the last Dalcher-Huesli was torn down to make room for a Kiosk and facilities for the public street car system (1964, a new public streetcar company (ASS) starts operation on October 1, replacing the old system of 19050.\n\n==Historical Timeline of Beringen==\n[[File:2006-10-30 10-25-34 Switzerland Zurich Andelfingen.jpg|thumb|Aerial view with surrounding villages and the Rhine.

In linguistic research the name \u201cBollo\u201d designates the family name, while the ending \u201cingen\u201d means children or people. The Bollinger were thus the children, or kin \u201cof the Bollo\u201d. Other surnames were similarly formed, such as Z\u00e4hringer, Merowinger, Zollinger, etc. In those times members of the Bollinger settled in different parts of today's Switzerland, such as Beringen, Canton Schaffhausen and some areas of Canton Aargau, the name often appearing as Bolliger. In the villages of Bolligen, Canton Bern and Bollingen at the upper part of Lake Zurich it led to the naming of these settlements. There now appears to be evidence of the family name dating back to 1362 with notification of the \"Sale of a Bollinger Farm: Buwet 1362\"\n\nThe first document about the Bollingers dates from 1362. The Turbenthal church books only start in 1529. The data for the Chronic of the Bollinger of Neubrunn for the time from 1362 to 1529 was gathered from the archives in of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Monastery of St. Gallen]], tax rolls of the town of Zurich, tax books and other sources to show who lived, and when, in Neubrunn.

Conrad Bollinger was from Beringen and his family line dates back to Hans Georg Bollinger (circa 1588, Ancestry.com) of Beringen. Conrad Bollinger was born on August 13, 1846, in Beringen, Schaffhausen, Switzerland, to Katharina Schaad, age 42, and Hans Jakob Bollinger, age 43. He emigrated to the US in 1865. He worked for the War Department in San Antonio, Texas and was living in Texas in 1870. He his family moved to Kings County, New York as he worked at Governors Island, and thereafter they moved to Montvale, New Jersey in 1910. Conrad Bollinger died on December 24, 1920, in Montvale, New Jersey, when he was 74 years old.

Further indications of a Roman presence is a complex of walls found near the Aasheimer-Hof in Beringen.<ref>''History of Canton of Shaffhausen'', 1901, p.45</ref>\n\n===Growth of Beringen===\nBeringen grew up along the creek that now runs though the village. The water drove mills in Beringen, such as the flour mill (no longer in operation), the gypsum mill (replaced by homes), and the so-called Oele (now the site of the municipal swimming pool). Water was needed for the dye-shops in the former Doktorhaus (house for Doctors, now a business establishment). Along the banks of the town creek, people washed everything, including pails, troughs, and related objects. The creek also served as drinking water for livestock, and was the only help in case of a fire.\n\nNaturally, the first settlers established themselves close to the creek, one house next to the other. Two rows of houses formed the original village. When fire consumed one of the houses, it was not replaced; instead, a building for public use was erected. This made it possible that six or more households could be supplied with water instead of only one or two. The best and best-preserved example of this is the Leunhof, a well-known restaurant. Others are the Huggehof, Chloesteril, Kellerhof, Vogelhof, and Paradieserhof, Prinzenhof, and the Winkel. The Chelhof stands close to the church and far away from the creek, next to the well.\n\nToday, Beringen's creek is now covered over. Water is supplied through an extensive system of pipes, large blocks for apartments and businesses have been erected, new buildings with small industries, and there are only a few agricultural buildings and outfits existing.\n\n===Beringen's History is in its Buildings===\nThere many notable old building that still exist in Beringen:\n\n* '''The Church of Beringen'''\nOne does not know the Patron Saint of this church, for sure. Possibly it can be Saint George who appears in an ancient coat of arms of Beringen. In a Chronicle of the historian, Rueger is a reference to a church in Beringen from the year 1061, but there is no official record until the year 1231. In 1580, an addition was built at the west end, and in 1642 an addition was constructed at the east end. In 1645, a tower was added, including a clock. New bells replaced the four old bells in 1906 and five years later an organ was installed. Two further renovations took place in 1965 and 1991. Residents continue to enjoy the steeple and sun clock.\n\n* '''The Parsonage of Beringen'''\nThe old residence of the village parson, across the street from the Huenen Castle, continues to serve as the center of the church congregation. Extensive remodeling and restoration has taken place over the years. The once beautiful, stately and historic Chestnut tree that used to adorned the premises was taken down in 1955, due to the realignment of the street.\n\n* '''Castle of the Huenen of Beringen Family (cica. 13th century)'''\nThe Huenen of Beringen family were aristocrats who built the Castles during the 13th century, and enlarged it in succeeding centuries. There is a drawing with a \"Legende\" or legend which indicates various parts were built and added in the 13th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.\n\nThrough the initiative of the Improvement Society for the castle of Beringen (today it's called the Beringen Castle Foundation), the entire castle was extensively restored so that various rooms and facilities have been used for the Museum of Beringen for historical folklore purposes, since 1989. The collection consists of items from the regions of Beringen, Guntmadingen, and Loehningen, and is a popular attraction for the village.\n\n* '''The Peradise-Estate (Monastery)'''\nThe monastery \"Paradice\", intent on enlarging its possessions, purchased in 1289 several parcels of land in Beringen. On July 11, 1291, Heinrich Ritter, a citizen of Schaffhausen, sold a large estate, called the \"Kehlhof\", to the monastery. Five years later, on December 20, 1296, Heinrich, the Pastor of Zurzach and Merishausen and his brother, Ulrich of Schaffhausen sold another estate in Beringen, \"The Bonstetten\", to the same Monastery.\n\nThe monastery was operated by nuns and within a few decades they managed to possess considerable acreage in Beringen. When Beringen was settled, the houses that had been built on these properties were called \"Paradieserhof\".\n\n* '''The MunggeHof'''\nA \"Hof\" consists of buildings, usually a dwelling, barn, livestock sheds and a shop. Hofs groupings were almost little worlds onto themselves.\n\nThe word, \"Mungge\" is the dialect term of \"Moench\", or the English equivalent Monks\". Others are the VogelHof, the Chehlhof, the Paradise-Hof and the Cellar-Hof, all of which are witnesses of the years when the monasteries owned and controlled large tracts of land and real estate, such as the Munggehoff.\n\nThe Munggehof served the community well, it was here where on the last Sunday of April that the annual \"Beringer-Chilbi\", or community folk festival was held. One of its features was a riding circle standing in the center of the square, while fringe fruits, bakery items, and other goodies were sold. Eventually, the square was too small for these festivals which are now held on the Fire-Square.\n\n* '''The VogelHof'''\nThe Vegelhof was one of the oldest parts of the village, and the houses were built very tightly together, the roofs extended far towards the front as protection against rain and sun. The entrances into the cellars were on the front side of the buildings, and wide stairways lead into the second floor of each house.\n\nVogel was the name of one of the families living there. Coopers, furniture builders, and stonemasons were established here. The last survivors of the Vogel family passed away in 1978.\n\n* '''The Lions Inn (circa. before 1711)'''\nIn Switzerland, many restaurants and hotels carry the name of an animal for identification ( examples: Lion, Bear, Eagle, etc.) Beringen's most famous restaurant was the \"Lion.\" It was first named in a historical record of 1711. Called a tavern or inn, the owner was obliged to affix to the building a very elaborate sign made of cast iron, depicting a lion.\n\nThe \"Lion\" served as the seat for the \"Society of Boys\" of Beringen. Such societies have existed since the 15th century. The one headquartered in the \"Lion\" is the only one existing in the Canton of Shauffhausen. This building is a large three story building which sits on a corner. Its front is decorated with ornate words and scrolled imagery along with an image of a lion and keeper. This image spans the entire front of the building, between the second and third floors.\n\nIn 1845, another organization was founded in the \"Lion\", an association of artisans and tradesmen, the \"Gewerbeverein\" It was the first association ever organized in Beringen. Its name was later changed to \"Reading Society\" (Leseverein), but was dissolved in 1960. Although the building was still standing in 2004, it was being used for apartments and a beauty salon, the restaurant and inn facilities were abandoned in the 1930s. The large Lion sign has been saved and adorns the staircase of the new and more modern community center \"Zelg\"\n \n* '''The Old School House (c. 1739)'''\nThe school house was built in 1826, and renovated in 1965. The square on which it stands was owned by the Monastery \"Allerheiligen\" (All Saints) which intended to initially be built as a barn to collect tithing. However, due to political and ecunemical changes, the barn was never build.\n\nThe original school house was built in 1739, however, there are no plans or pictures that remain to show its size or appearance. It was destroyed by fire in 1824, after it had served the village for 85 years. The first teacher was Hansjakob Huser, who served from 1608 to 1645.\n\nThe children from the neighboring village of Neuhausen, those in higher grades, attended school at the Beringen school house. At the time, Neuhausen was merely a small village of fishers and teamsters, and had no rooms for the higher grades.\n\nBy May 1949 a new school house was built-the third one; and it was dedicated to Zimmerberg, but 40 years later, it was already too small and a larger structure was in the planning stages. Because of the sharp increase in the student population, many were schooled in the old school house.\n\n* '''The Old Flour Mill (c. 1536)'''\nThe mill building is several hundred years old. It lies at the upper end of the village. Historically, it was first described in 1536; it belonged to the community as a whole and was leased back to some of the burghers every few years. Repairs and renovations took place in 1843 for the house, 1842 for the mill, and 1841 for the barn. The mill ceased operation decades ago, but the building is still used as a dwelling. Above the main door is the following engraved verse:\n\n        I mill my flour for everyone,\n        Good bread awaits him who can bake.\n        But, there is no miller in all the world \n        who can mill to satisfy everyone.\n\n* '''Der \"Gipsmuehle\" - The Gypsum Mill'''\nThis mill was owned for many generations by the Boll family. The water wheel was six meters (18 feet) high. The gypsum came from the nearby town of Schleitheim and was hauled first by a wagon with six horses, and then later by streetcars. When the material was unloaded in front of the mill, it was first burned in kilns seven feet high; the heavy smoke rose from many holes because it was impossible to build a chimney. The next process was to break the burned gypsum up into small pieces, and then to transfer it into the mill.\n\nAs long as the water was plentiful, the mill ran 24 hours a day. in 1900, 50 kilo of gypsum cost 70 cents; the price went up to four times as much by 1949. By this time, the mill suffered from old age; repairs and remodeling would have cost to much, and so its operation ceased. Today, it has been replaced by several apartment buildings.\n\n* '''The \"Old\" Post House'''\nFive or more generations ago, this building housed a bakery and restaurant as well as a post office. Every midnight, the postal coach would enter the village, coming from the distant town of Freiburg in Breisgau. Long before the coachman approached the Old Post House, he would sound his horn to alert the postmaster to bring his bag of mail out on the street, because the postal coach did not stop.\n\nThe first collection of mail took place in 1846, by a private contractor. Four years later, the mail service was federalized, and in 1862 Beringen received an official post office. In 1874, a telegraph unit was installed, and in 1946 the postal facilities were transferred to a larger building. In 1976, spacious offices were acquired in the community center, \"Zelg\".\n\n[[File:Wirtschaft zum Gemeindehaus in Beringen SH.jpg|thumb|Wirtschaft zum Gemeindehaus]]\n* '''Gemeindehaus Restaurant (Community House )'''\nIn December 1862 Johannes Schneider submitted to the meeting of the citizens a plan to build a public hall that would serve 300 people on tables. The hall was to be heated and complemented with additional rooms. As compensation, he expected not to have to pay any annual license fees for twenty years.\n\nThe answer of the village council was as follows: \n1. Permission would be granted, but a guard's room had to be added, and the premises needed to be used by the village council to house soldiers.\n\n2. Construction would have to be supervised by the village council.\n\n3. The council would pay for an annual fee of fifty francs (about $12.00) for lighting and heating.\n\n4. The owner would be exempt from paying the annual fees for the first twenty years.\n\n5. The building had to be built during the year 1863.\n\nIn near recent years some of the rooms have been remodeled into additional dinning facilities, a bakery shop, coffee shop, and a small garden with a garden restaurant.\n\n* '''The Eagle-House'''\nThis stately building was built in 1863, and was noted for its large roof. Along with several similar structures along the same route, the \"Schaffer-hauser Street\" was/is typical of the buildings built during the time when the first railroads were constructed. Among them was the Baumgarten-House, which was an exact duplication of the Eagle-House.\n\nAfter serving for more than 100 years, the Eagle-House was torn down in 1966, to make room for a super market. This was a rather unattractive building, and was nicknamed the \"shoebox\" by the local people. It was demolished after only 23 years, and the site is now occupied by a shopping center.\n\n* '''The Dalcher-Hueseli'''\nThe Dalcher-Huesli is an reminiscent of rural architecture in Beringen. \"Huesli\" is an endearing name for a small house, which normally had a barn with livestock stalls on the ground floor, and an apartment on the second floor for the servants. Behind the barn would be the living quarters for the owners. Unfortunately, the last Dalcher-Huesli was torn down to make room for a Kiosk and facilities for the public street car system (1964, a new public streetcar company (ASS) starts operation on October 1, replacing the old system of 19050.\n\n==Historical Timeline of Beringen==\n[[File:2006-10-30 10-25-34 Switzerland Zurich Andelfingen.jpg|thumb|Aerial view with surrounding villages and the Rhine.

In linguistic research the name \u201cBollo\u201d designates the family name, while the ending \u201cingen\u201d means children or people. The Bollinger were thus the children, or kin \u201cof the Bollo\u201d. Other surnames were similarly formed, such as Z\u00e4hringer, Merowinger, Zollinger, etc. In those times members of the Bollinger settled in different parts of today's Switzerland, such as Beringen, Canton Schaffhausen and some areas of Canton Aargau, the name often appearing as Bolliger. In the villages of Bolligen, Canton Bern and Bollingen at the upper part of Lake Zurich it led to the naming of these settlements. There now appears to be evidence of the family name dating back to 1362 with notification of the \"Sale of a Bollinger Farm: Buwet 1362\"\n\nThe first document about the Bollingers dates from 1362. The Turbenthal church books only start in 1529. The data for the Chronic of the Bollinger of Neubrunn for the time from 1362 to 1529 was gathered from the archives in of the [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Monastery of St. Gallen]], tax rolls of the town of Zurich, tax books and other sources to show who lived, and when, in Neubrunn.

Conrad Bollinger was from Beringen and his family line dates back to Hans Georg Bollinger (circa 1588, Ancestry.com) of Beringen. Conrad Bollinger was born on August 13, 1846, in Beringen, Schaffhausen, Switzerland, to Katharina Schaad, age 42, and Hans Jakob Bollinger, age 43. He emigrated to the US in 1865. He worked for the War Department in San Antonio, Texas and was living in Texas in 1870. He his family moved to Kings County, New York as he worked at Governors Island, and thereafter they moved to Montvale, New Jersey in 1910. Conrad Bollinger died on December 24, 1920, in Montvale, New Jersey, when he was 74 years old. A large family of Bollingers has evolved from this line, and many are buried at the Westwood Cemetery<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pis&PIcrid=100294&PIpi=1394996&PIMode=cemetery|title=Find A Grave - Millions of Cemetery Records|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> (Also known as: Old Hook Cemetery) Kinderkamack Rd.

''Wings Comics'' was one of Fiction House's \"Big 6\" comics titles (which also included ''[[Jumbo Comics]]'', ''[[Jungle Comics]]'', ''[[Planet Comics]]'', ''[[Fight Comics]]'', and ''[[Rangers Comics]]'').\n\n== Overview ==\nFiction House started out as a [[pulp magazine]] publisher, with one of their more popular titles being ''Wings'' (which ultimately ran 133 issues [11+ volumes], from January 1928 to Spring 1953). ''Wings Comics'', which was produced by the [[Eisner and Iger Studio]], took its title and themes from the pulp title.\n\nThe title initially targeted \"flight enthusiasts, with articles about the history of flight and aerobatics, such as [[wing walking]].\"<ref name=Fury>[http://furycomics.com/viewer/9/Wings_Comics/ \"Wings Comics,\"] Fury Comics. Accessed July 8, 2018.</ref> With the U.S entry into [[World War II]], ''Wings Comics'' began emphasizing \"patriotic war stories,\"<ref name=Fury /> similar to those of [[Captain Midnight]] and [[Quality Comics]]' [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]].<ref name=Fury /> With the end of the war, ''Wings Comics'' returned its focus to historical stories, \"real-life heroes of aviation,\"<ref name=Fury /> and text pieces on [[model aircraft]].\n\nLong-running recurring features in ''Wings Comics'' were \"Jane Martin\" and \"Suicide Smith.\"\n\n== Publication history ==\n''Wings Comics'' started out as a 68-page-monthly, eventually settling on 52 pages per issue until issue #106. The title went to 36 pages for the duration of its run; also becoming quarterly with issue #110 (Winter 1949).\n\nUltimately, Fiction House published 124 issues of ''Wings Comics'' from September 1940\u2013Summer 1954.\n\n== Contributors ==\nDuring the 1940s, [[John Celardo]] was an assistant art director and a major contributor to the Fiction House line, notably for ''Wings Comics.''\n\n[[Art Saaf]] produced covers for issues #7, 15, 19-57, and 98.\n\nPioneering female cartoonist [[Lily Ren\u00e9e]] worked on the \"Jane Martin\" feature in 1943\u20131944. Similarly, [[Ruth Atkinson]]'s first confirmed, signed work is the single-page \"Wing Tips\" featurette in issue #42 (Feb. 1944). Atkinson continued to [[penciler|pencil]] and [[inker|ink]] that featurette, as well as \"Clipper Kirk\" and \"Suicide Smith.\"\n\nLong-time [[Superman]] inker [[Murphy Anderson]]'s first confirmed credit is the two-and-two-thirds-page nonfiction aviation featurette \"Jet Propulsion\" in ''Wings Comics'' #48 ([[cover-date]]d Aug. 1944), and his first fiction feature was an eight-page \"Suicide Smith\" story in issue #50 (Oct. 1944).<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Murphy+Anderson|title=Murphy Anderson}}</ref>\n\n[[Gene Colan]]'s first illustration work was in 1944 for ''Wings Comics'' (\"[J]ust a summertime job before I went into the service\").<ref name=adelaide>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/colan.html |title=Gene Colan |publisher=(interview), Adelaide Comics and Books |year=2003 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKR8XsVQ?url=http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/colan.html |archivedate=March 20, 2011 |url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This led to Colan's the one-page \"Wing Tips\" [[non-fiction]] filler \"[[P-51B Mustang]]\" (issue #52, Dec. 1944).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=4002 ''Wings Comics'' #42, Dec. 1944] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> His first comics story was a seven-page \"Clipper Kirk\" feature in the following month's issue.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=4130 ''Wings Comics'' #53 (Jan. 1945)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nPioneering black cartoonist [[Alvin Hollingsworth]] produced \"Suicide Smith\" at least sporadically from 1946 to 1950.\n\n[[Howard Larsen]], [[George Evans (cartoonist)|George Evans]], [[Tom Gill (artist)|Tom Gill]],<ref name=Gill>[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/tom%20gill/sort/chrono/ Tom Gill] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> [[George Tuska]], and [[Klaus Nordling]] (under the pseudonym \"Clyde North\") were also ''Wing Comics'' contributors.\n\n== Recurring features ==\n'''\"Clipper Kirk\"''' \u2014 ran issues #1\u201370 (1940\u20131946); contributors included [[Art Saaf]], [[Ruth Atkinson]], and [[Gene Colan]]\n\n'''\"Jane Martin\"''' \u2014 espionage feature starring a female pilot working in the male-dominated aviation industry, which ran throughout the title's entire run.

The Battle of Ni\u0161 was part of Hunyadi's expedition known as the ''[[long campaign]]''. Hunyadi, at the head of the vanguard, crossed the [[Balkans]] through the [[Gate of Trajan]], captured [[Ni\u0161]], defeated three Turkish [[pasha]]s, and after taking [[Sofia]], united with the royal army and defeated [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Murad II]] at [[Snaim]] (Kustinitza). The impatience of the king and the severity of the winter then compelled him (in February 1444) to return home, but not before he had utterly broken the Sultan's power in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], Serbia, [[Bulgaria]], and [[Albania (toponym)|Albania]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1440 [[John Hunyadi]] became the trusted adviser and most highly regarded soldier of king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland]]. Hunyadi was rewarded with the captaincy of the fortress of [[Belgrade]] and was put in charge of military operations against the Ottomans. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw recognized Hunyadi's merits by granting him estates in Eastern Hungary. Hunyadi soon showed and displayed an extraordinary capacity to marshal his defences with the limited resources at his disposal. He was victorious in Semendria over [[Isak-Beg]] in 1441. Not far from Nagyszeben in Transylvania he annihilated an Ottoman force and recovered for Hungary the suzerainty of [[Wallachia]]. In July 1442 at the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gates]] he defeated a massed Ottoman formation of 80,000 men led by Sehabbedin. These victories made Hunyadi a prominent enemy of the Ottomans and renowned throughout [[Christendom]], and were prime motivators for him to undertake in 1443, along with King W\u0142adys\u0142aw, the expedition which became known as the ''[[long campaign]]'' with the Battle of Ni\u0161 as one of the battles of this campaign. Hunyadi was accompanied by [[Giuliano Cesarini]] during this campaign.<ref>{{Citation|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPxC6rO7vvsC&pg=PA25 |quote= John Hunyadi accompanied by the cardinal-legate Giuliano Cesarini.|year=1992|page=25|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01078-6}}</ref> The Crusader army consisted of 25,000 or more troops and 600 [[war wagon]]s.{{sfn|Jefferson|2012|pp=207\u2013209}}<ref>{{Citation |last= Setton |first= Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Setton |author2=Harry W.

The Battle of Ni\u0161 was part of Hunyadi's expedition known as the ''[[long campaign]]''. Hunyadi, at the head of the vanguard, crossed the [[Balkans]] through the [[Gate of Trajan]], captured [[Ni\u0161]], defeated three Turkish [[pasha]]s, and after taking [[Sofia]], united with the royal army and defeated [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Murad II]] at [[Snaim]] (Kustinitza). The impatience of the king and the severity of the winter then compelled him (in February 1444) to return home, but not before he had utterly broken the Sultan's power in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], Serbia, [[Bulgaria]], and [[Albania (toponym)|Albania]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1440 [[John Hunyadi]] became the trusted adviser and most highly regarded soldier of king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland]]. Hunyadi was rewarded with the captaincy of the fortress of [[Belgrade]] and was put in charge of military operations against the Ottomans. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw recognized Hunyadi's merits by granting him estates in Eastern Hungary. Hunyadi soon showed and displayed an extraordinary capacity to marshal his defences with the limited resources at his disposal. He was victorious in Semendria over [[Isak-Beg]] in 1441. Not far from Nagyszeben in Transylvania he annihilated an Ottoman force and recovered for Hungary the suzerainty of [[Wallachia]]. In July 1442 at the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gates]] he defeated a massed Ottoman formation of 80,000 men led by Sehabbedin. These victories made Hunyadi a prominent enemy of the Ottomans and renowned throughout [[Christendom]], and were prime motivators for him to undertake in 1443, along with King W\u0142adys\u0142aw, the expedition which became known as the ''[[long campaign]]'' with the Battle of Ni\u0161 as one of the battles of this campaign. Hunyadi was accompanied by [[Giuliano Cesarini]] during this campaign.<ref>{{Citation|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPxC6rO7vvsC&pg=PA25 |quote= John Hunyadi accompanied by the cardinal-legate Giuliano Cesarini.|year=1992|page=25|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01078-6}}</ref> The Crusader army consisted of 25,000 or more troops and 600 [[war wagon]]s.{{sfn|Jefferson|2012|pp=207\u2013209}}<ref>{{Citation |last= Setton |first= Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Setton |author2=Harry W.

In 1974, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] was asked by Sheikh Zayed that the UAE was in dire need of cooperation from Saudi Arabia in its recognition of the country and was asked to open the negotiations over the border issue. King Faisal used the tactic of non-recognition as a leverage against the Emirate of Abu Dhabi to make it reach a settlement quickly. King Faisal was already associated with the issue before 1974 as the minister of foreign affairs during the reign of his father [[King Abdulaziz]]. He has witnessed the failure of many meetings at which British officials sometimes represented Abu Dhabi. He felt the handling of the [[Buraimi Dispute|Buraimi dispute]] in which Saudi troops were defeated and forcibly removed was a great insult to the Kingdom and a blow to be avenged. King Faisal told the UAE delegation which visited him in [[Taif]] in July 1972 that Saudi Arabia had been humiliated in Buraimi and that it would have to retrieve its rights, vowing that it would not abandon property inherited from fathers and grandfathers. Sheikh Zayed was more eager for a settlement but Saudi Arabia's demand was unrealistic as it claimed the annexation of extensive lands in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi some of which contained a number of oil fields.<ref name=T>{{cite book|last=Taryam|first=Abdulla Omran|date=2019|title=The Establishment of the United Arab Emirates 1950-85|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=9781138225787|page=194-195}}</ref><ref name>{{cite book|last=Taryam|first=Abdulla Omran|date=2019|title=The Establishment of the United Arab Emirates 1950-85|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=9781138225787|page=220}}</ref>  \n\nOn 21 August 1974 an agreement was settled between Sheikh Zayed and King Faisal on the demarcation of the frontiers between Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia responded that the treaty has been closed in 1974, except for Article 5 which talks about delineating maritime boundaries.

In 1974, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] was asked by Sheikh Zayed that the UAE was in dire need of cooperation from Saudi Arabia in its recognition of the country and was asked to open the negotiations over the border issue. King Faisal used the tactic of non-recognition as a leverage against the Emirate of Abu Dhabi to make it reach a settlement quickly. King Faisal was already associated with the issue before 1974 as the minister of foreign affairs during the reign of his father [[King Abdulaziz]]. He has witnessed the failure of many meetings at which British officials sometimes represented Abu Dhabi. He felt the handling of the [[Buraimi Dispute|Buraimi dispute]] in which Saudi troops were defeated and forcibly removed was a great insult to the Kingdom and a blow to be avenged. King Faisal told the UAE delegation which visited him in [[Taif]] in July 1972 that Saudi Arabia had been humiliated in Buraimi and that it would have to retrieve its rights, vowing that it would not abandon property inherited from fathers and grandfathers.

{"title_page": "History of anthropometry", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Anthropometric history}}\n\nThe ''history of anthropometry'' includes the use of  as an early tool of anthropology, use for identification, use for the purposes of understanding human physical variation in paleoanthropology and in various attempts to correlate physical with racial and psychological traits. At various points in history, certain anthropometrics have been cited by advocates of discrimination and eugenics often as part of novel or based upon pseudoscience.\n\n==Craniometry and paleoanthropology==\n{{Further|Paleoanthropology|biological anthropology}}\n[[File:Primate skull series with legend cropped.png|right|250px|thumb|Selection of [[Primate]] skulls.]]\nIn 1716 [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]], who wrote many my tiny nipples went to France essays on [[comparative anatomy]] for the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], published his ''Memoir on the Different Positions of the [[Foramina of the skull#List of foramina|Occipital Foramen]] in Man and Animals'' (''M\u00e9moire sur les diff\u00e9rences de la situation du grand trou occipital dans l\u2019homme et dans les animaux''). Six years later [[Pieter Camper]] (1722\u20131789), distinguished both as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures that laid the foundation of much work. Camper invented the \"[[facial angle]],\" a measure meant to determine [[animal intelligence|intelligence]] among various species. According to this technique, a \"facial angle\" was formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the [[nostril]] to the [[ear]]; and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper [[Human jawbone|jawbone]] to the most prominent part of the [[forehead]]. Camper's measurements of facial angle were first made to compare the skulls of men with those of other animals. Camper claimed that antique statues presented an angle of 90\u00b0, Europeans of 80\u00b0, Central Africans of 70\u00b0 and the orangutan of 58\u00b0.\n\nSwedish professor of anatomy [[Anders Retzius]] (1796\u20131860) first used the [[cephalic index]] in [[physical anthropology]] to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. He classed skulls in three main categories; \"dolichocephalic\" (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''kephal\u00ea'', head, and ''dolikhos'', long and thin), \"brachycephalic\" (short and broad) and \"mesocephalic\" (intermediate length and width).  Scientific research was continued by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772\u20131844) and [[Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880), founder of the Anthropological Society in France in 1859. Paleoanthropologists still rely upon craniofacial anthropometry to identify species in the study of fossilized hominid bones. Specimens of ''Homo erectus'' and athletic specimens of ''Homo sapiens'', for example, are virtually identical from the neck down but their skulls can easily be told apart.\n[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''Pithecometra'': In the frontispiece from his 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', [[Thomas Huxley]] compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]\n[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799\u20131851), whose two major monographs were the ''Crania Americana'' (1839), ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca'' (1844) concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not Negroid but Caucasoid and that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since ''The Bible'' indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years before this Noah's sons could not account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of [[polygenism]] the races had been separate from the start.<ref name=\"David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41\">[[David Hurst Thomas]], ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity'', 2001, pp. 38\u201341</ref> [[Josiah C.

Nott and George Gliddon, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854)</ref> Charles Darwin, who thought the [[single-origin hypothesis]] essential to [[evolutionary theory]], opposed Nott and Gliddon in his 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man]]'', arguing for [[monogenism]].\n\nIn 1856, workers found in a limestone quarry the skull of a [[Neanderthal]] hominid male, thinking it to be the remains of a bear. They gave the material to amateur naturalist [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] who turned the fossils over to anatomist [[Hermann Schaaffhausen]]. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857, giving rise to the discipline of [[paleoanthropology]]. By comparing skeletons of apes to man, [[T. H. Huxley]] (1825\u20131895) backed up [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], first expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). He also developed the \"[[Pithecometra principle]],\" which stated that man and ape were descended from a common ancestor.\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]]' (1858\u20131940) discovery in 1891 in Indonesia of the \"[[Java Man]]\", the first specimen of [[Homo erectus]] to be discovered, demonstrated mankind's deep ancestry outside Europe. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834\u20131919) became famous for his \"[[recapitulation theory]]\", according to which each individual mirrors the evolution of the whole species during his life.\n\n==Typology and personality==\n{{Further|Phrenology|physiognomy}}\n[[File:Head-Measurer of Tremearne (side view).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A head-measuring tool designed for anthropological research in the early 1910s.

[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799\u20131851) collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world and started trying to find a way to classify them according to some logical criterion. Morton claimed that he could judge intellectual capacity by [[cranial capacity]]. A large skull meant a large [[Human brain|brain]] and high intellectual capacity, a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. Modern science has since confirmed that there is a correlation between cranium size (measured in various ways) and intelligence as measured by IQ tests, although it is a weak correlation at about 0.2. Today, brain volume as measured with MRI scanners also find a correlation between brain size and intelligence at about 0.4.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rushton|first=J. Philippe|author2=Ankney, C.

At the turn of the 19th century, [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758\u20131822) developed \"cranioscopy\" (Ancient Greek ''kranion'' - \"skull\", ''scopos'' - \"vision\"), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy was later renamed phrenology (''phrenos'': mind, ''logos'': study) by his student [[Johann Spurzheim]] (1776\u20131832), who wrote extensively on \"Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's [[physiognomy|physiognomical]] System.\" These all claimed the ability to predict traits or intelligence and were intensively practised in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the 1940s anthropometry was used by [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] when evaluating his [[somatotype and constitutional psychology|somatotype]]s, according to which characteristics of the body can be translated into characteristics of the mind. Inspired by [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s [[criminal anthropology]], he also believed that [[criminality]] could be predicted according to the body type.  A basically anthropometric division of [[constitution type|body type]]s into the categories [[endomorphism|endomorphic]], [[ectomorphic]] and [[mesomorphic]] derived from Sheldon's [[somatotype and constitutional psychology|somatotype]] theories is today popular among people doing [[weight training]].\n\n==Forensic anthropometry==\n\n===Bertillon, Galton and criminology===\n[[File:The speaking portrait.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration from \"The Speaking Portrait\" (Pearson's Magazine, Vol XI, January to June 1901) demonstrating the principles of Bertillon's anthropometry.]]\nIn 1883, Frenchman [[Alphonse Bertillon]] introduced a system of [[Body identification|identification]] that was named after him.  The \"Bertillonage\" system was based on the finding that several measures of physical features, such as the dimensions of bony structures in the body, that remain fairly constant throughout adult life. Bertillon concluded that when these measurements were made and recorded systematically, every individual would be distinguishable.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anthropometry|volume=2|pages=119\u2013120}} This cites as authorities:\n* [[Cesare Lombroso|Lombroso]], ''Antropometria di 400 delinquenti'' (1872)\n* Roberts, ''Manual of Anthropometry'' (1878)\n* [[Enrico Ferri (criminologist)|Ferri]], ''Studi comparati di antropometria'' (2 vols., 1881\u20131882)\n* Lombroso, ''Rughe anomale speciali ai criminali'' (1890)\n* Bertillon, ''Instructions signal\u00e9tiques pour l'identification anthropom\u00e9trique'' (1893)\n* Livi, ''Anthropometria'' (Milan, 1900)\n* F\u00fcrst, ''Indextabellen zum anthropometrischen Gebrauch'' (Jena, 1902)\n* ''Report of Home Office Committee on the Best Means of Identifying Habitual Criminals'' (1893\u20131894)</ref> Bertillon's goal was a way of identifying [[recidivism|recidivists]] (\"repeat offenders\"). Previously police could only record general descriptions. Photography of criminals had become commonplace, but there was no easy way to sort the many thousands of photographs except by name. Bertillon's hope was that, through the use of measurements, a set of identifying numbers could be entered into a filing system installed in a single cabinet.\n[[File:Galton at Bertillon's (1893).jpg|left|thumb|180px|A Bertillon record for [[Francis Galton]], from a visit to Bertillon's laboratory in 1893.]]\nThe system involved 10 measurements; ''height'', ''stretch'' (distance from left [[shoulder]] to [[middle finger]] of raised right  arm), ''bust'' ([[torso]] from head to seat when seated), ''head length'' (crown to forehead) and ''head width'' temple to temple) ''width'' of [[cheeks]], and \"lengths\" of the ''right [[ear]]'', the ''left [[foot]], [[middle finger]]'', and ''[[cubit]]'' (elbow to tip of middle finger). It was possible, by exhaustion, to sort the cards on which these details were recorded (together with a photograph) until a small number produced the measurements of the individual sought, independently of name.\n[[File:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|thumb|right|250px|A chart from Bertillon's ''Identification anthropom\u00e9trique'' (1893), demonstrating how to take measurements for his identification system.]]\nThe system was soon adapted to police methods: it prevented impersonation and could demonstrate wrongdoing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBertillonage was before long represented in Paris by a collection of some 100,000 cards and became popular in several other countries' justice systems. England followed suit when in 1894, a committee sent to Paris to investigate the methods and its results reported favorably on the use of measurements for primary classification and recommended also the partial adoption of the system of [[finger print]]s suggested by [[Francis Galton]], then in use in [[Bengal]], where measurements were abandoned in 1897 after the fingerprint system was adopted throughout British India. Three years later England followed suit, and, as the result of a fresh inquiry ordered by the Home Office, relied upon fingerprints alone.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nBertillonage exhibited certain defects and was gradually supplanted by the system of [[fingerprint]]s and, latterly, [[genetics]]. Bertillon originally measured variables he thought were independent - such as forearm length and leg length - but Galton had realized that both were the result of a single causal variable (in this case, stature) and  developed the statistical concept of [[correlation]].\n\nOther complications were: it was difficult to tell whether or not individuals arrested were first-time offenders; instruments employed were costly and liable to break down; skilled measurers were needed; errors were frequent and all but irremediable; and it was necessary to repeat measurements three times to arrive at a mean result.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Physiognomy===\n{{Main|Physiognomy}}\nPhysiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835\u20131909), the founder of [[anthropological criminology]], who claimed to be able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a \"[[born criminal]]\" and arguing in favor of [[biological determinism]], Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large [[jaw]]s, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high [[cheekbone]]s, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped [[ear]]s; hawk-like [[Human nose|nose]]s or fleshy [[lip]]s; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.\n\n==Phylogeography, race and human origins==\n[[File:HM-Hsr.jpg|thumb|<center>Display at the [[Horniman Museum]]</center>\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|{{legend|#FFA319|[[Mongoloid]]s|}}||{{legend|#730000|[[Negroids]]|}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#5CB8E6|[[Caucasian race|Caucasoids]]|}}||{{legend|#723900|[[Australoid race|Australoids]]|}}\n|}]]\n{{Main|Phylogeography}}\n[[File:Anthropometry exhibit.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Anthropometry demonstrated in an exhibit from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference.]]\nPhylogeography is the science of identifying and tracking major [[human migrations]], especially in prehistoric times. Linguistics can follow the movement of languages and archaeology can follow the movement of artefact styles but neither can tell whether a culture's spread was due to a source population's physically migrating or to a destination population's simply copying the technology and learning the language. Anthropometry was used extensively by anthropologists studying human and racial origins: some attempted racial differentiation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|classification]], often seeking ways in which certain races were inferior to others.<ref>\"From Savage to Negro\" (1998) Lee D. Baker p.14</ref><ref>\"The Mismeasure of Man\" Stephen Jay Gould (1981)</ref> Nott translated [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853\u20131855), a founding work of racial segregationism that made three main divisions between races, based not on colour but on climatic conditions and geographic location, and privileged the \"Aryan\" race.   Science has tested many theories aligning race and personality, which have been current since [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] (1658\u20131722)  contrasted the ''[[French people|Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (French people), alleged descendants of the Nordic [[Franks]], and members of the [[aristocracy]], to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], considered to be indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] people subordinated by [[right of conquest]].\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Bernier]], [[Carl Linnaeus]] and Blumenbach had examined multiple observable human characteristics in search of a typology. Bernier based his racial classification on physical type which included hair shape, nose shape and skin color. Linnaeus based a similar racial classification scheme. As anthropologists gained access to methods of skull measure they developed racial classification based on skull shape.\n\nTheories of [[scientific racism]] became popular, one prominent figure being [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854\u20131936), who in ''L'Aryen et son r\u00f4le social'' (1899 - \"The [[Aryan]] and his social role\") divided [[human race|humanity]] into various, hierarchized, different \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]\", spanning from the \"[[Aryan]] white race, dolichocephalic\" to the \"brachycephalic\" (short and broad-headed) race. Between these Vacher de Lapouge identified the \"''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the \"''[[Homo alpinus]]''\" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.) and the \"''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''\" ([[Naples|Napolitano]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.). \"Homo africanus\" (Congo, Florida) was excluded from discussion. His racial classification (\"Teutonic\", \"Alpine\" and \"Mediterranean\") was also used by [[William Z. Ripley]] (1867\u20131941) who, in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), made a map of [[Europe]] according to the cephalic index of its inhabitants.\n\nVacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of [[Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] and [[Nazi policies|Nazi ideology]].<ref>See [[Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang - Doctrines racistes \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'' (\"Colour and Blood - doctrines ''\u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise''\"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 - Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La D\u00e9couverte, 1987, 644 pages</ref> [[Nazi Germany]] relied on anthropometric measurements to distinguish [[Aryan]]s from [[Jew]]s and many forms of anthropometry were used for the advocacy of [[eugenics]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, though, members of the school of [[cultural anthropology]] of [[Franz Boas]] began to use anthropometric approaches to discredit the concept of fixed biological race.  Boas used the cephalic index to show the influence of environmental factors. Researches on skulls and skeletons eventually helped liberate 19th century European science from its [[ethnocentric]] bias.<ref name=HuxAI>\"Cultural Biases Reflected in the Hominid Fossil Record\" (history), by Joshua Barbach and Craig Byron, 2005, ''ArchaeologyInfo.com'' webpage: [http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/perspectives003.htm ArchaeologyInfo-003].</ref> This school of physical anthropology generally went into decline during the 1940s.\n\n===Race and brain size===\nSeveral studies have demonstrated correlations between race and brain size, with varying results. In some studies, Caucasians were reported to have larger brains than other racial groups, whereas in recent studies and reanalysis of previous studies, East Asians were reported as having larger brains and skulls. More common among the studies was the report that Africans had smaller skulls than either Caucasians or East Asians. Criticisms have been raised against a number of these studies regarding questionable methods.\n\n[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|200px|An 1839 drawing by [[Samuel George Morton]] of \"a Negro head\u2026 a Caucasian skull\u2026 a Mongol head.\"]]\nIn ''Crania Americana'' Morton claimed that Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.<ref name=\"David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41\"/> In 1873 [[Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880) found the same pattern described by Samuel Morton's ''Crania Americana'' by weighing brains at [[autopsy]]. Other historical studies alleging a Black-White difference in brain size include Bean (1906), Mall, (1909), Pearl, (1934) and Vint (1934). But in Germany [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s study led him to denounce \"[[Nordic theory|Nordic mysticism]]\" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]]. [[Josef Kollmann]], a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a \"mixture of various races,\" furthermore declaring that the \"results of craniology\" led to \"struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race\".<ref name=Orsucci>Andrea Orsucci, \"[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121218231754/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2012-12-18 }}, ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{in lang|it}}</ref> Virchow later rejected measure of skulls as legitimate means of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

Kleiweg de Zwaan circa1910.jpg|thumb|Plaster face casts of [[Nias]] islanders collected by J.P. Kleiweg de Zwaan, circa 1910]]\nObservable craniofacial differences included: head shape (mesocephalic, brachycephalic, dolichocephalic) breadth of nasal aperture, nasal root height, sagittal crest appearance, jaw thickness, brow ridge size and forehead slope. Using this skull-based categorization, German philosopher Christoph Meiners in his The Outline of History of Mankind (1785) identified three racial groups:\n\n*[[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] characterized by a tall dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas, large brow ridge and projecting-narrow nasal apertures.\n*[[Negroid]] characterized by a short dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas and wide nasal apertures.\n*[[Mongoloid]] characterized by a medium brachycephalic skull, projecting zygomas, small brow ridge and small nasal apertures.\n\nRipley's ''The Races of Europe'' was rewritten in 1939 by Harvard physical anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]]. [[Carleton S. Coon]], a 20th-century craniofacial anthropometrist, used the technique for his ''The Origin of Races'' (New York: Knopf, 1962). Because of the inconsistencies in the old three-part system (Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid), Coon adopted a five-part scheme. He defined \"Caucasoid\" as a pattern of skull measurements and other phenotypical characteristics typical of populations in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], and Northeast Africa ([[Ethiopia]], and [[Somalia]]). He discarded the term \"Negroid\" as misleading since it implies skin-tone, which is found at low latitudes around the globe and is a product of adaptation, and defined skulls typical of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] as \"Congoid\" and those of [[Southern Africa]] as \"Capoid\". Finally, he split \"Australoid\" from \"Mongoloid\" along a line roughly similar to the modern distinction between sinodonts in the north and sundadonts in the south. He argued that these races had developed independently of each other over the past half-million years, developing into Homo Sapiens at different periods of time, resulting in different levels of civilization. This raised considerable controversy and led the [[American Anthropological Association]] to reject his approach without mentioning him by name.<ref>Marks, Jonathan ''What it means to be 98% Chimpanzee'' University of California Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-520-24064-3}} pp. 76-77 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HUBe0wjowLMC&pg=PA76&dq=coon+%22origin+of+races%22&ei=GqDKSLzvDZX4iQGF4KX3Cw&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U1EeYDoitthqhZ9pvsJmzVAqFLQMA#PPA76,M1]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) Coon classified Caucasoids into racial sub-groups named after regions or archaeological sites such as Br\u00fcnn, Borreby, Alpine, Ladogan, East Baltic, Neo-Danubian, Lappish, Mediterranean, Atlanto-Mediterranean, Irano-Afghan, Nordic, Hallstatt, Keltic, Tronder, Dinaric, Noric and Armenoid. This typological view of race, however, was starting to be seen as out-of-date at the time of publication.

Six years later [[Pieter Camper]] (1722\u20131789), distinguished both as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures that laid the foundation of much work. Camper invented the \"[[facial angle]],\" a measure meant to determine [[animal intelligence|intelligence]] among various species. According to this technique, a \"facial angle\" was formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the [[nostril]] to the [[ear]]; and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper [[Human jawbone|jawbone]] to the most prominent part of the [[forehead]]. Camper's measurements of facial angle were first made to compare the skulls of men with those of other animals. Camper claimed that antique statues presented an angle of 90\u00b0, Europeans of 80\u00b0, Central Africans of 70\u00b0 and the orangutan of 58\u00b0.\n\nSwedish professor of anatomy [[Anders Retzius]] (1796\u20131860) first used the [[cephalic index]] in [[physical anthropology]] to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. He classed skulls in three main categories; \"dolichocephalic\" (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''kephal\u00ea'', head, and ''dolikhos'', long and thin), \"brachycephalic\" (short and broad) and \"mesocephalic\" (intermediate length and width).  Scientific research was continued by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772\u20131844) and [[Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880), founder of the Anthropological Society in France in 1859. Paleoanthropologists still rely upon craniofacial anthropometry to identify species in the study of fossilized hominid bones. Specimens of ''Homo erectus'' and athletic specimens of ''Homo sapiens'', for example, are virtually identical from the neck down but their skulls can easily be told apart.\n[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''Pithecometra'': In the frontispiece from his 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', [[Thomas Huxley]] compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]\n[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799\u20131851), whose two major monographs were the ''Crania Americana'' (1839), ''An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America'' and ''Crania Aegyptiaca'' (1844) concluded that the [[ancient Egyptians]] were not Negroid but Caucasoid and that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since ''The Bible'' indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years before this Noah's sons could not account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of [[polygenism]] the races had been separate from the start.<ref name=\"David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41\">[[David Hurst Thomas]], ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity'', 2001, pp. 38\u201341</ref> [[Josiah C.

They gave the material to amateur naturalist [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] who turned the fossils over to anatomist [[Hermann Schaaffhausen]]. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857, giving rise to the discipline of [[paleoanthropology]]. By comparing skeletons of apes to man, [[T. H. Huxley]] (1825\u20131895) backed up [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], first expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859). He also developed the \"[[Pithecometra principle]],\" which stated that man and ape were descended from a common ancestor.\n\n[[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]]' (1858\u20131940) discovery in 1891 in Indonesia of the \"[[Java Man]]\", the first specimen of [[Homo erectus]] to be discovered, demonstrated mankind's deep ancestry outside Europe. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834\u20131919) became famous for his \"[[recapitulation theory]]\", according to which each individual mirrors the evolution of the whole species during his life.\n\n==Typology and personality==\n{{Further|Phrenology|physiognomy}}\n[[File:Head-Measurer of Tremearne (side view).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A head-measuring tool designed for anthropological research in the early 1910s.

[[Samuel George Morton]] (1799\u20131851) collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world and started trying to find a way to classify them according to some logical criterion. Morton claimed that he could judge intellectual capacity by [[cranial capacity]]. A large skull meant a large [[Human brain|brain]] and high intellectual capacity, a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. Modern science has since confirmed that there is a correlation between cranium size (measured in various ways) and intelligence as measured by IQ tests, although it is a weak correlation at about 0.2. Today, brain volume as measured with MRI scanners also find a correlation between brain size and intelligence at about 0.4.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rushton|first=J. Philippe|author2=Ankney, C.

At the turn of the 19th century, [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758\u20131822) developed \"cranioscopy\" (Ancient Greek ''kranion'' - \"skull\", ''scopos'' - \"vision\"), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy was later renamed phrenology (''phrenos'': mind, ''logos'': study) by his student [[Johann Spurzheim]] (1776\u20131832), who wrote extensively on \"Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's [[physiognomy|physiognomical]] System.\" These all claimed the ability to predict traits or intelligence and were intensively practised in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the 1940s anthropometry was used by [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] when evaluating his [[somatotype and constitutional psychology|somatotype]]s, according to which characteristics of the body can be translated into characteristics of the mind. Inspired by [[Cesare Lombroso]]'s [[criminal anthropology]], he also believed that [[criminality]] could be predicted according to the body type.  A basically anthropometric division of [[constitution type|body type]]s into the categories [[endomorphism|endomorphic]], [[ectomorphic]] and [[mesomorphic]] derived from Sheldon's [[somatotype and constitutional psychology|somatotype]] theories is today popular among people doing [[weight training]].\n\n==Forensic anthropometry==\n\n===Bertillon, Galton and criminology===\n[[File:The speaking portrait.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration from \"The Speaking Portrait\" (Pearson's Magazine, Vol XI, January to June 1901) demonstrating the principles of Bertillon's anthropometry.]]\nIn 1883, Frenchman [[Alphonse Bertillon]] introduced a system of [[Body identification|identification]] that was named after him.  The \"Bertillonage\" system was based on the finding that several measures of physical features, such as the dimensions of bony structures in the body, that remain fairly constant throughout adult life. Bertillon concluded that when these measurements were made and recorded systematically, every individual would be distinguishable.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anthropometry|volume=2|pages=119\u2013120}} This cites as authorities:\n* [[Cesare Lombroso|Lombroso]], ''Antropometria di 400 delinquenti'' (1872)\n* Roberts, ''Manual of Anthropometry'' (1878)\n* [[Enrico Ferri (criminologist)|Ferri]], ''Studi comparati di antropometria'' (2 vols., 1881\u20131882)\n* Lombroso, ''Rughe anomale speciali ai criminali'' (1890)\n* Bertillon, ''Instructions signal\u00e9tiques pour l'identification anthropom\u00e9trique'' (1893)\n* Livi, ''Anthropometria'' (Milan, 1900)\n* F\u00fcrst, ''Indextabellen zum anthropometrischen Gebrauch'' (Jena, 1902)\n* ''Report of Home Office Committee on the Best Means of Identifying Habitual Criminals'' (1893\u20131894)</ref> Bertillon's goal was a way of identifying [[recidivism|recidivists]] (\"repeat offenders\"). Previously police could only record general descriptions. Photography of criminals had become commonplace, but there was no easy way to sort the many thousands of photographs except by name. Bertillon's hope was that, through the use of measurements, a set of identifying numbers could be entered into a filing system installed in a single cabinet.\n[[File:Galton at Bertillon's (1893).jpg|left|thumb|180px|A Bertillon record for [[Francis Galton]], from a visit to Bertillon's laboratory in 1893.]]\nThe system involved 10 measurements; ''height'', ''stretch'' (distance from left [[shoulder]] to [[middle finger]] of raised right  arm), ''bust'' ([[torso]] from head to seat when seated), ''head length'' (crown to forehead) and ''head width'' temple to temple) ''width'' of [[cheeks]], and \"lengths\" of the ''right [[ear]]'', the ''left [[foot]], [[middle finger]]'', and ''[[cubit]]'' (elbow to tip of middle finger). It was possible, by exhaustion, to sort the cards on which these details were recorded (together with a photograph) until a small number produced the measurements of the individual sought, independently of name.\n[[File:Bertillon - Signalement Anthropometrique.png|thumb|right|250px|A chart from Bertillon's ''Identification anthropom\u00e9trique'' (1893), demonstrating how to take measurements for his identification system.]]\nThe system was soon adapted to police methods: it prevented impersonation and could demonstrate wrongdoing.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBertillonage was before long represented in Paris by a collection of some 100,000 cards and became popular in several other countries' justice systems. England followed suit when in 1894, a committee sent to Paris to investigate the methods and its results reported favorably on the use of measurements for primary classification and recommended also the partial adoption of the system of [[finger print]]s suggested by [[Francis Galton]], then in use in [[Bengal]], where measurements were abandoned in 1897 after the fingerprint system was adopted throughout British India. Three years later England followed suit, and, as the result of a fresh inquiry ordered by the Home Office, relied upon fingerprints alone.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nBertillonage exhibited certain defects and was gradually supplanted by the system of [[fingerprint]]s and, latterly, [[genetics]]. Bertillon originally measured variables he thought were independent - such as forearm length and leg length - but Galton had realized that both were the result of a single causal variable (in this case, stature) and  developed the statistical concept of [[correlation]].\n\nOther complications were: it was difficult to tell whether or not individuals arrested were first-time offenders; instruments employed were costly and liable to break down; skilled measurers were needed; errors were frequent and all but irremediable; and it was necessary to repeat measurements three times to arrive at a mean result.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Physiognomy===\n{{Main|Physiognomy}}\nPhysiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835\u20131909), the founder of [[anthropological criminology]], who claimed to be able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a \"[[born criminal]]\" and arguing in favor of [[biological determinism]], Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large [[jaw]]s, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high [[cheekbone]]s, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped [[ear]]s; hawk-like [[Human nose|nose]]s or fleshy [[lip]]s; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.\n\n==Phylogeography, race and human origins==\n[[File:HM-Hsr.jpg|thumb|<center>Display at the [[Horniman Museum]]</center>\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|{{legend|#FFA319|[[Mongoloid]]s|}}||{{legend|#730000|[[Negroids]]|}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#5CB8E6|[[Caucasian race|Caucasoids]]|}}||{{legend|#723900|[[Australoid race|Australoids]]|}}\n|}]]\n{{Main|Phylogeography}}\n[[File:Anthropometry exhibit.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Anthropometry demonstrated in an exhibit from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference.]]\nPhylogeography is the science of identifying and tracking major [[human migrations]], especially in prehistoric times. Linguistics can follow the movement of languages and archaeology can follow the movement of artefact styles but neither can tell whether a culture's spread was due to a source population's physically migrating or to a destination population's simply copying the technology and learning the language. Anthropometry was used extensively by anthropologists studying human and racial origins: some attempted racial differentiation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|classification]], often seeking ways in which certain races were inferior to others.<ref>\"From Savage to Negro\" (1998) Lee D. Baker p.14</ref><ref>\"The Mismeasure of Man\" Stephen Jay Gould (1981)</ref> Nott translated [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853\u20131855), a founding work of racial segregationism that made three main divisions between races, based not on colour but on climatic conditions and geographic location, and privileged the \"Aryan\" race.   Science has tested many theories aligning race and personality, which have been current since [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] (1658\u20131722)  contrasted the ''[[French people|Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (French people), alleged descendants of the Nordic [[Franks]], and members of the [[aristocracy]], to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]], considered to be indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] people subordinated by [[right of conquest]].\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Bernier]], [[Carl Linnaeus]] and Blumenbach had examined multiple observable human characteristics in search of a typology. Bernier based his racial classification on physical type which included hair shape, nose shape and skin color. Linnaeus based a similar racial classification scheme. As anthropologists gained access to methods of skull measure they developed racial classification based on skull shape.\n\nTheories of [[scientific racism]] became popular, one prominent figure being [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854\u20131936), who in ''L'Aryen et son r\u00f4le social'' (1899 - \"The [[Aryan]] and his social role\") divided [[human race|humanity]] into various, hierarchized, different \"[[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]\", spanning from the \"[[Aryan]] white race, dolichocephalic\" to the \"brachycephalic\" (short and broad-headed) race. Between these Vacher de Lapouge identified the \"''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the \"''[[Homo alpinus]]''\" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.) and the \"''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''\" ([[Naples|Napolitano]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.). \"Homo africanus\" (Congo, Florida) was excluded from discussion. His racial classification (\"Teutonic\", \"Alpine\" and \"Mediterranean\") was also used by [[William Z. Ripley]] (1867\u20131941) who, in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), made a map of [[Europe]] according to the cephalic index of its inhabitants.\n\nVacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of [[Nazi]] [[anti-semitism]] and [[Nazi policies|Nazi ideology]].<ref>See [[Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang - Doctrines racistes \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'' (\"Colour and Blood - doctrines ''\u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise''\"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 - Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La D\u00e9couverte, 1987, 644 pages</ref> [[Nazi Germany]] relied on anthropometric measurements to distinguish [[Aryan]]s from [[Jew]]s and many forms of anthropometry were used for the advocacy of [[eugenics]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, though, members of the school of [[cultural anthropology]] of [[Franz Boas]] began to use anthropometric approaches to discredit the concept of fixed biological race.  Boas used the cephalic index to show the influence of environmental factors. Researches on skulls and skeletons eventually helped liberate 19th century European science from its [[ethnocentric]] bias.<ref name=HuxAI>\"Cultural Biases Reflected in the Hominid Fossil Record\" (history), by Joshua Barbach and Craig Byron, 2005, ''ArchaeologyInfo.com'' webpage: [http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/perspectives003.htm ArchaeologyInfo-003].</ref> This school of physical anthropology generally went into decline during the 1940s.\n\n===Race and brain size===\nSeveral studies have demonstrated correlations between race and brain size, with varying results. In some studies, Caucasians were reported to have larger brains than other racial groups, whereas in recent studies and reanalysis of previous studies, East Asians were reported as having larger brains and skulls. More common among the studies was the report that Africans had smaller skulls than either Caucasians or East Asians. Criticisms have been raised against a number of these studies regarding questionable methods.\n\n[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|200px|An 1839 drawing by [[Samuel George Morton]] of \"a Negro head\u2026 a Caucasian skull\u2026 a Mongol head.\"]]\nIn ''Crania Americana'' Morton claimed that Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.<ref name=\"David Hurst Thomas 2001, pp. 38 - 41\"/> In 1873 [[Paul Broca]] (1824\u20131880) found the same pattern described by Samuel Morton's ''Crania Americana'' by weighing brains at [[autopsy]]. Other historical studies alleging a Black-White difference in brain size include Bean (1906), Mall, (1909), Pearl, (1934) and Vint (1934). But in Germany [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s study led him to denounce \"[[Nordic theory|Nordic mysticism]]\" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]]. [[Josef Kollmann]], a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a \"mixture of various races,\" furthermore declaring that the \"results of craniology\" led to \"struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race\".<ref name=Orsucci>Andrea Orsucci, \"[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121218231754/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2012-12-18 }}, ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{in lang|it}}</ref> Virchow later rejected measure of skulls as legitimate means of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

Kleiweg de Zwaan circa1910.jpg|thumb|Plaster face casts of [[Nias]] islanders collected by J.P. Kleiweg de Zwaan, circa 1910]]\nObservable craniofacial differences included: head shape (mesocephalic, brachycephalic, dolichocephalic) breadth of nasal aperture, nasal root height, sagittal crest appearance, jaw thickness, brow ridge size and forehead slope. Using this skull-based categorization, German philosopher Christoph Meiners in his The Outline of History of Mankind (1785) identified three racial groups:\n\n*[[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] characterized by a tall dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas, large brow ridge and projecting-narrow nasal apertures.\n*[[Negroid]] characterized by a short dolichocephalic skull, receded zygomas and wide nasal apertures.\n*[[Mongoloid]] characterized by a medium brachycephalic skull, projecting zygomas, small brow ridge and small nasal apertures.\n\nRipley's ''The Races of Europe'' was rewritten in 1939 by Harvard physical anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]]. [[Carleton S. Coon]], a 20th-century craniofacial anthropometrist, used the technique for his ''The Origin of Races'' (New York: Knopf, 1962). Because of the inconsistencies in the old three-part system (Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Negroid), Coon adopted a five-part scheme. He defined \"Caucasoid\" as a pattern of skull measurements and other phenotypical characteristics typical of populations in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], and Northeast Africa ([[Ethiopia]], and [[Somalia]]). He discarded the term \"Negroid\" as misleading since it implies skin-tone, which is found at low latitudes around the globe and is a product of adaptation, and defined skulls typical of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] as \"Congoid\" and those of [[Southern Africa]] as \"Capoid\". Finally, he split \"Australoid\" from \"Mongoloid\" along a line roughly similar to the modern distinction between sinodonts in the north and sundadonts in the south. He argued that these races had developed independently of each other over the past half-million years, developing into Homo Sapiens at different periods of time, resulting in different levels of civilization. This raised considerable controversy and led the [[American Anthropological Association]] to reject his approach without mentioning him by name.<ref>Marks, Jonathan ''What it means to be 98% Chimpanzee'' University of California Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-520-24064-3}} pp. 76-77 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HUBe0wjowLMC&pg=PA76&dq=coon+%22origin+of+races%22&ei=GqDKSLzvDZX4iQGF4KX3Cw&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U1EeYDoitthqhZ9pvsJmzVAqFLQMA#PPA76,M1]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Races of Europe (Coon)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) Coon classified Caucasoids into racial sub-groups named after regions or archaeological sites such as Br\u00fcnn, Borreby, Alpine, Ladogan, East Baltic, Neo-Danubian, Lappish, Mediterranean, Atlanto-Mediterranean, Irano-Afghan, Nordic, Hallstatt, Keltic, Tronder, Dinaric, Noric and Armenoid. This typological view of race, however, was starting to be seen as out-of-date at the time of publication.

stretches from the south coast of Wales up to the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons. The 93 [[Scheduled monument]]s include 43 prehistoric sites which include a stone circle, standing stones, burial mounds and chambered tombs. The 6 Roman sites are all connected to military occupation. There are 18 medieval sites which include abbeys, castles and churches. The  26 post-medieval sites are mostly connected to over 400 years of industrial activity in the area. All of the sites on this list (and the whole of Neath Port Talbot County Borough) are within the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]]. 5 of the sites lie on or cross the border into neighbouring counties, and are included on both lists.\n\nScheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) have statutory protection. It is illegal to disturb the ground surface or any standing remains.

stretches from the south coast of Wales up to the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons. The 93 [[Scheduled monument]]s include 43 prehistoric sites which include a stone circle, standing stones, burial mounds and chambered tombs. The 6 Roman sites are all connected to military occupation. There are 18 medieval sites which include abbeys, castles and churches. The  26 post-medieval sites are mostly connected to over 400 years of industrial activity in the area. All of the sites on this list (and the whole of Neath Port Talbot County Borough) are within the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]]. 5 of the sites lie on or cross the border into neighbouring counties, and are included on both lists.\n\nScheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) have statutory protection. It is illegal to disturb the ground surface or any standing remains. The compilation of the list is undertaken by Cadw Welsh Historic Monuments, which is an executive agency of the National Assembly of Wales.<ref>[http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/historicenvironment/protection/monuments/?lang=en Cadw: Ancient Monuments and Scheduling.] Accessed 25 April 2013</ref> The list of scheduled monuments below is supplied by Cadw<ref>Cadw will send their list as a spreadsheet, or other electronic formats, on request, as indicated at [https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/listed_buildings_and_scheduled_a#incoming-319360 www.whatdotheyknow.com].

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]].

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]]. Later paroled [[POWs]] would also join the resistance.\n\n==Macabebe Scouts==\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Macabebe Scouts\n|image=\n|caption=\n|dates=1899\u20131901\n|country={{flag|United States|1896}}<br>{{small|(1898\u20131901)}}\n|allegiance={{flag|United States of America|1896}}\n* {{flagdeco|United States|1896}} [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Military Government]]<br>{{small|(1899\u20131901)}}\n|branch={{army|United States}} (1899\u20131901)\n|type= [[Militia]], [[Irregular military|Irregulars]]\n|role= [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[reconnaissance]]\n|size= 1402 in December 1900<ref name=dum>{{cite web |last=Dumindin |first=Arnaldo |title=Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |url=http://www.filipinoamericanwar.com/thewarrages1899.htm |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|command_structure=\n|garrison=\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=\n|colors=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|equipment=\n|equipment_label=\n|battles=[[Philippine\u2013American War]]<br>[[Moro rebellion]]\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|disbanded=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1=\n|commander1_label=\n|commander2=\n|commander2_label=\n|commander3=\n|commander3_label=\n|notable_commanders=General [[Henry Lawton]]<br>\nGeneral [[Frederick Funston]]<br>\nLieutenant [[Matthew A.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.
