Bastedo received notice on the European continent, earning her the nickname, \"La Bastedo\". Although most familiar to viewers of 1960s TV, she was also known for her multilingual skills, speaking Italian, Spanish, French and German.

'''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled.

During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.

Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there.  St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\"{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}  Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar. \n\nGeneral Harmar's forces of about 1,453 militia and regulars departed [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on 7 October 1790.

'''Northwest Indian War''' (1785\u20131795), also known as the '''Ohio War''', '''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled.

During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.

Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there.  St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\"{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}  Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar. \n\nGeneral Harmar's forces of about 1,453 militia and regulars departed [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on 7 October 1790.

Completed in 1923, it will be the first stadium to have hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] three times: [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].<ref name=\"USC News 2018-03-29\"/> It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"NPS-LANDMARK\" />\n\nThe stadium serves as the home to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) [[USC Trojans football|Trojans football team]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. USC, which operates and manages the Coliseum, granted naming rights to [[United Airlines]] in January 2018; after concerns were raised by Coliseum Commission, the airline became title sponsor of the playing field, naming it '''United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum'''. The stadium is located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], which is owned by the State of California, and across the street from USC.

The Coliseum served as their home stadium again from 2016 to 2019 prior to the team's move to [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]].

It was the site of the [[Super Bowl I|First AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later called Super Bowl I, and [[Super Bowl VII]]. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the [[1960 Los Angeles Chargers season|1960]] inaugural season for the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] of the NFL, and [[UCLA Bruins football]].\n\nFrom 1959 to 2016, the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was closed in March 2016 and demolished.

When the Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles with a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows seats with two tiers of tunnels, expanding the seating capacity to 101,574. The now-signature Olympic torch was added. For a time it was known as '''Olympic Stadium'''. The [[Olympic cauldron]] torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings symbols over one of the main entrances. The football field runs east to west with the press box on the south side of the stadium. The current jumbotrons to each side of the peristyle were installed in 2017 and replaced a scoreboard and video screen that towered over the peristyle dating back to 1983; they replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed along the north and south rims.  The large analog clock and thermometer over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 1955. In the mid- and late 1950s the press box was renovated and the \"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\" lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower.  Between the double peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum's \"Court of Honor\"\u2014plaques recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in Coliseum history, including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists. (The complete roster of honorees can be seen below.)\n\n===Renovations===\nFor many years the Coliseum was capable of seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964 the stadium underwent its first major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs of dark red, beige, and yellow; these seats remained until 2018, though the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The [[seating capacity]] was reduced to approximately 93,000.\n\nThe Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the NFL. While this allowed the Rams and Raiders to set many NFL attendance records, it also made it extremely difficult to sell out. The NFL amended its [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout rule]] to allow games to be televised locally if they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff. However, due to the Coliseum's large size, Rams (and later Raiders) games were often blacked out in [[Southern California]] even in the teams' best years.\n\nPartly due to this, from 1964 to the late 1970s it was common practice to shift the playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available for sale. For [[University of Southern California|USC]]&ndash;[[UCLA]] and USC-[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] games, which often attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand was installed in 1977\u20131978 at the behest of Rams owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside it.  However, the combination of the stadium's large, relatively shallow design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million renovation before the 1993 football season which included the following:<ref name=USCColiseum />\n\n* The field was lowered by {{convert|11|ft|m|1}} and 14 new rows of seats replaced the running track, bringing the first row of seats closer to the playing field (a maximum distance of {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} at the eastern 30-yard-line).\n* A portable seating section was built between the eastern endline and the peristyle bleachers (the stands are removed for concerts and similar events).\n* The locker rooms and public restrooms were modernized.\n* The bleachers were replaced with individual seating.<ref>[http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm Stadiums of the NFL-Los Angeles Coliseum-Los Angeles Rams/Raiders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205140916/http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm |date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, for Raiders home games, [[tarpaulin]]s were placed over seldom-sold sections, reducing [[seating capacity]] to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by [[HNTB]] that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). However, after the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], the $93 million was required from government agencies (including the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] before  electing to move back to the [[Oakland Coliseum]] prior to the 1995 NFL season. The last element of the Northridge earthquake repairs was the replacement of the condemned press box with a new press box in 1995.\n\n====New videoboard====\nIn August 2011, construction began on the Coliseum's west end on a new {{convert|6000|sqfoot|adj=on}} [[High-definition video|HD video]] scoreboard, accompanying the existing video scoreboard on the peristyle (east end) of the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2011/04/coliseum-video-board.html|title=USC Official Athletic Site \u2013 USCTrojans.com|website=www.usctrojans.com}}</ref> The video scoreboard officially went into operation on September 3, 2011, at USC football's home opener versus the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]], with the game being televised on [[ABC College Football|ABC]].\n\n====2018\u20132019 renovation project====\nAfter USC took over the Coliseum master lease in 2013, they began making plans for major renovations needed and as stipulated in the master lease agreement.

The Dodgers played here until [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for the 1962 season.  Even allowing for its temporary status, the Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of football and baseball fields. A baseball field requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron, but the playing surface was just barely large enough to accommodate a baseball diamond. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive down the third base line with a very large [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]] for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as {{convert|710|ft|m|0}} from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker rooms were huge, because they were designed for [[American football|football]] (not baseball) teams.\n\nIn order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only {{convert|251|ft|m}} from the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many \"[[Chinese home run]]s\", as such short shots were called at the time, and sportswriters began jokingly referring to the improvised park as \"O'Malley's Chinese Theatre\"<ref name=\"Mover and Shaker\">{{cite book|last1=McCue|first1=Andy|title=Mover and Shaker: Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers, and Baseball's Westward Expansion|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803255050|pages=221\u201322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> or \"The House that [[Charlie Chan]] Built\", drawing protests from the [[Chinese American]] community in the Los Angeles area.<ref name=\"Close Shave\">{{cite book|last1=Szalontai|first1=James D.|title=Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie|date=2002|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786411894|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&pg=PA356|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially [[Babe Ruth]]'s 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of {{convert|250|foot|adj=on}} pop flies going over the left-field fence.

In the first week of play during [[1959 Major League Baseball season|the 1959 season]], the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by [[Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Lee Walls]], not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder [[Wally Moon]], who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed \"[[Moonshot (baseball)|Moon Shots]].\"<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nNonetheless, the number of home runs alarmed Frick enough that he ordered the Dodgers to build a second screen in the stands, {{convert|333|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the plate.

However, the Dodgers discovered that the earthquake safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code forbade construction of a second screen.<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nUnable to compel the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 1.04 stating that any stadium constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} down each foul line. Also, when the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels]] joined the [[American League]] for 1961, Frick rejected their original request to use the Coliseum as a temporary facility.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}</ref>  This rule was revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched the \"Retro Ballpark\" era in 1993, with the opening of Camden Yards.

However, baseball fans heartily welcomed the \"new/old\" style, and all new ballparks since then have been allowed to set their own distances.\n\n[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|240px|The Coliseum during the [[1959 World Series]]]]\nLate that season, the screen figured in the National League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] race.

The Dodgers won the ensuing playoff and went on to win the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].\n\nAlthough less than ideal for baseball due to its poor sight lines and short dimensions (left field at {{convert|251|ft}} [mentioned above] and power alleys at {{convert|320|ft|m}}) it was ideally suited for large paying crowds. Each of the three games of the 1959 World Series played there drew over 92,000 fans, with game 5 drawing 92,706, a [[Major League Baseball attendance records|record]] unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon, given the smaller seating capacities of today's baseball parks. A May 1959 exhibition game between the Dodgers and the [[New York Yankees]] in honor of legendary catcher [[Roy Campanella]] drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the Western Hemisphere until an exhibition game in 2008 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[Boston Red Sox]] to mark the 50th anniversary of MLB in Los Angeles. The Coliseum also hosted the second [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|1959]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]].\n\nThe Coliseum was also the site of John F.

The Coliseum was the site of the very first [[Super Bowl I|NFL-AFL Championship Game]] in January 1967, an event since renamed the [[Super Bowl]]. It also hosted the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl in 1973]], but future Super Bowls in the Los Angeles region would instead be hosted at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], which has never had an NFL tenant. The venue was also the site of the NFL [[Pro Bowl]] from [[1951 NFL season|1951]] to [[1972 NFL season|1972]] and again in [[1979 NFL season|1979]].\n\nIn [[List of American Football League seasons#1960 .5B1.5D|1960]], the [[American Football League]]'s [[Los Angeles Chargers]] played at the Coliseum before relocating to San Diego the next year; the team moved back to its original home in [[2017 NFL season|2017]].\n\nThe [[United States men's national soccer team]] played its first match as the stadium in 1965, losing to Mexico in a 1966 World Cup qualifier.

Over 100,000 Black residents of Los Angeles attended this concert for African American pride. Later, in 1973, a documentary was released about the concert.\n\nIn 1973, [[Evel Knievel]] used the entire distance of the stadium to jump 50 stacked cars at the stadium. Knievel launched his motorcycle from atop one end of the Coliseum, jumping the cars in the center of the field, and stopping high atop the other end. The jump was filmed by ABC Wide World of Sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/wwos/e_knievel.html|title=ABC Sports \u2013 Wide World of Sports|website=espn.go.com}}</ref> Also in 1973, the Coliseum was host to Super Bowl VII which saw the AFC champion [[Miami Dolphins]] (17\u20130) defeat the NFC champion [[Washington Redskins]] (13\u20134), 14\u20137, and become the only team in NFL history to attain an undefeated season and postseason.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams played their home games in the Coliseum until 1979, when they moved to [[Anaheim]] prior to the [[1980 NFL Season]]. They hosted the NFC Championship Game in 1975 & 1978 in which they lost both times to the Dallas Cowboys by lopsided margins.\n\nThe [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] used the Coliseum as their home ground in both the 1977 and 1981 seasons.\n\nThe Coliseum was also home to the [[United States Football League|USFL]]'s [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] between 1983 and 1985. In this capacity, the stadium also is the site of the longest professional [[American football]] game in history; a triple-overtime game on June 30, 1984 (a few weeks before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics) between the Express and the [[Michigan Panthers]], which was decided on a 24-yard game-winning touchdown by Mel Gray of the Express, 3:33 into the third overtime to give Los Angeles a 27\u201321 win.

These shows were recorded and eight songs from the show of September 30 appear on their box set, entitled ''[[Live 1975\u201385]]''. The September 27 show was released through Springsteen's website on April 5, 2019.\n\n[[U2]] played at the stadium on leg 3 of their breakout Joshua Tree tour in 1987 with two consecutive nights, November 17 and 18, 1987.  They later returned on their Pop Mart tour, June 21, 1997.\n\nLos Angeles natives [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] played at the stadium on December 13, 1987 during the second leg of their ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|\"Girls, Girls, Girls\"]]'' World Tour with fellow [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and Los Angeles-based band [[Guns N' Roses]] as the opening act. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce at the time was one of the most popular and successful musical acts on the planet, while Guns N' Roses was one of the largest up-and-coming acts. Guns N' Roses would later return for four shows in October 1989 as the opening act for The Rolling Stones, then again on September 27, 1992 on their infamous co-headlining [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|tour]] with [[Metallica]].\n\nThe stadium played host to The [[Monsters of Rock Tour 1988|Monsters of Rock]] Festival Tour, featuring [[Van Halen]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Dokken]], Metallica and [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on the 23rd, but was later canceled.\n\nThe stadium also played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[Joan Baez]].\n\n====1990s\u20132000s====\nThe Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; even after they won [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1984, they had trouble filling it. The NFL scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on [[Monday Night Football]] as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out due to the Coliseum not being sold out. Finally, in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Raiders left Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the Coliseum was planned to be the home of the Los Angeles Blaze, a charter franchise of the [[United Baseball League (proposed)|United League]] (UL) which was planned to be a third league of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).\n\nThe [[Legends Football League]] began as a halftime spectacular known as the [[Lingerie Bowl]]. The first 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the Coliseum. From 2009 to 2011, a couple of [[Los Angeles Temptation]] games were played in the Coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the Coliseum after 3 seasons at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in Ontario.\n\nThe 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament was also held at the Coliseum. The [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] beat [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the Gold Cup in the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], [[1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1998]], and [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2000]] tournaments. In October 2000, United States played its last match at the stadium in a friendly versus Mexico. Since then, the team has preferred the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]] and [[Dignity Health Sports Park]] as home stadiums in the Greater Los Angeles.\n\nThe stadium hosted the [[K-1 Dynamite!! USA]] [[mixed martial arts]] event. The promoters claimed that 54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Springer|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-mma3jun03,1,2027204.story|title=Morton doesn't last one round|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1959, the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champion [[New York Yankees]] at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 people.

Conceived as a hallmark of civic pride, the Coliseum was commissioned in 1921 as a memorial to L.A. veterans of World War I. Completed in 1923, it will be the first stadium to have hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] three times: [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].<ref name=\"USC News 2018-03-29\"/> It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] on July 27, 1984, the day before the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"NPS-LANDMARK\" />\n\nThe stadium serves as the home to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) [[USC Trojans football|Trojans football team]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. USC, which operates and manages the Coliseum, granted naming rights to [[United Airlines]] in January 2018; after concerns were raised by Coliseum Commission, the airline became title sponsor of the playing field, naming it '''United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum'''. The stadium is located in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], which is owned by the State of California, and across the street from USC. The Coliseum is jointly owned by the State of California, [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], City of Los Angeles and is managed and operated by the Auxiliary Services Department of the University of Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aux.usc.edu|title=USC Auxiliary Services}}</ref>\n\nIt was the home of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1946 to 1979, when they moved to [[Anaheim Stadium]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]. The Coliseum served as their home stadium again from 2016 to 2019 prior to the team's move to [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. The facility had a permanent seating capacity of 93,607 for USC football and Rams games, making it the largest football stadium in the [[Pac-12 Conference]] and the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theramswire.usatoday.com/2016/12/06/los-angeles-rams-home-attendance-memorial-coliseum-san-diego-chargers/|title=Don't judge Rams home attendance based on percentage of seats filled|date=December 6, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium also was the temporary home of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] from 1958 to 1961 and was the host venue for games 3, 4, and 5 of the [[1959 World Series]]. It was the site of the [[Super Bowl I|First AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later called Super Bowl I, and [[Super Bowl VII]]. Additionally, it has served as a home field for a number of other teams, including the [[1960 Los Angeles Chargers season|1960]] inaugural season for the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] of the NFL, and [[UCLA Bruins football]].\n\nFrom 1959 to 2016, the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] was located adjacent to the Coliseum; the Sports Arena was closed in March 2016 and demolished. [[Banc of California Stadium]], a [[soccer-specific stadium]] and home of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Los Angeles FC]], was constructed on the former Sports Arena site and opened in April 2018.\n\nUSC began a major renovation of the stadium in early 2018.<ref name=\"coliseumrenovation.com\">{{cite web |url=http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |title=The USC Coliseum Renovation Project Website |access-date=January 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226161951/http://coliseumrenovation.com/ |archive-date=February 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the renovation project the seating capacity was  78,467 and became 77,500 upon completion in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.usc.edu/147418/l-a-coliseum-renovation-reaches-halfway-point-with-topping-off-ceremony/|title=Coliseum renovation reaches halfway point with topping-off ceremony|work=USC News|date=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The $315 million project was completed by the 2019 football season and was the first major upgrade of the stadium in twenty years.{{r|Cost $315 M}} The project included replacing the seating along with the addition of [[luxury boxes]] and club suites.\n\n==Operation==\nThe Coliseum is primarily the home of the USC Trojans football team.

When the Coliseum opened in 1923, it was the largest stadium in Los Angeles with a capacity of 75,144. In 1930, however, with the Olympics due in two years, the stadium was extended upward to seventy-nine rows seats with two tiers of tunnels, expanding the seating capacity to 101,574. The now-signature Olympic torch was added. For a time it was known as '''Olympic Stadium'''. The [[Olympic cauldron]] torch which burned through both Games remains above the peristyle at the east end of the stadium as a reminder of this, as do the Olympic rings symbols over one of the main entrances. The football field runs east to west with the press box on the south side of the stadium. The current jumbotrons to each side of the peristyle were installed in 2017 and replaced a scoreboard and video screen that towered over the peristyle dating back to 1983; they replaced a smaller scoreboard above the center arch installed in 1972, which in turn supplanted the 1937 model, one of the first all-electric scoreboards in the nation. Over the years new light towers have been placed along the north and south rims.  The large analog clock and thermometer over the office windows at either end of the peristyle were installed in 1955. In the mid- and late 1950s the press box was renovated and the \"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\" lettering and Olympic rings, lighted at night, were added to the eastern face of the peristyle tower.  Between the double peristyle arches at the east end is the Coliseum's \"Court of Honor\"\u2014plaques recognizing many of the memorable events and participants in Coliseum history, including a full list of 1932 and 1984 Olympic gold medalists. (The complete roster of honorees can be seen below.)\n\n===Renovations===\nFor many years the Coliseum was capable of seating over 100,000 spectators. In 1964 the stadium underwent its first major renovation in over three decades. Most of the original pale green wood-and-metal bench seating was replaced by individual theater-type chairs of dark red, beige, and yellow; these seats remained until 2018, though the yellow color was eliminated in the 1970s. The [[seating capacity]] was reduced to approximately 93,000.\n\nThe Coliseum was problematic as an NFL venue. At various times in its history, it was either the largest or one of the largest stadiums in the NFL. While this allowed the Rams and Raiders to set many NFL attendance records, it also made it extremely difficult to sell out. The NFL amended its [[National Football League television blackout policies|blackout rule]] to allow games to be televised locally if they were sold out 72 hours before kickoff. However, due to the Coliseum's large size, Rams (and later Raiders) games were often blacked out in [[Southern California]] even in the teams' best years.\n\nPartly due to this, from 1964 to the late 1970s it was common practice to shift the playing field to the closed end of the stadium and install end zone bleachers in front of the peristyle, limiting further the number of seats available for sale. For [[University of Southern California|USC]]&ndash;[[UCLA]] and USC-[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] games, which often attracted crowds upward of 90,000, the bleachers were moved eastward and the field was re-marked in its original position. When a larger east grandstand was installed in 1977\u20131978 at the behest of Rams owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the capacity was just 71,500. With the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympic Games, a new track was installed and the playing field permanently placed inside it.  However, the combination of the stadium's large, relatively shallow design, along with the presence of the track between the playing field and the stands, meant that some of the original end zone seats were as far from the field by the equivalent length of another football field. To address these and other problems, the Coliseum underwent a $15 million renovation before the 1993 football season which included the following:<ref name=USCColiseum />\n\n* The field was lowered by {{convert|11|ft|m|1}} and 14 new rows of seats replaced the running track, bringing the first row of seats closer to the playing field (a maximum distance of {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} at the eastern 30-yard-line).\n* A portable seating section was built between the eastern endline and the peristyle bleachers (the stands are removed for concerts and similar events).\n* The locker rooms and public restrooms were modernized.\n* The bleachers were replaced with individual seating.<ref>[http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm Stadiums of the NFL-Los Angeles Coliseum-Los Angeles Rams/Raiders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205140916/http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/LAColiseum.htm |date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, for Raiders home games, [[tarpaulin]]s were placed over seldom-sold sections, reducing [[seating capacity]] to approximately 65,000. The changes were anticipated to be the first of a multi-stage renovation designed by [[HNTB]] that would have turned the Coliseum into a split-bowl stadium with two levels of mezzanine suites (the peristyle end would have been left as is). However, after the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], the $93 million was required from government agencies (including the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]) to repair earthquake damage, and the renovations demanded by the Raiders were put on hold indefinitely. The Raiders then redirected their efforts toward a proposed stadium at [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] before  electing to move back to the [[Oakland Coliseum]] prior to the 1995 NFL season. The last element of the Northridge earthquake repairs was the replacement of the condemned press box with a new press box in 1995.\n\n====New videoboard====\nIn August 2011, construction began on the Coliseum's west end on a new {{convert|6000|sqfoot|adj=on}} [[High-definition video|HD video]] scoreboard, accompanying the existing video scoreboard on the peristyle (east end) of the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2011/04/coliseum-video-board.html|title=USC Official Athletic Site \u2013 USCTrojans.com|website=www.usctrojans.com}}</ref> The video scoreboard officially went into operation on September 3, 2011, at USC football's home opener versus the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]], with the game being televised on [[ABC College Football|ABC]].\n\n====2018\u20132019 renovation project====\nAfter USC took over the Coliseum master lease in 2013, they began making plans for major renovations needed and as stipulated in the master lease agreement.

The Dodgers played here until [[Dodger Stadium]] was completed in time for the 1962 season.  Even allowing for its temporary status, the Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of football and baseball fields. A baseball field requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron, but the playing surface was just barely large enough to accommodate a baseball diamond. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive down the third base line with a very large [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]] for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as {{convert|710|ft|m|0}} from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker rooms were huge, because they were designed for [[American football|football]] (not baseball) teams.\n\nIn order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only {{convert|251|ft|m}} from the plate. This seemed likely to ensure that there would be many \"[[Chinese home run]]s\", as such short shots were called at the time, and sportswriters began jokingly referring to the improvised park as \"O'Malley's Chinese Theatre\"<ref name=\"Mover and Shaker\">{{cite book|last1=McCue|first1=Andy|title=Mover and Shaker: Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers, and Baseball's Westward Expansion|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803255050|pages=221\u201322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA221|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> or \"The House that [[Charlie Chan]] Built\", drawing protests from the [[Chinese American]] community in the Los Angeles area.<ref name=\"Close Shave\">{{cite book|last1=Szalontai|first1=James D.|title=Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie|date=2002|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786411894|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&pg=PA356|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially [[Babe Ruth]]'s 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of {{convert|250|foot|adj=on}} pop flies going over the left-field fence.

In the first week of play during [[1959 Major League Baseball season|the 1959 season]], the media's worst preseason fears seemed to be realized when 24 home runs were hit in the Coliseum, three of them by [[Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Lee Walls]], not especially distinguished as a hitter. But pitchers soon adapted, throwing outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to pull the bat hard if they wanted to hit toward left. Perhaps no player took better advantage than Dodgers outfielder [[Wally Moon]], who figured out how to hit high fly balls that dropped almost vertically just behind the screen. By season's end, he had hit 19 homers, all but 5 of them in the Coliseum. In recognition, such homers were dubbed \"[[Moonshot (baseball)|Moon Shots]].\"<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nNonetheless, the number of home runs alarmed Frick enough that he ordered the Dodgers to build a second screen in the stands, {{convert|333|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the plate. A ball would have had to clear both screens to be a home run; if it cleared the first, it would have been a ground-rule double. However, the Dodgers discovered that the earthquake safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code forbade construction of a second screen.<ref name=\"2008 NYT story\" />\n\nUnable to compel the Dodgers to fix the situation, the major leagues passed a note to Rule 1.04 stating that any stadium constructed after June 1, 1958, must provide a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} down each foul line. Also, when the expansion [[Los Angeles Angels]] joined the [[American League]] for 1961, Frick rejected their original request to use the Coliseum as a temporary facility.<ref name=\"TBT\">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}</ref>  This rule was revoked (or perhaps, simply ignored) when the Baltimore Orioles launched the \"Retro Ballpark\" era in 1993, with the opening of Camden Yards.

However, baseball fans heartily welcomed the \"new/old\" style, and all new ballparks since then have been allowed to set their own distances.\n\n[[File:LA Coliseum 1959 World Series.jpg|thumb|240px|The Coliseum during the [[1959 World Series]]]]\nLate that season, the screen figured in the National League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] race.

According to the ground rules, this should have been a home run. However, the umpires ruled it a ground-rule double. Then the fans shook the screen, causing the ball to fall into the seats. The umpires changed the call to a homer, only to change their minds again and rule it a ground-rule double.<ref name=\"Cathedrals\"/>  Adcock was left stranded on second.

Each of the three games of the 1959 World Series played there drew over 92,000 fans, with game 5 drawing 92,706, a [[Major League Baseball attendance records|record]] unlikely to be seriously threatened anytime soon, given the smaller seating capacities of today's baseball parks. A May 1959 exhibition game between the Dodgers and the [[New York Yankees]] in honor of legendary catcher [[Roy Campanella]] drew 93,103, the largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the Western Hemisphere until an exhibition game in 2008 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the [[Boston Red Sox]] to mark the 50th anniversary of MLB in Los Angeles.

An estimated 40,000 fans were at the Coliseum to see Penhall retain his title before announcing his retirement from [[motorcycle speedway]] to take up an acting role on the [[NBC]] drama series ''[[CHiPs]]''.\n\nLos Angeles hosted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], and the Coliseum became the first stadium to host the [[Summer Olympic Games]] twice; again serving as the primary [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics|track and field]] venue and site of the opening and closing ceremonies.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf 1984 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102235952/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/1984v1pt1.pdf |date=November 2, 2010 }} Volume 1.

These shows were recorded and eight songs from the show of September 30 appear on their box set, entitled ''[[Live 1975\u201385]]''. The September 27 show was released through Springsteen's website on April 5, 2019.\n\n[[U2]] played at the stadium on leg 3 of their breakout Joshua Tree tour in 1987 with two consecutive nights, November 17 and 18, 1987.  They later returned on their Pop Mart tour, June 21, 1997.\n\nLos Angeles natives [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] played at the stadium on December 13, 1987 during the second leg of their ''[[Girls, Girls, Girls (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|\"Girls, Girls, Girls\"]]'' World Tour with fellow [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and Los Angeles-based band [[Guns N' Roses]] as the opening act. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce at the time was one of the most popular and successful musical acts on the planet, while Guns N' Roses was one of the largest up-and-coming acts. Guns N' Roses would later return for four shows in October 1989 as the opening act for The Rolling Stones, then again on September 27, 1992 on their infamous co-headlining [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|tour]] with [[Metallica]].\n\nThe stadium played host to The [[Monsters of Rock Tour 1988|Monsters of Rock]] Festival Tour, featuring [[Van Halen]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Dokken]], Metallica and [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], on July 24, 1988. A second show was planned to take place on the 23rd, but was later canceled.\n\nThe stadium also played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[Human Rights Now!]] Benefit Concert on September 21, 1988. The show was headlined by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] and also featured Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[Joan Baez]].\n\n====1990s\u20132000s====\nThe Raiders began looking to move out of the Coliseum as early as 1986. In addition to the delays in renovating the stadium, they never drew well; even after they won [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in 1984, they had trouble filling it. The NFL scheduled all of the Raiders' appearances on [[Monday Night Football]] as road games since the Los Angeles market would have been blacked out due to the Coliseum not being sold out. Finally, in [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the Raiders left Los Angeles and returned to Oakland, leaving the Coliseum without a professional football tenant for the first time since the close of World War II.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the Coliseum was planned to be the home of the Los Angeles Blaze, a charter franchise of the [[United Baseball League (proposed)|United League]] (UL) which was planned to be a third league of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).\n\nThe [[Legends Football League]] began as a halftime spectacular known as the [[Lingerie Bowl]]. The first 3 years (2004, 2005, 2006) were played at the Coliseum. From 2009 to 2011, a couple of [[Los Angeles Temptation]] games were played in the Coliseum. Beginning in 2015, the Temptation resumed playing at the Coliseum after 3 seasons at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in Ontario.\n\nThe 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament was also held at the Coliseum. The [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] beat [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in the final. The Coliseum also staged the final match of the Gold Cup in the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], [[1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1998]], and [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2000]] tournaments. In October 2000, United States played its last match at the stadium in a friendly versus Mexico. Since then, the team has preferred the [[Rose Bowl Stadium]] and [[Dignity Health Sports Park]] as home stadiums in the Greater Los Angeles.\n\nThe stadium hosted the [[K-1 Dynamite!! USA]] [[mixed martial arts]] event. The promoters claimed that 54,000 people attended the event, which would have set a new attendance record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States; however, other officials estimated the crowd between 20,000 and 30,000.<ref>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Springer|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-mma3jun03,1,2027204.story|title=Morton doesn't last one round|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1959, the Dodgers had hosted an exhibition game against the reigning World Series champion [[New York Yankees]] at the Coliseum, a game which drew over 93,000 people.

For [[Super Bowl VII]] in 1973, which matched the [[Miami Dolphins]] against the [[Washington Redskins]], the attendance was a near-capacity 90,182, a record that would stand until [[Super Bowl XI]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. The 1975 NFC Championship Game between the Los Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys had an attendance of 88,919, still the largest crowd for a conference championship game since the conference-title format began with the 1970 season.  The 1983 AFC Championship Game between the Raiders and [[Seattle Seahawks]] attracted 88,734.\n\nThe Rams'  first NFL game at the Coliseum  since 1979,  after spending fifteen years at Anaheim Stadium and then twenty-one seasons in St. Louis, a pre-season contest against the Cowboys on  August 13, 2016, drew a crowd of 89,140.
