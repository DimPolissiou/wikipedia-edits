He is best known for his style of combining rapid-fire raps, double harmony choruses, with a soft-spoken and high-pitched delivery. His solo debut, ''[[Heaven'z Movie]],'' was critically acclaimed and certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]].\n\n''[[The Gift (Bizzy Bone album)|The Gift]]'', released on April 7, 2001, peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts|US Billboard Independent Albums]] chart. Many of the songs on the album dealt with his personal life and childhood.\n\nIn 2004, Bizzy released ''[[Alpha and Omega (Bizzy Bone album)|Alpha and Omega]]'' which showed a change in his musical and lyrical content. Fans responded positively to the album.{{cn|date= December 2019}} Bizzy followed up with the limited-edition internet album ''[[The Beginning and the End (Bizzy Bone album)|The Beginning and the End]]''. Next, he released ''[[Speaking In Tongues]]'' on September 27, 2005. The title references an incident in which Bizzy Bone went on a spiritual rant during an interview on Houston radio station KPFT FM, speaking in tongues. It was met with positive reviews from critics, praising its [[lo-fi]] sounding quality and Bizzy's unhinged lyricism. He released four studio albums in 2006. Two of them, ''The Story'' and ''Midwest Cowboy'', performed well on the charts, garnering further positive reviews from music critics.\n\nIn 2008, Bizzy Bone reunited with Layzie Bone re-form [[Bone Brothers]] and release two new studio albums, ''Bone Brothers III'' and ''Still Creepin' On Ah Come Up'' (released and credited solely as \"Bone Thugs\"). That year, Bizzy also  released two new solo albums. The first, an independent release ''Ruthless'', features  guest appearances from [[Rick Ross]] and [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. The other album was his major label release for After Platinum Records distributed through [[Virgin Records]], ''A Song For You'', which featured appearances from [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], Joel Madden of [[Good Charlotte]], [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], and [[Twista]]. ''A Song For You'' was heralded by music critics as Bizzy's best album in years, if not the best of his entire solo career.{{cn|date= December 2019}}\n\nIn 2010, Bizzy Bone was one of the ensemble of featured artists for \"We Are The World 25 for Haiti\" after the country was devastated, left in ruins by a massive earthquake. The song was critically panned by music critics. 2010 would soon see the release of Bizzy Bone's first rap rock album titled ''Crossroads 2010'' on [[Sumerian Records]]. The album received positive feedback from fans and critics alike.\n\nOn September 12, 2019, Bizzy released his first album in five years, ''Carbon Monoxide''. Its title track is a direct response to the [[Migos]] for their disrespect towards Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and other artists from their era, claiming they (Migos), were the \"Greatest Group of All-Time.\" Bizzy's fellow group member Layzie Bone publicly challenged these claims and also released a diss track towards Migos and [[21 Savage]] after the latter came to the defense of Migos, while in the process dissing Layzie Bone calling him \"old, broke\" and that he could have sex with Layzie's wife. Bizzy reacted apparently intoxicated live on Instagram, threatening to kill Migos and 21 Savage for their disrespect with a double barrel shotgun, which ended abruptly with the police coming to his home in response. The video soon went viral, in the event of the gun resembling [[Elmer Fudd]] the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon character. This resulted in several memes, parody videos and commentary from other artists. ''Carbon Monoxide'' debuted #3 on the [[iTunes]] album chart.{{cn| date= December 2019}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn Feb 1, 2020, Bryon married Jessica Nancy Cassidy also known as JCass.

Then, in one of my occasional perusals of ''Finnegans Wake'', by James Joyce, I came across the word \"quark\" in the phrase \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\". Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with \"Mark\", as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"[[portmanteau]]\" words in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified.

The theory that describes strong interactions is called [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a [[bound state|bound system]] with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ''\u03be'' plus an antiquark with color charge \u2212''\u03be'' will result in a color charge of 0 (or \"white\" color) and the formation of a [[meson]]. This is analogous to the [[additive color]] model in basic [[optics]]. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same \"white\" color charge and the formation of a [[baryon]] or [[antibaryon]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=B.

Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part of a more general formulation known as [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a [[virtual particle|virtual]] emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red\u2013antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red\u2013antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=R. P.

Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks, [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]], to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge.<ref name=\"Gell-Man1964\"/><ref name=\"Zweig1964a\"/><ref name=\"Zweig1964b\"/> The initial reaction of the physics community to the proposal was mixed.

[[Sheldon Lee Glashow]] and [[James Bjorken]] predicted the existence of a fourth flavor of quark, which they called ''charm''. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the [[weak interaction]] (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known [[lepton]]s, and implied a [[mass formula]] that correctly reproduced the masses of the known [[meson]]s.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author1=B.

Since \"quark\" (meaning, for one thing, the cry of the gull) was clearly intended to rhyme with \"Mark\", as well as \"bark\" and other such words, I had to find an excuse to pronounce it as \"kwork\". But the book represents the dream of a publican named Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker. Words in the text are typically drawn from several sources at once, like the \"[[portmanteau]]\" words in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. From time to time, phrases occur in the book that are partially determined by calls for drinks at the bar. I argued, therefore, that perhaps one of the multiple sources of the cry \"Three quarks for Muster Mark\" might be \"Three quarts for Mister Mark\", in which case the pronunciation \"kwork\" would not be totally unjustified.

A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a [[bound state|bound system]] with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ''\u03be'' plus an antiquark with color charge \u2212''\u03be'' will result in a color charge of 0 (or \"white\" color) and the formation of a [[meson]]. This is analogous to the [[additive color]] model in basic [[optics]].

Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part of a more general formulation known as [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a [[virtual particle|virtual]] emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red\u2013antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red\u2013antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=R. P.

It began with the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937 in which a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops escalated into a battle.

The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production. The [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant nationalism, culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a new puppet state, [[Manchukuo]]; many historians cite 1931 as the beginning of the war.<ref name=\"Hotta2007\">{{cite book|last=Hotta|first=E.|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kih_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|date=25 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-60992-1|page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"Paine2012\">{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called \"incidents\".\n\nFollowing the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939\u201340 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive in Central China]].\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. The following day the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China by airlifting material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]].\n\nOn August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria]], Japan capitulated to Allied forces.  Japan continued to occupy part of China's territory until it formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]]. The remaining Japanese occupation forces (excluding Manchuria) formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.\n\nAt the outcome of the [[Cairo Conference]] of November 22\u201326, 1943, the Allies of World War II had decided to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan by restoring all the territories that Japan annexed from China, including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Pescadores]], to China, and to expel Japan from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. China was recognized as one of the [[Four Policemen|Big Four of the Allies]] during the war and became one of the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{sfnp|Mitter|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bqc_YkuyaCIC&pg=PA369 369]}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HymSg_Pp7X0C&pg=PA223 |title= The New York Times Living History: World War II, 1942\u20131945: The Allied Counteroffensive|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas |accessdate=1 September 2015|isbn= 9780805072471|year= 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620101548/http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|archive-date=June 20, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], convened between 1946 and 1948, [[Criminal procedure|tried]] and punished the Japanese leaders for waging war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Allied Commander-in-Chief in the China theatre from 1942 to 1945]]\n[[File:WW2 Documentary \u4e8c\u6230\u7d00\u9304\u7247Part 1 of 7.ogg|thumb|left|The beginning of the war]]\n\nIn China, the war is most commonly known as the \"War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh| t=\u6297\u65e5\u6230\u722d| s=\u6297\u65e5\u6218\u4e89}}), and shortened to the \"Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh|\u6297\u65e5}}) or the \"War of Resistance\" ({{zh| s=\u6297\u6218| t=\u6297\u6230|links=no}}).

From the Japanese perspective was that localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively. A formal expression of these conflicts would potentially lead to American embargo in accordance with the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s]].<ref name=en>Jerald A. Combs.

Unifying the nation and repelling imperialism seemed a very remote possibility.{{sfn|Wilson|page=4}} Some warlords even aligned themselves with various foreign powers in their battles with each other.

Under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]], China remained fragmented and was unable to resist foreign incursions.{{sfn|Taylor|page=33}} For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, alternatively known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Taylor|page=57}}\n\n===Jinan incident===\n{{Main|Jinan incident}}\n\nThe [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military violently killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.{{sfn|Taylor|page=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|page=82}}\n\n===Reunification of China (1928)===\n{{Main|Chinese reunification (1928)}}\n\nAs the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] by the Kwantung Army in 1928.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 121</ref> His son, [[Zhang Xueliang]], took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria.

The Soviet [[Red Army]] victory over [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.<ref>Michael M. Walker, ''The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2017), p. 290.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.<ref>Michael M.

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ({{zh|c=\u6518\u5916\u5fc5\u5148\u5b89\u5167|links=no}}).\n\n==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==\n{{anchor|occupation}}\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]\n\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144</ref>\n\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.\n\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]\nIn 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].\n\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=\u83ef\u5317\u7279\u6b8a\u5316|p=hu\u00e1b\u011bit\u00e8sh\u016bh\u00f9a|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].\n\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He\u2013Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u20131936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===\n[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July\u2013August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]], as it came to be called, strongly shook public opinion within Japan.\n\n===Battle of Shanghai===\n{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]\n\nThe [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the \"breaking point\" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u20131945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]\n\nOn August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].

These campaigns involved approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese.

They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March\u2013April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were expelled from their homes. About 800,000 drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger.\n\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.\n\n===1939\u201340: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===\n[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\n\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general.

However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\n\n===Japanese expansion===\n[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]\n\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas.

In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: \"the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart\". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.\n\n[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March\u2013April 1938]]\n\nEven under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.\n\nAfterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of \"trading space for time\" ({{zh|s=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6362\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4|t=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u9593\u63db\u53d6\u6642\u9593|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]] which causes thousands of death and many more seeking refuge.\n\n====Second period (October 1938 \u2013 December 1941)====\n[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]\n\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\n\nLocal Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|\u4e09\u5149\u653f\u7b56}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S\u0101ngu\u0101ng Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank\u014d Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.\n\nBy 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (\"points and lines\"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.\n\n===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===\n[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]\n\nAfter the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to \"improvise\" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].\n\n[[File:Lin Biao in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|115th Division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] Commander-in-chief [[Lin Biao]] in NRA uniform]]\n\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.\n\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as \"[[Mao Zedong Thought]]\". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news\n|title=Crisis\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=November 13, 1944}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the Western Allies===\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of war|War declaration]] against Japan by the Chongqing Nationalist Government in 9 December 1941]]\n[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang]] with [[Lieutenant General]] [[Joseph Stilwell]] in 1942, [[British Burma|Burma]]]]\n[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|On February 18, 1943, [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]\n[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|A US poster advocating helping China fight on]]\n\nFollowing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.<ref name=\"China Declares War\">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]].

However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over \"[[The Hump]]\".

For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].\n\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, \"Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War\", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243\u2013259.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D.

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"[[Europe first|Europe First]]\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed.

The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\n\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\n\nThe [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.\n\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\n\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]\n\nThe question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.\n\nIn the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name=\"China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\u2014New York Times\">{{Cite news\n|title=China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D81431F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=Hu%20jintao%20Victory%20Japan&st=cse\n|work=New York Times\n|date=September 4, 2005\n| first=Joseph\n| last=Kahn\n| accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing\" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, \"The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War\", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32\u201336</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===China-Japan relations===\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan.

However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters.

The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria).<ref name=\"Yomiuri Shimbun\"/>\n\nAnother source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers.

From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>{{efn|This number does not include the casualties of the large numbers of Chinese collaborator government troops fighting on the Japanese side.|group=efn}} From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war's end.

In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower.

The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production. The [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant nationalism, culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a new puppet state, [[Manchukuo]]; many historians cite 1931 as the beginning of the war.<ref name=\"Hotta2007\">{{cite book|last=Hotta|first=E.|title=Pan-Asianism and Japan's War 1931-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kih_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|date=25 December 2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-0-230-60992-1|page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"Paine2012\">{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called \"incidents\".\n\nFollowing the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939\u201340 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive in Central China]].\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. The following day the [[United States declaration of war upon Japan|United States declared war on Japan]]. The United States began to aid China by airlifting material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]] after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] defeat in [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]] that closed the [[Burma Road]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]].\n\nOn August 15, 1945, following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria]], Japan capitulated to Allied forces.  Japan continued to occupy part of China's territory until it formally [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered on September 2, 1945]]. The remaining Japanese occupation forces (excluding Manchuria) formally surrendered on September 9, 1945.\n\nAt the outcome of the [[Cairo Conference]] of November 22\u201326, 1943, the Allies of World War II had decided to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan by restoring all the territories that Japan annexed from China, including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Pescadores]], to China, and to expel Japan from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. China was recognized as one of the [[Four Policemen|Big Four of the Allies]] during the war and became one of the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{sfnp|Mitter|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bqc_YkuyaCIC&pg=PA369 369]}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HymSg_Pp7X0C&pg=PA223 |title= The New York Times Living History: World War II, 1942\u20131945: The Allied Counteroffensive|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas |accessdate=1 September 2015|isbn= 9780805072471|year= 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620101548/http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|archive-date=June 20, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], convened between 1946 and 1948, [[Criminal procedure|tried]] and punished the Japanese leaders for waging war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek in full uniform.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Allied Commander-in-Chief in the China theatre from 1942 to 1945]]\n[[File:WW2 Documentary \u4e8c\u6230\u7d00\u9304\u7247Part 1 of 7.ogg|thumb|left|The beginning of the war]]\n\nIn China, the war is most commonly known as the \"War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh| t=\u6297\u65e5\u6230\u722d| s=\u6297\u65e5\u6218\u4e89}}), and shortened to the \"Resistance against Japanese Aggression\" ({{zh|\u6297\u65e5}}) or the \"War of Resistance\" ({{zh| s=\u6297\u6218| t=\u6297\u6230|links=no}}).

From the Japanese perspective was that localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively. A formal expression of these conflicts would potentially lead to American embargo in accordance with the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s]].<ref name=en>Jerald A. Combs.

Unifying the nation and repelling imperialism seemed a very remote possibility.{{sfn|Wilson|page=4}} Some warlords even aligned themselves with various foreign powers in their battles with each other.

Under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]], China remained fragmented and was unable to resist foreign incursions.{{sfn|Taylor|page=33}} For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, alternatively known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Taylor|page=57}}\n\n===Jinan incident===\n{{Main|Jinan incident}}\n\nThe [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military violently killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.{{sfn|Taylor|page=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|page=82}}\n\n===Reunification of China (1928)===\n{{Main|Chinese reunification (1928)}}\n\nAs the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] by the Kwantung Army in 1928.<ref>Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 121</ref> His son, [[Zhang Xueliang]], took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria.

The Soviet [[Red Army]] victory over [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.<ref>Michael M. Walker, ''The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2017), p. 290.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.<ref>Michael M.

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of \"first internal pacification, then external resistance\" ({{zh|c=\u6518\u5916\u5fc5\u5148\u5b89\u5167|links=no}}).\n\n==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==\n{{anchor|occupation}}\n[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]\n\nThe internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were \"more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents\".<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144</ref>\n\nAfter five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.\n\nIncessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarisation]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.\n[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]\nIn 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].\n\nJapan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=\u83ef\u5317\u7279\u6b8a\u5316|p=hu\u00e1b\u011bit\u00e8sh\u016bh\u00f9a|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].\n\nThis Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He\u2013Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei\u2013Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u20131936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].\n\n==Course of the war==\n\n===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===\n[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]\n\nOn the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to Beijing. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a full-scale battle in which [[Battle of Beiping\u2013Tianjin|Beijing]] and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July\u2013August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]], as it came to be called, strongly shook public opinion within Japan.\n\n===Battle of Shanghai===\n{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]\n\nThe [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the \"breaking point\" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u20131945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.\n\n[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]\n\nOn August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]].

These campaigns involved approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese.

They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March\u2013April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} The Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were expelled from their homes. About 800,000 drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger.\n\nWith Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving millions dead, injured, and homeless.\n\n===1939\u201340: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===\n[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]\n[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]\n\nFrom the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian\u2013Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939\u20131940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general.

However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.\n\n===Japanese expansion===\n[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]\n\nBy 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas.

In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: \"the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart\". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.\n\n[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March\u2013April 1938]]\n\nEven under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.\n\nAfterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of \"trading space for time\" ({{zh|s=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u95f4\u6362\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4|t=\u4ee5\u7a7a\u9593\u63db\u53d6\u6642\u9593|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, in which [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]] which causes thousands of death and many more seeking refuge.\n\n====Second period (October 1938 \u2013 December 1941)====\n[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]\n\nDuring this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy \"winning by outlasting\". The NRA adopted the concept of \"magnetic warfare\" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, [[Flanking maneuver|flanking attacks]], and [[encirclement]]s in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.\n\nLocal Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the \"[[Three Alls Policy]]\" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|\u4e09\u5149\u653f\u7b56}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''S\u0101ngu\u0101ng Zh\u00e8ngc\u00e8'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sank\u014d Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.\n\nBy 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities (\"points and lines\"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.\n\n===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===\n[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]\n\nAfter the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the \"young marshal\" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to \"improvise\" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].\n\n[[File:Lin Biao in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|115th Division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] Commander-in-chief [[Lin Biao]] in NRA uniform]]\n\nDespite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled \"collaborators\" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.\n\nAfterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as \"[[Mao Zedong Thought]]\". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.<ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE>{{Cite news\n|title=Crisis\n|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801570-4,00.html\n|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\n|date=November 13, 1944}}</ref>\n\n===Entrance of the Western Allies===\n[[File:1941 Chinese War Declaration vs Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Declaration of war|War declaration]] against Japan by the Chongqing Nationalist Government in 9 December 1941]]\n[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang]] with [[Lieutenant General]] [[Joseph Stilwell]] in 1942, [[British Burma|Burma]]]]\n[[File:Madamn Chiang Kaishek US Congress speech(1).ogg|thumb|On February 18, 1943, [[Soong Mei-ling|Madame Chiang Kai-shek]] addressed both houses of the US Congress.]]\n[[File:United China Relief1.jpg|thumb|A US poster advocating helping China fight on]]\n\nFollowing the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.<ref name=\"China Declares War\">{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref> As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]].

However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over \"[[The Hump]]\".

For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of mat\u00e9riel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].\n\nChiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of outwaiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.<ref>Hans Van de Ven, \"Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War\", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243\u2013259.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D.

British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' \"[[Europe first|Europe First]]\" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed.

The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.\n\nFurthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.\n\nThe problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.\n\nThe [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.\n\nMao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.\n\nHowever, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]\n\nThe question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.\n\nIn the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.<ref name=\"China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\u2014New York Times\">{{Cite news\n|title=China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D81431F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63&scp=1&sq=Hu%20jintao%20Victory%20Japan&st=cse\n|work=New York Times\n|date=September 4, 2005\n| first=Joseph\n| last=Kahn\n| accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should \"save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing\" by the end of 1941.<ref>Yang Kuisong, \"The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War\", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32\u201336</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===China-Japan relations===\nToday, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan.

However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.\n\nMeanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters.

The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria).<ref name=\"Yomiuri Shimbun\"/>\n\nAnother source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers.

From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>{{efn|This number does not include the casualties of the large numbers of Chinese collaborator government troops fighting on the Japanese side.|group=efn}} From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war's end.

In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower.
