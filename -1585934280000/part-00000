The Automoto team had [[Ottavio Bottecchia]], the winner of the last two editions of the race, and [[Lucien Buysse]], the runner-up of the previous edition. The Alcyon team had [[Bartolomeo Aymo]] and [[Nicolas Frantz]], third and fourth in 1925.

In 1926, this was decreased to 17 stages. Tour organiser [[Henri Desgrange]] wanted to have longer stages, so the average stage length increased from 312&nbsp;km per stage in 1925 to 338&nbsp;km per stage in 1926.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=80\u201384}}\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1926 Tour de France}}\n\nThere were 126 cyclists who started the Tour de France; 82 of them were touriste-routiers, cyclists who did not have the support from a team. The other 44 cyclists started the race in teams; some teams only had two cyclists.<ref name=\"mdc1926\"/>\n\n==Pre-race favourites==\nThe two teams with favourites were Automoto and Alcyon. The Automoto team had [[Ottavio Bottecchia]], the winner of the last two editions of the race, and [[Lucien Buysse]], the runner-up of the previous edition. The Alcyon team had [[Bartolomeo Aymo]] and [[Nicolas Frantz]], third and fourth in 1925. They also had [[Adelin Benoit]], and the Tour organisation thought that the battle would be between Bottecchia and Benoit.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=80\u201384}}\n\n==Race overview==\n{{main|1926 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 9|1926 Tour de France, Stage 10 to Stage 17}}\n[[File:Buysse gadegeslagen door een koe Buysse passing a cow.jpg|thumb|[[Jules Buysse]] leading, who will win the first stage (Evian to Mulhouse).]]\n[[Jules Buysse]] started strong in the first stage, by finishing solo with a margin of more than 13 minutes. The second stage ended with a bunch sprint, so nothing changed in the general classification. In the third stage, he lost the lead to Gustaaf van Slembrouck. On that day, Lucien Buysse received the news that his daughter had died. He considered to leave the race, but decided to stay.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=80\u201384}}\nThe next stages all ended in bunch sprints, with all the favourites in the first group.

The winner of the previous edition, Bottecchia, said that he would retire from cycling, after the difficulties he faced in the 1926 Tour de France.\n\nThe Tour de France organisation did not like the outcome of the 1926 Tour de France, as 10 of the 17 stages had finished in bunch sprints.

It is now an Italian state museum, and is listed as a [[World Heritage Sites|UNESCO world heritage site]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ippolito II d'Este.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, creator of the Villa d'Este and its gardens]]\nThe Villa was commissioned by Cardinal [[Ippolito II d'Este]] (1509\u20131572), second son of [[Alfonso I d'Este]], the Duke of Ferrara and grandson of [[Pope Alexander VI]], along with [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. The Este family had been lords of Ferrara since 1393, and were famous as patrons of the arts and of the humanist scholars of the [[Renaissance]]. As a second son, Ippolito was destined for a career in the church; he was named archbishop of Milan when he was only ten years old. At the age of 27, he was sent to the French court, where he became an advisor to the French King, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and in 1540 became a member of the King's Private Council. At the age of thirty, at the request of the King, [[Pope Paul III]] made d'Este a cardinal. Thanks to his ecclesiastical and royal connections, he became one of the wealthiest cardinals of the time, with an annual income estimated at 120,000 ''scudi''. He was a lavish patron of the arts, supporting among others the sculptor [[Benvenuto Cellini]], the musician [[Pierluigi da Palestrina]] and the poet [[Torquato Tasso]].  While his income was enormous, he was always in debt. The new French King, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], sent him as an envoy to Rome, where he played a major role in the social and political life of the city. He appeared destined to become Pope and used all of his money and influence toward that goal, but at the time of the [[Reformation]] and the [[Council of Trent]], his extravagant style of life worked against him.\nHis first candidacy for the papal position, in 1549, with the support of the French King, was blocked by the Habsburg Emperor. D'Este promptly withdrew his own candidacy, endorsed the Habsburg candidate, and was rewarded by the College of Cardinals on December 3, 1549 with the lifetime position of Governor of Tivoli. This new title suited d'Este, because he was already a passionate collector of antiquities, and it gave him jurisdiction over the site of Hadrian's villa and other sites just being excavated. He did not give up his ambition to become Pope. He was five times a candidate for Pope, but was never selected.{{Sfn|Barisi|page=8}}\n[[File:Pirro Ligorio 1.gif|thumb|left|200px|[[Pirro Ligorio]], the artist and classical scholar who planned the themes and symbolism of the Villa and gardens]]\nTivoli had been a popular summer residence since ancient Roman times due to its altitude, cooler temperatures and its proximity to the [[Villa Hadriana]], the summer residence of the Emperor [[Hadrian|Hadrian I]]. The position of Governor of Tivoli came with an official residence located in a former convent of the [[Benedictine]] order, which had been built in the 9th century on the site of an old Roman villa. In 1256 it had been donated to the Franciscan order. The residence was not large enough for the enormous household of a Cardinal as prominent as d'Este, but it did have a spectacular view of the countryside below, including Hadrian's villa, and an abundant natural water supply for fountains and gardens. D'Este commissioned a prominent classical scholar, [[Pirro Ligorio]], who had studied the Villa Hadriana and other Roman sites the vicinity, to plan a new villa and garden which would exceed anything the Romans had built. He obtained an abundant supply of marble and statuary from the ruins of Hadrian's villa. {{Sfn|Barisi|pages=8-9}}\n\n[[File:Dup\u00e9rac, \u00c9tienne - Gardens at Villa d'Este - 1560-1575.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Villa and gardens in 1560\u20131575]]\n\nThe land was acquired and construction was planned to begin at the end of 1550, but the Cardinal was distracted by various diplomatic missions; he was posted to northern Italy to resolve a war in Parma, then sent by Henry II on a mission to Sienna. He did not return to Tivoli until the summer of 1555. In September 1555, however, he was accused of [[simony]] by Pope [[Paul IV]] and exiled. The Pope died in 1559, and the new pontiff, [[Pope Pius IV]], rehabilitated d'Este and restored his title as governor of Tivoli. Construction began when he returned in July 1560. More land was needed and acquired through 1569. The vast construction site required the demolition of houses, public buildings and roads. In 1568 the local residents filed twelve different lawsuits against the Cardinal, but did not deter him from his project. Between 1563 and 1565, a huge amount of earth was excavated and used to construct new terraces; arcades, grottos, niches, and nymphaeums were constructed. The nearby river Aniene was diverted to furnish water for the complex system of pools, water jets, channels, fountains, cascades and [[jeux d'eau|water games]]. The steep slope of the garden; more than {{convert|45|m}} from top to bottom, posed special challenges. Canals were dug and {{convert|200|m}} of underground pipes were laid to carry the water from the artificial mountain under the oval fountain to the rest of the garden. Following the aesthetic principles of the Renaissance, the garden was carefully divided into regular units, or compartments, each {{convert|30|m}} across, laid out along a longitudinal median axis, with five lateral axes.  {{Sfn|Barisi|pages=10-11}}\n\nThe plans for the villa itself were carried out under the direction of the Ferrarese architect-engineer [[Alberto Galvani]], court architect of the [[House of Este|Este]]. The chief painter of the ambitious internal decoration was [[Livio Agresti]] from [[Forl\u00ec]]. In 1565 and 1566, work began on the decoration of the interior of the villa.  The decoration was carried out by a team of painters under Girolamo Muziano and [[Federico Zuccari]]. In 1566, the Cardinal made his fifth effort to be elected Pope, but once again he was defeated, and he was excluded by the new pontiff, [[Pope Pius V]], from any more official appointments. He turned more and more of his attention to the decoration of his villa. New teams of painters and stucco workers labored on the task between 1567 and 1572, under the direction of Girolamo Muziano, Livio Agresti, Cesare Nebbia, Durante Alberti, Metteo Neroni, and [[Federico Zuccari]].{{Sfn|Barisi|page=12}} The painters were joined by sculptors Giovan Battista della Porta. Pirrino del Galgliardo, Gillis van den Vliete, Giovanni Malanca, and Pierre de la Motte.  They were joined by ceramists and mosaic artists, as well as fountain engineers, led by Pirro Ligorio, the original designer of the project, who returned to finish the work in 1567\u201368.\n\nThe frantic work on the project began to slow in 1569, probably due to the financial difficulties of the Cardinal, who had no more hope of being elected Pope and had lost his lucrative French positions. He spent more and more of his time in the villa, reading and meeting with the leading poets, artists and philosophers of the Renaissance. In the summer of 1572, he entertained one last important guest, [[Pope Gregory XIII]]. To prepare for the visit, the Cardinal redecorated the top floors of the villa and rushed completion of the dragon fountain. The reception for the Pope cost him more than five thousand ''scudi'' forcing him to pawn his silver and other precious objects. Soon after the reception, on December 2, 1572, the Cardinal died in Rome, and was buried in a simple tomb in the church adjoining the Villa.{{Sfn|Barisi|page=13}}\n\n===The Villa in later years===\n[[Image:Carl Blechen 007.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Park of the Villa d'Este'', [[Carl Blechen]], 1830. The overgrown garden appealed to the [[Romanticism|Romantic imagination]]; today this same view is once again manicured.]]\nWith the death of Ippolito in 1572, the villa and gardens passed to his nephew, Cardinal Luigi (1538\u20131586), who continued work on some of the unfinished fountains and gardens, but struggled with high maintenance costs. After his death in 1586, it was owned by the Cardinal Deacons of the Sacred College, who did little to maintain villa. In 1599 it returned to the Este family with the nomination of Cardinal Alessandro d'Este (1538\u20131624). Alessandro had the energy and ambition of his ancestor and carried out a major renovation of the gardens and water systems, as well as building a new system of fountains in the lower garden. He also persuaded Pope Gregory XV to formally grant ownership of the villa to the Este family. His successors, the Dukes of Modena, made further additions to the gardens. Francesco I (1629-1641) restored many of the crumbling structures and began planting trees in the previously unshaded gardens. Cardinal Rinaldo I commissioned two new fountains by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1660\u201361. However, after 1695, the Este family was unable to support the high cost of maintaining the villa, which they rarely used and which produced no income. The villa went into a long decline. After 1751, the furnishings were sent to Modena, and the antique sculpture was gradually removed from the gardens and sold to collectors. In 1796, the [[House of Habsburg]] took possession of the villa, after [[Ercole III d'Este, Duke of Modena|Ercole III d'Este]] bequeathed it to his daughter [[Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este|Maria Beatrice]], married to [[Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este|Grand Duke Ferdinand of Habsburg]]. It was largely neglected and was twice occupied by French soldiers, who took away much of the decoration that remained.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1896, the villa was owned by Cardinal Gustav von Hohenlohe, who restored the dilapidated villa and the ruined and overgrown gardens, which now appealed to the romantic sentiments of the period. The villa once again attracted artists, musicians and writers. The composer [[Franz Liszt]] made several visits between 1865 and 1885, and wrote three pieces of piano music, two musical \"[[Threnody|threnodies]]\" with the title \"Aux cypr\u00e8s de la Villa d\u2019Este\" and the [[character piece]] \"Les jeux d'eau \u00e0 la Villa d'Este,\" that depict the grounds.  They were placed in the \"third year\" of his [[Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage]].  The latter includes some of the most influential evocations of the play of water ever written for piano.\n\nAfter the First World War, the villa was acquired by the Italian State, which began a major restoration in 1922. The villa was refurnished with paintings from the storerooms of the Galleria Nazionale, Rome. It suffered bomb damage in 1944 during World War II, and many of the walls were degraded in postwar years by environmental pollution, but campaigns of restoration and protection have managed to preserve intact the famous features of the villa and gardens. [[Jean Garrigue]]'s volume of poems ''A Water Walk by Villa d'Este'' (1959) was inspired by the gardens. [[Kenneth Anger]] filmed ''[[Eaux d'Artifice]]'' among the water features of the garden.  The famous [[water organ]], which had not functioned for many years, was restored and now plays again each day for visitors.  {{Sfn|Barisi|pages=14-15}}\n\n==The Villa==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este garden 8.jpg|The Villa seen from the gardens\nFile:Villa Deste entrance 2011 1.jpg|The modest modern entrance to the Villa,  next to the Church of Santa-Maria Maggiore\nFile:Villa d'Este din Tivoli2.jpg|The Courtyard of the Villa was originally the cloister of the convent\nFile:Villa d'Este fuente patio.jpg|The Fountain of Venus in the courtyard retains its original appearance\n</gallery>\nToday the villa is entered from a doorway on the Piazza Trento, next to the entrance of the Church of Santa-Maria Maggiore.  In the time of Ippolito d'Este, this entrance was rarely used;  visitors arrived at the bottom of the gardens, and ascended, step by step, to the villa, viewing the fountains and statuary.  The current door dates to 1521, to the period before Ippolito.  The '''foyer''' inside the door has a painted vault which was once covered with paintings, which were largely destroyed by the bombing during World War II.\nIt was decorated with monochrome scenes from the Old Testament, a few of which, including The Sacrifice of Isaac, still can be seen. They date to the period between 1563\u201365, and were probably designed by GIrolamo Muziano The next room, the '''Hall of the Stories of Solomon''', shows scenes from life of King Solomon, set in frames painted to resemble marble.  They also are attributed to Muziano and his craftsmen, is also from about 1565.  A massive head of travertine stone is on display here, which until the 18th century was in the garden.\n\nThe '''Courtyard''' is placed where the original cloister of the convent was located.  It was constructed in 1566\u201367, and is surrounded by a gallery. The centerpiece of the courtyard is the '''Fountain of Venus''', the only fountain in the Villa which retains its original appearance and decoration. The fountain, designed by Raffaelo Sangallo in 1568\u201369, is framed by two doric columns, and crowned by a 4th-century marble bust of the Emperor Constatine. The central element of the fountain is a Roman statue of a sleeping Venus, made in the 4th or 5th centuries A.D.  Water originally poured from a vase beside her into a Roman [[labrum (architecture)|labrum]] of white marble (2nd century AD) decorated with two lion heads. The fountain is surrounded on three sides by a sixteenth-century courtyard sited on the former Benedictine cloister. The fountain on a side wall contains a grotto and a figure which follows a Hellenistic prototype most familiar in the ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'' of the Vatican. The grotto, epitomized by the high-relief stalactites, identifies her as the resident nymph, or ''[[genius loci]]'', though guidebooks sometimes call her a ''Venus''.  The base of the fountain is decorated with a stucco bas relief which was once gilded, and portrays the white heraldic eagles of the D'Este. It illustrates the course of the river flowing from Mount Sant'Angelo to the Villa. The sculptural decoration around the courtyard, particularly the representation of [[quince]] trees, illustrates the 11th labor of [[Hercules]];  the theft of golden apples from the [[Garden of the Hesperides]], where they were guarded by the dragon Ladone.  Hercules was reputed to be a protector of the Tiiburtin region where the villa is located, and also was claimed as an ancestor of the d'Este family. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=23-24}}\n\n===The Apartments of the Cardinal===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa Deste Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 1.jpg|Detail of the wooden ceiling in the bed chamber of Ippolito d'Este\nFile:Vue depuis une fen\u00eatre de la Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Italie.jpg|The view from the apartments of the Cardinal\nFile:000910 tivoli v d este 10 cappella.jpg|The private chapel of the Cardinal\n</gallery>\nThe '''Salon''' on the ground floor is the first room of the personal apartments of Ippolito;  it was used for receptions, and features a spectacular view of the garden below and countryside beyond, including Villa of Hadrian.  The walls, bare today, were covered with leather decorated with gold and green designs and the eagles of the d'Este family. The vaulted ceiling of the room is still covered with a frieze and frescoes on the theme of virtue, painted in twenty different personifications.  These were designed by [[Livio Agresti]] in 1568, and created by a team of artists. and stucco-makers.  Other themes include landscapes with ruined temples, inspired by the Tiburtine countryside.\n\nA small '''antechamber''' next to the salon has a frieze and vault is decorated with more personifications of virtue, and leads to the '''Cardinal's Bedroom''', which was constructed in 1576. The bedroom walls were originally covered with leather painted with gold and silver.  The coffered wooden ceiling is the most notable feature of the room, gilded and painted with the Este crest. an eagle surrounded by quince branches, a bishop's hat and the motto of the Este family, ''ab insomnia non custodita dracone'',  a verse from [[Ovid]] referring to the dragon guarding the gardens of the Hesperides. Feminine figures representing different aspects of virtue occupy the corners of the room.  The private apartment is completed by a library and by a small chapel, whose walls are decorated with frescoes of mixture of classical and Christian symbolism, [[Sibyl]]s and of prophets, and whose ceiling vault features a fresco of the coronation of the Virgin Mary. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=28-32}}  The apartment also connects by doorways with Pirro Ligorio's classical [[Loggia|Gran Loggia]] on the garden facade of the house, based on the terrace below and designed in the form of a great triumphal arch.\n\n===The lower floor===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 5.jpg|Decoration of the First Tiburtine Hall\nFile:Villa Deste Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 10.jpg|Fresco in the Hall of Noah\nFile:Villa Deste Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 8.jpg|The Triumph of Apollo, in the Second Tiburtine Hall\nFile:000910 tivoli v d este 08 stanze.jpg|The Hall of Glory\nFile:010609 04 villadeste.JPG|The Hall of the Hunt\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Deckenfresko 2.jpg|Fresco of ''The Synod of the Gods'' on the ceiling of the Hall of the Fountain\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Deckenfresko 1.jpg|Fresco of Hercules welcomed to Olympus, on the ceiling of the Hall of Hercules\nImage:villa d'este at tivoli paintings arp.jpg|Ceiling fresco of the Second Tiburtine Hall, with scenes from mythology and Roman history\n</gallery>\nThe floor below the Cardinal's personal apartments contains a series of highly decorated rooms, each decorated with a specific theme, all connected to nature, mythology, and water.  The rooms are less formal than those of the apartment above; they were used for private moments in the life of the Cardinal; listening to music or poetry;  conversation, reading, and religious reflection.  They are reached by a large ceremonial stairway that descends from the courtyard, and are connected to each other by a long narrow corridor with a high vaulted ceiling, which receives light from a series of openings to the courtyard above. The ceiling of the corridor is decorated with mosaics from the late 16th century, representing a [[pergola]] inhabited by colorful birds, making the corridor seem a part of the garden. The corridor also features three elaborate rustic fountains, containing miniature grottos framed with columns and pediments.\n\nThe '''Hall of Noah''', like the other rooms on the floor, has walls covered with frescoes designed to resemble tapestries, intertwined with scenes of classical landscapes, ruins, rustic farm houses, and other scenes covering inch of the ceiling and walls,  This room is dated to 1571, at the end of the decoration of the villa, and is attributed to Girolamo Muziano, who was famous for similar scenes of Venetian landscapes. The major scenes portrayed are the Four Seasons, allegories of prudence and temperance, and the central scene of [[Noah]] with the ark shortly after its landing on [[Mount Ararat]], making an agreement with God.  A white eagle, the symbol of the d'Este, is prominently shown landing from the Ark.\n\nThe next room, the '''Hall of Moses,'''  features a fresco in the center of the ceiling showing Moses striking a rock with his rod and bringing forth water for the people of [[Israel]].  This was an allusion to the Cardinal, who had brought water to the Villa gardens by making channels through the rock.  Other panels show scenes from the life of Moses, a [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] with seven heads, the emblem of the family of Ercole I d'Este, an ancestor of Ippolito, and fantastic landscapes.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=36}}\n\nThe '''Hall of Venus''' originally had as its centerpiece a large fountain, with an artificial cliff and grotto framed in stucco.  The fountain a basin of water and a classical statue of a sleeping Venus, but in the 19th century the basin was removed and the Venus, which had been removed after the death of the Cardinal, was replaced by two new statues of Peace and Religion, representing a scene at the grotto of [[Lourdes]].  The original terra cotta floor is still in place, featuring the white eagle of the d'Este family. The only other decoration in the room is the 17th-century painting on the ceiling of angels offering flowers to Venus.\n\nThe First and Second '''Tiburtine Halls''' were created at the same time by a team of painters led by Cesare Nebia, they were made before 1569. and they both have a common plan;  The walls are covered with painted architectural elements, including columns and doors and elaborate painted moldings and sculptural elements, which give the rooms symeframe large number of frescoes. Floral designs fill the spaces between the painted architecture, along with medals, masks, and other insignia.  The decoration of the two rooms illustrates stories from mythology and the history of Tiburtine region, where the villa is located.\n\nThe main theme of the '''Second Tiburtine Hall''' is the story of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]]:  According to mythology, Queen Ida was punished by Jupiter for having raised young Bacchus To avoid the madness of her husband, Atamante, Venus and Neptune transformed her into a seer,  Leucotea.  She traveled to Italy where she lived in the TIburtine forests, giving prophecies, and predicting the birth of Christ. Another TIburtine legend illustrated in the room is that of King Annius, who chased Mercury, the kidnapper of his daughter Cloris, and was drowned in the river [[Aniene]], which takes his name, and which provides the water for the fountains of the Villa. The Sibyl, King Annius, and the personification of the Aniene River all appear in the frescoes of the room, along with the Triumph of Apollo.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=38}}\n\nThe '''First Tiburtine Hall''' illustrates the story of legendary three Greek brothers, [[Tiburtus]], Coras, and Catillus, who defeated the [[Sicels]], an [[Italic peoples|Italic]] tribe, and built a new city, [[Tibur]] (now [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]),  Their battle is illustrated in the central fresco of the ceiling, as are other events in the founding of the region. The decoration of the room also includes the Tenth Labor of Hercules, where he steals a valuable herd of cattle, and is rescued by Zeus, who showers his enemies with stones; as well as pairs of gods and goddesses in painted niches; Vulcan and Venus; Jupiter and Juno; Apollo with Diana; and Bacchus with Circe. On wall is an illustration of the oval fountain, which Ippolito was building at the time the room was decorated.\n\nThe '''Hall of the Fountain''' was used by Cardinal Ippolito as a reception room for guests who had just arrived through the garden below, and for concerts and other artistic events. The room was designed and made between 1565 and 1570, probably by Girolamo Muziano and his team of artists. The central element is a wall fountain, covered with multicolored ceramics and sculpture, encrusted with pieces of glass, seashells and precious stones,  and crowned by the white eagle of the d'Este family. The fountain was finished in 1568 by Paolo Calandrino. The basin of the fountain rests on two stone dolphins.  The reliefs in the central niche depict of the fountain the Tiburtine acropolis and Temple of the Sibyl. On the other walls are images of the house and unfinished garden and fountains, and a small illustration on the opposite wall from the fountain of Ippolito's villa in Rome, on the Quirinal Hill, now a residence of the Pope. The paintings on the ceiling are devoted scenes of mythology;  each corner has portraits of a different gods and goddesses - Tradition says that the painting of Mercury is a self-portrait of Muziano. The central fresco on the ceiling depicts the Synod of the Gods, with Jupiter in the center surrounded by all the gods of Olympus.  The fresco is modeled after a similar work by Raphael in the Loggia of Psyche in the [[Villa Farnesina]]. The hall connects with the loggia, and from there a stairway descends to the garden. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=41-43}}\n\nThe '''Hall of Hercules''' dates to 1565\u201366 and is also by Muziano. The paintings on the ceiling depict eight of the labors of Hercules, surrounded by depictions of landscapes, ancient architecture, and the graces and the virtues. The central painting of the ceiling shows Hercules being welcomed into Olympus by the gods.\n\nThe '''Hall of Nobility''' was the work of a different artist, [[Federico Zuccari]], and his team of painters.  The central fresco on the ceiling depicts \"Nobility on the throne between Liberality and Generosity\".  The decoration on the walls includes paintings of busts of [[Plato]], [[Pyhagoras|Pythagoras]], [[Diogenes]], [[Socrates]] and other classical philosophers, the Graces and Virtues, and [[Diana of Ephesus]], the goddess of Fertility, who also has a fountain dedicated to her in the garden.\n\nThe '''Hall of Glory''' was completed between 1566 and 1577 by Federico Zuccari and eight assistants. It is a masterpiece of Roman [[mannerist]] painting, with painted illusions of doors, windows, tapestries, sculptures, and of everyday objects used by the Cardinal. The central painting of the ceiling, the Allegory of Glory,  has been lost, but there are allegorical depictions of the virtues, the Four Seasons, and of Religion, Magnanimity, Fortune and Time.\n\nThe '''Hall of the Hunt''' is later than the other rooms, from the end of the 16th or beginning the 17th century, and is in a different style;  it features hunting scenes, rural landscapes,  hunting trophies, and, oddly, scenes of naval battles.  A stairway of [[travertine]] stone, called the \"snail stairway\", descends to the garden.  It was originally built to access a [[pallacorda]] Court, an ancestor of tennis, which Ippolito imported into Italy from the French Court.  The space where the court was located now houses the cafeteria and bookstore.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=48}}\n\nThe complete construction and furnishing of Ippolito's apartments was completed in 1572 when Ippolito was on his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.italia.it/en/travel-ideas/unesco-world-heritage-sites/villa-deste-a-triumph-of-the-baroque/brief-history-of-villa-deste.html|title=Brief History of Villa d'Este|date=2012-07-12|website=Italian Tourism Official Website|language=en|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Gardens and Fountains==\n{{Anchor|Description of the garden}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este 01.jpg|The Fountain of Neptune below the Fountain of the Organ\nFile:Fountain Rometta IMG 4167.jpg|The Rometta fountain\nFile:010609 28 villadesteacque.JPG|Neptune's fountain\nFile:Villa d'Este fountains 6.jpg|One hundred fountains\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Fontana dell'Ovato.jpg|The ''Fontana dell'Ovato'' (\"Oval Fountain\") cascades from its egg-shaped basin into a pool set against a rustic [[nymphaeum]].\nFile:Villa Deste park Civetta 2011 14.jpg|The Fountain of the Owl\nFile:Villa Deste park Nature 2011 23.jpg|The Fountain of Diana of Ephesus, or \"Mother Nature\"\n</gallery>\n\nThe fame and glory of the Villa d'Este was above all established by its extraordinary system of fountains;  fifty-one fountains and nymphaeums, 398 spouts, 364 water jets, 64 waterfalls, and 220 basins, fed by 875 meters of canals, channels and cascades, and all working entirely by the force of gravity, without pumps. \n \n[[Pirro Ligorio]], who was responsible for the iconographic programs worked out in the villa's frescos, was also commissioned to lay out the gardens for the villa, with the assistance of [[Tommaso Chiruchi]] of [[Bologna]], one of the most skilled [[hydraulic engineer]]s of the sixteenth century; Chiruchi had worked on the fountains at [[Villa Lante]].  At Villa d'Este he was assisted in the technical designs for the fountains by a Frenchman, [[Claude Venard]], who was a manufacturer of hydraulic [[Organ (music)|organ]]s. The result was one of the finest gardens of the Renaissance, rivaled only by the [[Villa Lante]], the [[Villa Farnese|Villa Farnese at Caprarola]] and the Villas [[Villa Aldobrandini|Aldobrandini]] and [[Villa Torlonia (Frascati)|Torlonia]] in [[Frascati]]. The garden and water features were admired and imitated over the next two centuries in gardens from Portugal to Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe garden plan is laid out on a central axis with subsidiary cross-axes, refreshed by some five hundred jets in fountains, pools and water troughs. The water is supplied by the [[Aniene]], which is partly diverted through the town, a distance of a kilometer, and, originally, by the Rivellese spring, which supplied a cistern under the villa's courtyard (now supplied by the Aniene too). The garden is now part of the [[Grandi Giardini Italiani]].\n\n===The Vialone, or Terrace===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli v d este 000910 03 vialone.jpg|The ''Vialone'', or terrace, at the top of the garden\nFile:Villa d'Este.JPG|The Fountain of the Tripod, with the view of the garden below\nImage:000910 tivoli v d este 47 facciata.jpg|The double loggia provided access to the ceremonial rooms, and a terrace for Cardinal's apartments above\nFile:105TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|The Cenacolo, or Gran Loggia, at the end of the Vialone\n</gallery>\nA large terrace, 200 meters long, called the '''Vialone''', lies between the Villa and the gardens, with a panoramic view of the gardens and countryside beyond. It was constructed between 1568 and 1569. The Cardinals used the space for fireworks, games, spectacles and festivities.  It originally was shaded by two rows of elm trees, except for the space directly in front of the Villa, left empty to preserve the view. The terrace is enclosed at one end by the Fountain of Europa, and at the other by an immense loggia and belvedere in the form of a triumphal arch called the '''Cenacolo'''.  This structure provided shade beneath in summer, as well as commanding viewpoints of the scenery.  It was originally intended to be decorated in the interior with stucco decoration, gilding and frescoes, but it was never finished.\n\nIn the center of the terrace, attached to the facade of the villa, is the double loggia, made in 1566\u20131577 of travertine stone. Its two stairways provide access to the ceremonial salons on the lower floor, while its upper level created a terrace for the Cardinal's apartments.  On the terrace level it contains a '''Nymphaeum''', or grotto,  where the '''Fountain of Leda''' is located. The original statuary of the fountain, depicting Jupiter and Leda transformed into a swan and four children,  Elena, Clytemnestra, Castor and Pollux. was sold in the 18th century and is now in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome. The statuary has been replaced by headless statue of [[Minerva]] found in the garden of the Palazzo Manni in Tivoli.  The original fountain featured a novel hydraulic trick;  water spouting from a vase held by Leda struck a metal disk, which caused flashes of light to reflect on the walls of the grotto. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=51}}\n\nThe '''Fountain of the Tripod''' is placed in the center of the Vialone.  It has only been there since 1930;  it is a copy of an ancient Roman fountain, a marble basin supported by a central column and three pilasters.  The original is now in the [[Louvre]].  The original fountain on the site, the Fountain of the Sea Horses, which was moved by Ippolito from Hadrian's Villa to his garden, is now in the [[Vatican Museum]]. \n \n'''The Fountain of Europa''' is found at the northeast end at the top of the garden.  It was begun by Ippolito but was not finished until 1671.  Its design, a triumphal arch with two orders of columns, corinthian and doric, copying that of the Grand Loggia.  The large niche in the center, now empty, held a sculpture ''Europa Embracing the Bull'' which is now in the VIlla Albani in Rome.\n\n=== The upper garden ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:000910 tivoli v d este 41 facciata.jpg|The Fountain of the Bicchierone, by [[Bernini]], and the Loggetta of the Cardinal\nFile:Villa d'Este Fountain of Bicchierone.jpg|The Fountain of the Bicchierone, seen from the Terrace\nFile:Villa d'Este fountain 5.jpg|Mask spouting water in the Grotto of Pomona\n File:Tivoli Villa dEste 18.jpg|The Fountain of Pegasus\n</gallery>\nTwo ramps lead down to the upper garden from Fountain of the Tripod, and there are symmetrical double flights of stairs at either end.  The '''Cardinal's Walk''' is a shaded path,  attached to the retaining wall of the terrace, which leads from one side of the garden to the other, passing by several grottos which are built into the retaining wall.  At the southeast end of the walk, just below the Fountain of Europa, is the '''Grotto of Igea and Aesculpius'''.  The grotto is decorated with tartar flakes, mosaics and colored fragments of sea shells, and a small portion of the original fresco.  It originally held two statues; that of Aesculpius, the god of medicine, now found in the [[Louvre]], and of [[Igea]], the daughter of Auesculpius, the goddess of healing (now in the Vatican Museum).\n\nThe '''Loggia of Pandora''' is found in the middle of the Cardinal's Walk, just below the center of the Villa.  This portion of the walk is covered, with arcades looking out at the garden. It contained a nymphaeum built into the wall, and originally was decorated with mosaics and with a statue of [[Pandora]] and two statues of [[Minerva]].  The statue of Pandora carried a vase of water, symbolizing the evils of the world. The vase was a concealed fountain, pouring out water. The statues were sold in the 18th century;  Pandora and one of the Minervas are now in the [[Capitoline Museum]].  In the 19th century the nymphaeum was converted into a Christian chapel;  it was a favorite place of the composer Franz Liszt, who dedicated two pieces of music to the chapel. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=54}}\n\nThe '''Fountain of the Bicchierone''' is one of two fountains created for the Villa by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  It was made between 1660 and 1661 on a commission from Cardinal Rinaldo I d'Este. The basin of the fountain is in the form of a large shell, which reaches up to the level of the terrace. In the center is a toothed ''Bicchierone'' (cup or chalice) from which the water sprays upwards.  Bernini supervised the building of the fountain, and, following its inauguration in May 1661, he had the height of the spouting water reduced, to avoid blocking the view from the Loggia of Pandora.  Though not part of the original design of the garden, the fountain became a link between the architecture of the palace and the garden. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=56}}\n\nThe '''Loggetta of the Cardinal''' is a small [[Baluster|balustraded]] terrace surrounded by high laurel hedges and stone benches,  between the Fountain of the Biccherone and the garden.  This was said to be the Cardinal's favorite spot for reading and discussing poetry and art, and watching the construction of the garden around him.  Shortly after his death, a large statue of Hercules, with the boy Achilles in his arms, was placed there, overlooking the garden below. It was one of three statues of Hercules in central positions along the central axis.  When seen from the bottom the garden, they were all visible, aligned with the Loggia of the Villa at the top. The statue is now found in the [[Louvre]].\n\nThe '''Grotto of Diana''' is located at the end of the Cardinal's Walk, below the '''Gran Loggia'''.  It is a large underground vaulted chamber, decorated in 1570-72 by Paolo Caladrino, and completely covered with mosaics of mythological scenes, with images of fish, dragons, dolphins, pelicans and other animals, as well as the eagles and apples of the d'Este family. Its central feature was a rustic fountain with statue of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], in a large niche decorated with stuccol reliefs of landscapes, the sea and a ship.  All of the statues were sold in the 18th century and are now in the [[Capitoline Museum]] in Rome. Some of the original [[majolica]] floor tiles from the 16th century can still be seen.\n\nBelow the Loggetta of the Cardinal is a walkway which traverses the garde\n\npasses by three grottos. In the center is the '''Grotto of Hercules''',  which is covered by the Loggetta of the Cardinal. Beneath this grotto was a cistern and some of the hydraulic machinery for the fountains below. The grotto once had stucco reliefs of either animals or the labors of Hercules. The statue of Hercules in repose formerly in the grotto is now in the Vatican Museum. The '''Grotto of Pomona''' is similar in design to the Grotto of Hercules.  Some of the original mosaic decoration is still visible.  The water poured into a fountain from a white marble mask, which was found when the fountain was restored in 2002.\n\n===The Oval Fountain (''Fontana dell'Ovato'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli Villa dEste 26.jpg|The Oval Fountain\nFile:Ovato.TIF|The oval fountain, seen from the terrace\nFile:Big fountain in Tivoli (3396134588).jpg|The statue of the Sibyl Albunensa over the fountain, and the artificial mountains behind it.\n</gallery>\nThe '''Oval Fountain''' was one of the first fountains in the garden, and among the most famous.  It was designed by [[Pirro Ligorio]], the architect of the villa, as a water theater, spraying water in variety of forms.  It was begun in 1565 and finished in 1570. It was made by fountain engineers Tomasso de Como and Curzio Maccarono, with sculpture by Raffaello Sangallo. A massive stone basin against the semicircular back wall cascades water into the fountain, and sprays it into the air, while water jets into the basin from vases in the hands of statues of [[Nereids]], and also sprays in fan shapes from vases in niches in the semi-circular wall behind the fountain.  An artificial mountain rises above the fountain, symbolizing the Tiburtine landscape;  the mountain is pierced by three grottos, each pouring forth water, and is decorated with statues representing the Sibyl Albunesa with her son Melicerte, by Gillis van den Vliete (1568), and statues representing rivers Erculaneo and Anio, by Giovanni Malanca (1566), all of which pour water into the Oval Fountain.  An upper walkway above the fountain leads past the ring of basins and cascades. The fountain also has its own grotto, the '''Grotto of Venus''', designed by Pirro Ligorio, and built in 1565\u201368.  It served as a meeting place for guests on hot summer days. The original statues of the grotto; a figure of Venus similar to the Capitoline Venus and two ''putti'' are no longer there, but traces of the monochrome murals of grotesque figures, tiles and sculpted grotto walls still remain. {{sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=57-58}}\n\n===The Hundred Fountains (''Cento Fontane'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:066TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|The Hundred Fountains\nFile:IT-Tivoli-villa-este-wasserspeier.jpg|A mask of the Hundred Fountains\nFile:064TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|Detail of the Hundred Fountains\nFile:Fontaines de lall\u00e9e aux Cent-Fontaines (Tivoli) (5868497891).jpg|A d'Este eagle among the spouts in the Hundred Fountains\n</gallery>\nThe Hundred Fountains were another celebrated marvel of the gardens in the Renaissance. They are located between the oval fountain and the Fontana di Rometta, and there are actually nearly three hundred spouts fed by three parallel canals, one above the other. Along the edge of the upper canal there are spouts in the form of lilies, the emblem of France, alternating with the d'Este eagle, boats and obelisks; all spraying water in a fan shape. The water is captured by the second canal, which feeds it into spouts in the form of masks, from which it reaches the lower canal.\n\nThe fountains were constructed between 1566 and 1577. The original alley of fountains had more decoration, including small boats alternating with terra cotta vases along the upper canal, planted with fruit trees;  and the wall was decorated with sculptural plaques showing scenes from the ''Metamorphosis'' of [[Ovid]]. These deteriorated quickly and were largely removed or replaced. The wall is now so overgrown with vegetation that little of remaining decoration can be seen. It was restored in the 17th century, then abandoned for a long period, and finally restored again in 1930 to its present form.  Like every other feature of the garden, canals and the hundred fountains had their part in the symbolic plan; they represented the aqueducts the Romans built to supply water to Rome.  The Hundred Fountains have been celebrated in Italian art and literature, particularly in the ''Roman Elegies'' of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=62-63}}\n\nTo descend to the next level, there are stairs at either end \u2013 the elaborate fountain complex called the ''Rometta'' (\"the little Rome\") is at the far left \u2013 to view the full length of the ''Hundred Fountains'' on the next level, where the water jets fill the long rustic trough, and Pirro Ligorio's ''Fontana dell'Ovato'' ends the cross-vista. A visitor may walk behind the water through the [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] arcade of the concave [[nymphaeum]], which is peopled by marble nymphas by [[Giambattista della Porta]]. Above the nymphaeum, the sculpture of ''[[Pegasus]]'' recalls to the visitor the fountain of [[Hippocrene]] on [[Parnassus]], haunt of the [[Muse]]s.\n\nThis terrace is united to the next by the central Fountain of the Dragons, dominating the central perspective of the gardens, erected for a visit in 1572 of [[Pope Gregory XIII]] whose coat-of-arms features a dragon. The sound of this fountain was in contrast to a nearby ''Uccellario'' with artificial birds.<ref>It was said by the traveler Raymond, that theses fountains \"vomit forth the water with a most horrid noise\" [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_yRBliCBdNNAC An Itinerary: Contayning a Voyage, Made Through Italy, in the Yeare 1646]; by John Raymond, p. 171.</ref> Central stairs lead down a wooded slope to three rectangular fishponds set on the cross-axis at the lowest point of the gardens, terminated at the right by the water organ (now brought back into use) and Fountain of Neptune (belonging to the 20th century restorations).\n\n===The Fountain of Rometta ({{lang|it|Fontana di Rometta}})===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:052TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|The Rometta fountain, a miniature of ancient Rome\nFile:Detail from the Villa d'Este, 2015-05-19-5.jpg|The boat with an obelisk mast, symbolizing the Tiburtina island in the Tiber, below the statue of Rome Triumphant\nFile:La Rometta (Tivoli) (5868497139).jpg|Statues symbolizing the Aniene River (left) and Apennine mountains (right)\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of Rometta is located at the opposite end of the Hundred Fountains from the Oval Fountain. It is an important piece of the symbolic story told by the upper gardens;  the waters of the Tiber River emerge in the Tiburtin Mountains, symbolized by the Oval Fountain, run through the valley (The Hundred Fountains) and arrive at the gates of Rome;  the Rometta Fountain is Ancient Rome in miniature;  the real city was visible in the distance behind the Fountain. The fountain was designed by Pirro Ligorio and built by Curzio Maccarone between 1567 and 1570.  The fountain and its architecture are built on a wide semicircular Terrace supported by pilasters connected with a double arcades.  The back portion of the fountain represents the buildings the monuments if Rome; deteriorated greatly in the early 19th century, and a large part was demolished in 1850, but a portion of this architecture still stands on the left side of the fountain. The small buildings were divided into seven sections, representing the seven hills of Rome and their most famous monuments. The little city included gates and arches, and even small marble statues.  In the center of the miniature city is a large statue of ''Rome Victorious,''  made in 1568 by the Fliemish sculptor Pierre de la Motte, facing the statue of the Tiburtine Sibyl at the other end of the row of Hundred Fountains. Another statue by the same artist, ''The She Wolf nurses her Twins'', was placed in the garden in 1611.  The water flowing through fountain basin next to the city represents the Tiber River; the boat in the fountain, with a mast in the form an obelisk, symbolizes the Tiburtina Island.\n\nA new feature was added to the Fountain of Rometta in the early 17th century; an artificial mountain, pierced by grottos and caves, to left of the city buildings. On the top of the artificial mountain is a statue of the river god Aniene, holding in his hand a miniature of the Temple of the Sibyl. A statue of a figure representing the Apennine mountains, holding a mountain in his arms. is half-hidden in a grotto. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=87-89}}\n\n===The Fountain of the Dragons (''Fontana dei Draghi'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli Villa dEste 29.jpg|The jet of the Fountain of the Dragons, viewed from below\nFile:Fontana del Drago 03.TIF|The four dragons\nFile:Fontana del Drago 05.TIF|A dolphin in the fountain of the dragons\nFile:010609 20 villadestedrago.JPG|The fountain of the dragons from above\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of the Dragons was designed by PIrro Ligorio to illustrate the story of Hercules fulfilling one of his labors by stealing the golden apples of the [[Garden of the Hesperides]], which were guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].  The same story is illustrated in frescoes in the interior decoration of the Villa.\n\nThe fountain is located on the central vertical axis of the gardens, aligned with the Villa, and in the center of the original garden. just below the Hundred Fountains.  It is enclosed by two semi-circular ramps which lead to the level above.  The walls of the ramps around it are covered with pebbly tartar and ornamented with bands of mosaic and majolica tile, and contain two large niches. Ligorio planned this fountain to illustrate the theme of war and combat against evil; he intended that one niche would be occupied by a statue of Hercules with his club, before he killed the dragon Ladon; and the second with statues of Mars, the god of War, [[Perseus]], and gladiators. In the center of the fountain is a small ''scogliera'' or island, which holds four sculpted dragons, which jet water from their mouths into the fountain, while a powerful central fountain shoots a column of water vertically high in the air, visible from all around the garden This idea of a vertical jet of water as the centerpiece of the garden was copied in many baroque gardens in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In addition to the dragons, two sculpted dolphins spray water across the pool. More water flows down from above, running in channels attached to the parapets of the ramps. The water emerges from the breasts of two [[sphinxes]]- half-women, half sea horses;  flows down a channel, enters the mouth of a sculpted frog, and emerges again through the mouth of a carved [[salamander]]. In keeping with the theme of combat against evil, in Ippolito's time the fountains also produced dramatic sound effects heard throughout the garden;  water kept under pressure was suddenly released, imitating the sound of fireworks or cannons firing.  To make more noise, the flow of water from above could also be from a fine spray to a heavy downpour.\n\nIppolito had the fountain altered for the visit of Pope Gregory in 1572.  The dragon with one hundred heads was replaced by four dragons, the family emblem of the Pope.  Ippolito died three months later, and the fountain was still not completed.  It was not finished until late in the 17th century with a different sculptural program;  Instead of a statue of Hercules, a statue of the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] holding lightning bolts in his hands was placed in the central niche. The cannon-like sound effects from the fountain now were meant to be the sound of his thunderbolts.\n.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=89}}\n\n===The Fountain of the Owl  (''Fontana della Civetta'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Civetta 03.TIF|Mosaic decoration on the columns depicting the Golden Apples of the Hesperides\nFile:Detail from the Villa d'Este, 2015-05-19-8.jpg|Courtyard of the Fountain of the Owl\nFile:Tivoli Villa dEste 24.jpg|The Fountain of the Owl. Some of the original sculptural figures are replaced by cutouts.\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of the Owl is located in the Southwest part of the garden, below the Fountain of Rometta and the Fountain of Proserpina, These three fountains form a single unit of architecture, their terraces connected by stairways,  with nymphaeums placed beneath the terraces. The Fountain of the Owl was built between 1565 and 1569 by Giovanni del Duca.  Compared with other fountains in the garden, it is very formal,  placed on a terrace surrounded by walls with niches, crowned with the white eagles and lily symbols of the d'Este. The fountain itself is a separate structure, entirely covered with polychrome tiles.  At the top, above the niche, is the coat of arms of the d'Este, held by two angels.  The niche is flanked by ionic columns.  Originally it contained the statues of two youths holding a goatskin which poured water into a basin held by three satyrs. The sculpture in the niche,  believed lost, was rediscovered during a renovation in 2001\u201302, hidden under mineral deposits and earth. The architectural elements were intact, but the figures of the youths and satyrs were missing or destroyed.\n\nThis fountain also produced music, thanks to an ingenious automaton made by the French fountain engineer Luc Leclerc, installed in 1566, before the Fountain of the Organ on the other side of the garden.  It featured twenty painted bronze birds placed in the niche, posed on two metal olive branches.  Each bird sang an individual song, produced by piped water and air. A mechanical owl appeared, and the birds stopped singing;  then, at the end of the performance,  all the birds sang together.  This musical feature was admired and copied in other European gardens, and functioned until the end of the 17th century.  It needed constant repair due to the action of the water on its delicate mechanism, and by the 19th century were completely ruined.  The decorative elements of the fountain were completely restored in the 1930s, and restored again in 2001\u20132002, {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=82-85}}\n\nDuring the restoration work of 2001\u201302, the workers found some of the original mechanism that produced the bird songs, including the wind chamber, the tubes that moved the air and water, and the machinery that made the owl move.  Using modern materials, Leonardo Lombardi was able to make a new version of the old machinery so the birds can sing and move again.\n\n===The Fountain of the Proserpina (''Fontana di Proserpina'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este din Tivoli - Fontana di Proserpina1.jpg|Stairway from the Fountain of the Owl up to the Fountain of Proserpina, with Rometta Fountain visible above\nFile:Villa Deste park Proserpina 2011 17.jpg|The Fountain of Proserpina\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of Proserpina is located just above the Fountain of the Owl and connects with it by a stairway. It was sometimes called the Fountain of the Emperors, because it was originally intended to display statues of four Roman Emperors who had villas in the region: [[Julius Caesar]], [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]].  It was designed and built by Alberto Galvani in 1569\u201370.  It was connected with the Rometta Fountain above by two stairways (only one remains today) whose parapets support channels of water pouring through shells and masks.  The stairways close two sides of the small fountain courtyard.  The fountain is placed in a triumphal arch between the stairways.  The arch is framed by twisting columns, similar to those in Saint Peter's basilica in Rome. The central niche held a statue of the goddess of fertility [[Proserpina]] being kidnapped by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], placed there in about 1640.  The statue of Proserpina has disappeared;  Pluto remains, carried on a shell supported by two sea horses. Niches on the sides hold statues of [[triton (mythology)|Tritons]] riding dolphins and blowing on their ''buccina'', or seashell trumpets.\n\n===The Fountain of the Organ (''Fontana dell\u2019Organo'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Fontana dell'Organo 07.TIF|Detail of the Fountain of the Organ\nFile:Fontana dellOrgano (Tivoli) (5868495711).jpg|The Fountain of the Organ, with its ''Castellum aqua'', or water castle, behind it.\nFile:Fontana dell'Organo 01.JPG|The kiosk containing the keyboard of the water organ\nFile:Fontana dell'Organo 03.TIF|Statue of Apollo on the facade of the Water Castle.\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of the Organ (\u2018\u2019Fontana dell\u2019Organo\u2019\u2019) is one of the most famous features of the garden; it was described and imitated throughout Europe. Work on the masonry structure began in 1566.  The fountain itself was made by the French fountain engineer Luc Leclerc and his nephew Claude Venard.  After the death of Leclerc Venard invented the ingenious mechanism of the water organ, which was installed in 1571.\n\nThe fountain was the first of its kind, and astonished everyone who heard it;  when Pope Gregory XIII visited the villa in 1572, accompanied by his court of cardinals and princes, he insisted on inspecting the interior of the fountain, to learn if someone wasn\u2019t concealed inside making the music.\n\nA massive masonry arch behind the fountain, the \u2018\u2019castellum aquae\u2019\u2019 or water castle,  conceals the water reservoir and the hydraulic machinery of the fountain. The original design featured a grotto in the niche of the arch, with a view of the twenty-two pipes of the organ. A statue of \u2018\u2019Mother Nature\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2019Ephesian Diana\u2019\u2019 was placed in front of the arch in 1569;  it now has its own fountain in the lower garden.\n\nThe water creating the music arrived first at the top of the \u2018\u2019Castellum aquae\u2019.  It went first through a series of whirlpools, which mixed air with the water; then it dropped down a pipe into the \u2018\u2019camera aeolia\u2019\u2019, or wind chamber, where the air and water were separated;  the water turned a wheel, rotating a cylinder which opened the valves of the twenty-two pipes, so the air could pass through the pipes and make the music.\n\nThe original performances of the fountain began with the sound of two trumpets, held by the statue of Fame on the cornice of the fountain. Then came the music, likely [[madrigals]] played by four or five pipes;  then the climax:  \u201cThe Flood\u201d, a cascade of water from the top of the fountain, and jets of water shooting up from the fountain below.  This was accompanied by the sound of a horn held by a \u2018\u2019Triton\u2019\u2019 in the fountain;  the horn blew softly, then loudly, then softly again.\n\nThe mechanism of the fountain was extremely delicate and required continual cleaning and maintenance.  The fountain was restored in the early 18th century by Cardinal Alessandro d\u2019Este, who added the white d\u2019Este eagle to the top of the \u2018\u2019castellum aquae\u2019\u2019,  and ornamented the facade with statues of [[Orpheus]] and [[Apollo]]; [[Caryatids]] and Winged Victories;  and bas-reliefs of Orpheus entrancing the animals and a musical contest between Apollo and Marsia.  The organ itself was entirely redone.  It was given a keyboard with a wider range of notes and was housed in an octagonal kiosk with a cupola. The organ was restored several more times in the 17th century, but by the end of the 18th century, it had deteriorated beyond hope of repair.\n\nIn 2003,  after a long and delicate restoration, the organ was able to play again. The original wind chamber and tank for creating whirlpools were retained, and the rest of the mechanism was replaced with new machinery in modern materials following the original principles. It now has 144 pipes, and is controlled by a cylinder, operated by the water, which can play four pieces of late Renaissance music for a total of four minutes.\n\n===The Fountain of Neptune (''Fontana di Nettuno'') and the Fish ponds (''Peschiere'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Querachse mit Neptunbrunnen und Wasserorgel 1.jpg|The Fountain of Neptune across the fish ponds\nFile:Fontana di Nettuno (Tivoli) (5868499091).jpg|The fountain of Neptune\nFile:Peschiera by M.Hermoso.TIF|Border of the fish ponds\nFile:Villa d'Este fountain and pools.jpg|The fish ponds seen from the Fountain of the Organ\n</gallery>\n\nDirectly below the Fountain of the Organ, and receiving the water from the upper fountain, is the Fountain of Neptune, a work created in the 20th century to replace a garden landmark which had deteriorated.\n\nThe space was originally occupied by a rocky cascade, created in the 17th century by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  It was commissioned by Cardinal Rinado I d\u2019Este as a background for the lateral axis of the garden, unfinished by Cardinal Ippolito.  Bernini's plan called for a waterfall from the Fountain of the Organ which leaped over the grottoes of the Sibyls, then cascaded down a rocky slope to a lake decorated with reefs and statues.  Two additional cascades entered the lake from the sides.  Bernini designed the cascade to produce a thunderous sound of falling water.  Bernini's cascade was reproduced in paintings and engravings, and was imitated in other gardens in Italy and as far away as England.  Unfortunately, the cascade was entirely neglected for two centuries, dry, crumbling and overgrown with vegetation.  In the 1930s the architect Attilio Rossi created the present fountain, using what remained of Bernini's cascade.  Against the wall of the Grottoes of the Sibyls, he built rectangular pools with powerful water jets, the tallest jets in the center.  The centerpiece was a grotto beneath the waterfall from the Fountain of the Organ; the grotto contained a 16th-century torso of a statue of Neptune, which had originally been intended for an unfinished fountain of the seas. Other jets of water in fan shapes rise from pools on the sides of the fountain.\n\nThe three fish ponds (''Peschiere'') cross the garden from the Fountain of Neptune.  They served originally to provide fresh fish, duck, and swan for the table of the Cardinal, and also, in the plan of Pirro Ligorio,  were intended to connect two fountains;  the Fountain of the Organ and the cascade and the Fountain of the Seas. In the center of the ponds, Ligorio had originally planned to create a central pond with monumental fountains.  However, when Ippolito died in 1572 only two of the ponds had been completed. In the late 16th century the ponds were lined by sixteen tall pilasters in the form of ''ermes'' which jetted out fan-shaped sprays of water, creating a multitude of rainbows on a sunny day.\n\nIn 1632 the Duke of Modena, in charge of the Villa, entirely remodeled the ponds.  The pilasters were removed and replaced with eight pedestals with vases which spouted water, and with twenty-four large pots containing a variety of citrus trees. The ponds now serve primarily as a picturesque foreground for cascades and fountains of the Fountain of Neptune.\n\n==The Lower Garden - The Rotonda of the Cypresses and the Fountain of Diana of Ephesus==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa Deste park Nature 2011 23.jpg|The Fountain of Diana of Ephesus\nFile:Villa d'Este din Tivoli - Fontane delle Mette.jpg|The Mette fountains in the lower garden\nFile:Aquile estensi 01.TIF|Fountain of the d'Este eagles\n</gallery>\n\nIn the 16th century the lower garden, below the fishponds,  was originally largely a kitchen garden. The center of the lower garden was divided into sixteen large squares, with a pergola in the center of each section, surrounded by beds of medicinal herbs and flowers, and large pots of fruit trees.  The main paths dividing the garden were covered with trellises on which grew grapes, heather and [[jasmine]]. In the center was a large wooden pavilion, which contained four small fountains in the form of flowers, jetting water.  The pergolas and pavilion were demolished in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and replaced by the '''Rotonda of the Cypresses''', a circular alley which originally contained sixteen cypress trees, and offered shade to visitors arriving in the gardens, as well as a dramatic view of the rest of the garden, the fountains and the Villa high above.  By the 19th century the cypress trees were huge, and were among the most famous features of gardens, painted by artists and inspiring music by [[Franz Liszt]] and poetry by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]].  Two of the original cypress trees are still there; the other cypresses and laurel hedges were planted at the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe '''Fountains of the d'Este eagle''' are a group of small rustic fountains, with water spurting up from stone bowls, with a variety of themes.  One contains a group of statues of the white eagle, the emblem of the d'Este family.  These fountains are a vestige the formal gardens that occupied that part of the garden before the Rotonda of Cypresses was built.\n\nThe lower garden also contains two large rustic fountains, called the '''Mete''', located on the northwest corner of the garden near the entrance. They were designed to look like natural rock, with grottos and niches.  Created in 1568\u201369, they were made by Tommaso da Como, and were originally intended to feature two large statues of giants, the guardians of the garden.  A smaller rustic fountain, called the '''Fontana Rustca dell'Inverno''', holds a 16th-century statue of Winter that originally was in the Gran Loggia.\n\nThe most famous fountain in the lower garden is the '''Fountain of Diana of Ephesus''', also known as the Fountain of Mother Nature. This statue originally stood next to the Fountain of the Organ;  it was moved to the lower garden by Alessandro d'Este in the 16th century.  It was made by the Flemish sculptor Gillis van den Vliete in 1568, and modeled after a classical Roman statue of [[Diana of Ephesus]] from the second century, now in the National Museum of Naples.  It stands in a grotto made of tartar flakes;  jets of water spurt from the multiple breasts of the goddess.\n\n==The Villa d'Este in Art==\nFew gardens have been painted or drawn by as many notable artists than the Villa d'Este, particularly during the Renaissance and in the 19th century. As a result, features of the garden influenced and were imitated in other gardens across Europe, from England to Russia. In the Renaissance, the garden was seen as a showcase of classical art and new technology, but by the end of the 18th century, when the garden was overgrown and crumbling, it helped created the image of the picturesque romantic garden. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Piranesi-16049.jpg|The Villa d'Este gardens by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] (1761)\nFile:Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard - Cypress Avenue at the Villa d`Este in Tivoli, 1774 - Google Art Project.jpg|Cypress Avenue at Villa d'Este by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]] (1774)\nFile:Hubert Robert - The Oval Fountain in the Gardens of the Villa d'Este, Tivoli - Google Art Project.jpg|Drawing of the Oval Fountain by [[Hubert Robert]] (1733\u20131808)\nFile:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Villa d'Este - Google Art Project.jpg|The Villa d'Este by [[J.M.W.

It is now an Italian state museum, and is listed as a [[World Heritage Sites|UNESCO world heritage site]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ippolito II d'Este.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, creator of the Villa d'Este and its gardens]]\nThe Villa was commissioned by Cardinal [[Ippolito II d'Este]] (1509\u20131572), second son of [[Alfonso I d'Este]], the Duke of Ferrara and grandson of [[Pope Alexander VI]], along with [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. The Este family had been lords of Ferrara since 1393, and were famous as patrons of the arts and of the humanist scholars of the [[Renaissance]]. As a second son, Ippolito was destined for a career in the church; he was named archbishop of Milan when he was only ten years old. At the age of 27, he was sent to the French court, where he became an advisor to the French King, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], and in 1540 became a member of the King's Private Council. At the age of thirty, at the request of the King, [[Pope Paul III]] made d'Este a cardinal. Thanks to his ecclesiastical and royal connections, he became one of the wealthiest cardinals of the time, with an annual income estimated at 120,000 ''scudi''. He was a lavish patron of the arts, supporting among others the sculptor [[Benvenuto Cellini]], the musician [[Pierluigi da Palestrina]] and the poet [[Torquato Tasso]].  While his income was enormous, he was always in debt. The new French King, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], sent him as an envoy to Rome, where he played a major role in the social and political life of the city. He appeared destined to become Pope and used all of his money and influence toward that goal, but at the time of the [[Reformation]] and the [[Council of Trent]], his extravagant style of life worked against him.\nHis first candidacy for the papal position, in 1549, with the support of the French King, was blocked by the Habsburg Emperor. D'Este promptly withdrew his own candidacy, endorsed the Habsburg candidate, and was rewarded by the College of Cardinals on December 3, 1549 with the lifetime position of Governor of Tivoli. This new title suited d'Este, because he was already a passionate collector of antiquities, and it gave him jurisdiction over the site of Hadrian's villa and other sites just being excavated. He did not give up his ambition to become Pope. He was five times a candidate for Pope, but was never selected.{{Sfn|Barisi|page=8}}\n[[File:Pirro Ligorio 1.gif|thumb|left|200px|[[Pirro Ligorio]], the artist and classical scholar who planned the themes and symbolism of the Villa and gardens]]\nTivoli had been a popular summer residence since ancient Roman times due to its altitude, cooler temperatures and its proximity to the [[Villa Hadriana]], the summer residence of the Emperor [[Hadrian|Hadrian I]]. The position of Governor of Tivoli came with an official residence located in a former convent of the [[Benedictine]] order, which had been built in the 9th century on the site of an old Roman villa. In 1256 it had been donated to the Franciscan order. The residence was not large enough for the enormous household of a Cardinal as prominent as d'Este, but it did have a spectacular view of the countryside below, including Hadrian's villa, and an abundant natural water supply for fountains and gardens. D'Este commissioned a prominent classical scholar, [[Pirro Ligorio]], who had studied the Villa Hadriana and other Roman sites the vicinity, to plan a new villa and garden which would exceed anything the Romans had built. He obtained an abundant supply of marble and statuary from the ruins of Hadrian's villa. {{Sfn|Barisi|pages=8-9}}\n\n[[File:Dup\u00e9rac, \u00c9tienne - Gardens at Villa d'Este - 1560-1575.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Villa and gardens in 1560\u20131575]]\n\nThe land was acquired and construction was planned to begin at the end of 1550, but the Cardinal was distracted by various diplomatic missions; he was posted to northern Italy to resolve a war in Parma, then sent by Henry II on a mission to Sienna. He did not return to Tivoli until the summer of 1555. In September 1555, however, he was accused of [[simony]] by Pope [[Paul IV]] and exiled. The Pope died in 1559, and the new pontiff, [[Pope Pius IV]], rehabilitated d'Este and restored his title as governor of Tivoli. Construction began when he returned in July 1560. More land was needed and acquired through 1569. The vast construction site required the demolition of houses, public buildings and roads. In 1568 the local residents filed twelve different lawsuits against the Cardinal, but did not deter him from his project. Between 1563 and 1565, a huge amount of earth was excavated and used to construct new terraces; arcades, grottos, niches, and nymphaeums were constructed. The nearby river Aniene was diverted to furnish water for the complex system of pools, water jets, channels, fountains, cascades and [[jeux d'eau|water games]]. The steep slope of the garden; more than {{convert|45|m}} from top to bottom, posed special challenges. Canals were dug and {{convert|200|m}} of underground pipes were laid to carry the water from the artificial mountain under the oval fountain to the rest of the garden. Following the aesthetic principles of the Renaissance, the garden was carefully divided into regular units, or compartments, each {{convert|30|m}} across, laid out along a longitudinal median axis, with five lateral axes.  {{Sfn|Barisi|pages=10-11}}\n\nThe plans for the villa itself were carried out under the direction of the Ferrarese architect-engineer [[Alberto Galvani]], court architect of the [[House of Este|Este]]. The chief painter of the ambitious internal decoration was [[Livio Agresti]] from [[Forl\u00ec]]. In 1565 and 1566, work began on the decoration of the interior of the villa.  The decoration was carried out by a team of painters under Girolamo Muziano and [[Federico Zuccari]]. In 1566, the Cardinal made his fifth effort to be elected Pope, but once again he was defeated, and he was excluded by the new pontiff, [[Pope Pius V]], from any more official appointments. He turned more and more of his attention to the decoration of his villa. New teams of painters and stucco workers labored on the task between 1567 and 1572, under the direction of Girolamo Muziano, Livio Agresti, Cesare Nebbia, Durante Alberti, Metteo Neroni, and [[Federico Zuccari]].{{Sfn|Barisi|page=12}} The painters were joined by sculptors Giovan Battista della Porta. Pirrino del Galgliardo, Gillis van den Vliete, Giovanni Malanca, and Pierre de la Motte.  They were joined by ceramists and mosaic artists, as well as fountain engineers, led by Pirro Ligorio, the original designer of the project, who returned to finish the work in 1567\u201368.\n\nThe frantic work on the project began to slow in 1569, probably due to the financial difficulties of the Cardinal, who had no more hope of being elected Pope and had lost his lucrative French positions. He spent more and more of his time in the villa, reading and meeting with the leading poets, artists and philosophers of the Renaissance. In the summer of 1572, he entertained one last important guest, [[Pope Gregory XIII]]. To prepare for the visit, the Cardinal redecorated the top floors of the villa and rushed completion of the dragon fountain. The reception for the Pope cost him more than five thousand ''scudi'' forcing him to pawn his silver and other precious objects. Soon after the reception, on December 2, 1572, the Cardinal died in Rome, and was buried in a simple tomb in the church adjoining the Villa.{{Sfn|Barisi|page=13}}\n\n===The Villa in later years===\n[[Image:Carl Blechen 007.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Park of the Villa d'Este'', [[Carl Blechen]], 1830. The overgrown garden appealed to the [[Romanticism|Romantic imagination]]; today this same view is once again manicured.]]\nWith the death of Ippolito in 1572, the villa and gardens passed to his nephew, Cardinal Luigi (1538\u20131586), who continued work on some of the unfinished fountains and gardens, but struggled with high maintenance costs. After his death in 1586, it was owned by the Cardinal Deacons of the Sacred College, who did little to maintain villa. In 1599 it returned to the Este family with the nomination of Cardinal Alessandro d'Este (1538\u20131624). Alessandro had the energy and ambition of his ancestor and carried out a major renovation of the gardens and water systems, as well as building a new system of fountains in the lower garden. He also persuaded Pope Gregory XV to formally grant ownership of the villa to the Este family. His successors, the Dukes of Modena, made further additions to the gardens. Francesco I (1629-1641) restored many of the crumbling structures and began planting trees in the previously unshaded gardens. Cardinal Rinaldo I commissioned two new fountains by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1660\u201361. However, after 1695, the Este family was unable to support the high cost of maintaining the villa, which they rarely used and which produced no income. The villa went into a long decline. After 1751, the furnishings were sent to Modena, and the antique sculpture was gradually removed from the gardens and sold to collectors. In 1796, the [[House of Habsburg]] took possession of the villa, after [[Ercole III d'Este, Duke of Modena|Ercole III d'Este]] bequeathed it to his daughter [[Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este|Maria Beatrice]], married to [[Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este|Grand Duke Ferdinand of Habsburg]]. It was largely neglected and was twice occupied by French soldiers, who took away much of the decoration that remained.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1896, the villa was owned by Cardinal Gustav von Hohenlohe, who restored the dilapidated villa and the ruined and overgrown gardens, which now appealed to the romantic sentiments of the period. The villa once again attracted artists, musicians and writers. The composer [[Franz Liszt]] made several visits between 1865 and 1885, and wrote three pieces of piano music, two musical \"[[Threnody|threnodies]]\" with the title \"Aux cypr\u00e8s de la Villa d\u2019Este\" and the [[character piece]] \"Les jeux d'eau \u00e0 la Villa d'Este,\" that depict the grounds.  They were placed in the \"third year\" of his [[Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage]].  The latter includes some of the most influential evocations of the play of water ever written for piano.\n\nAfter the First World War, the villa was acquired by the Italian State, which began a major restoration in 1922. The villa was refurnished with paintings from the storerooms of the Galleria Nazionale, Rome. It suffered bomb damage in 1944 during World War II, and many of the walls were degraded in postwar years by environmental pollution, but campaigns of restoration and protection have managed to preserve intact the famous features of the villa and gardens. [[Jean Garrigue]]'s volume of poems ''A Water Walk by Villa d'Este'' (1959) was inspired by the gardens. [[Kenneth Anger]] filmed ''[[Eaux d'Artifice]]'' among the water features of the garden.  The famous [[water organ]], which had not functioned for many years, was restored and now plays again each day for visitors.  {{Sfn|Barisi|pages=14-15}}\n\n==The Villa==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este garden 8.jpg|The Villa seen from the gardens\nFile:Villa Deste entrance 2011 1.jpg|The modest modern entrance to the Villa,  next to the Church of Santa-Maria Maggiore\nFile:Villa d'Este din Tivoli2.jpg|The Courtyard of the Villa was originally the cloister of the convent\nFile:Villa d'Este fuente patio.jpg|The Fountain of Venus in the courtyard retains its original appearance\n</gallery>\nToday the villa is entered from a doorway on the Piazza Trento, next to the entrance of the Church of Santa-Maria Maggiore.  In the time of Ippolito d'Este, this entrance was rarely used;  visitors arrived at the bottom of the gardens, and ascended, step by step, to the villa, viewing the fountains and statuary.  The current door dates to 1521, to the period before Ippolito.  The '''foyer''' inside the door has a painted vault which was once covered with paintings, which were largely destroyed by the bombing during World War II.\nIt was decorated with monochrome scenes from the Old Testament, a few of which, including The Sacrifice of Isaac, still can be seen. They date to the period between 1563\u201365, and were probably designed by GIrolamo Muziano The next room, the '''Hall of the Stories of Solomon''', shows scenes from life of King Solomon, set in frames painted to resemble marble.  They also are attributed to Muziano and his craftsmen, is also from about 1565.  A massive head of travertine stone is on display here, which until the 18th century was in the garden.\n\nThe '''Courtyard''' is placed where the original cloister of the convent was located.  It was constructed in 1566\u201367, and is surrounded by a gallery. The centerpiece of the courtyard is the '''Fountain of Venus''', the only fountain in the Villa which retains its original appearance and decoration. The fountain, designed by Raffaelo Sangallo in 1568\u201369, is framed by two doric columns, and crowned by a 4th-century marble bust of the Emperor Constatine. The central element of the fountain is a Roman statue of a sleeping Venus, made in the 4th or 5th centuries A.D.  Water originally poured from a vase beside her into a Roman [[labrum (architecture)|labrum]] of white marble (2nd century AD) decorated with two lion heads. The fountain is surrounded on three sides by a sixteenth-century courtyard sited on the former Benedictine cloister. The fountain on a side wall contains a grotto and a figure which follows a Hellenistic prototype most familiar in the ''[[Sleeping Ariadne]]'' of the Vatican. The grotto, epitomized by the high-relief stalactites, identifies her as the resident nymph, or ''[[genius loci]]'', though guidebooks sometimes call her a ''Venus''.  The base of the fountain is decorated with a stucco bas relief which was once gilded, and portrays the white heraldic eagles of the D'Este. It illustrates the course of the river flowing from Mount Sant'Angelo to the Villa. The sculptural decoration around the courtyard, particularly the representation of [[quince]] trees, illustrates the 11th labor of [[Hercules]];  the theft of golden apples from the [[Garden of the Hesperides]], where they were guarded by the dragon Ladone.  Hercules was reputed to be a protector of the Tiiburtin region where the villa is located, and also was claimed as an ancestor of the d'Este family. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=23-24}}\n\n===The Apartments of the Cardinal===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa Deste Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 1.jpg|Detail of the wooden ceiling in the bed chamber of Ippolito d'Este\nFile:Vue depuis une fen\u00eatre de la Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Italie.jpg|The view from the apartments of the Cardinal\nFile:000910 tivoli v d este 10 cappella.jpg|The private chapel of the Cardinal\n</gallery>\nThe '''Salon''' on the ground floor is the first room of the personal apartments of Ippolito;  it was used for receptions, and features a spectacular view of the garden below and countryside beyond, including Villa of Hadrian.  The walls, bare today, were covered with leather decorated with gold and green designs and the eagles of the d'Este family. The vaulted ceiling of the room is still covered with a frieze and frescoes on the theme of virtue, painted in twenty different personifications.  These were designed by [[Livio Agresti]] in 1568, and created by a team of artists. and stucco-makers.  Other themes include landscapes with ruined temples, inspired by the Tiburtine countryside.\n\nA small '''antechamber''' next to the salon has a frieze and vault is decorated with more personifications of virtue, and leads to the '''Cardinal's Bedroom''', which was constructed in 1576. The bedroom walls were originally covered with leather painted with gold and silver.  The coffered wooden ceiling is the most notable feature of the room, gilded and painted with the Este crest. an eagle surrounded by quince branches, a bishop's hat and the motto of the Este family, ''ab insomnia non custodita dracone'',  a verse from [[Ovid]] referring to the dragon guarding the gardens of the Hesperides. Feminine figures representing different aspects of virtue occupy the corners of the room.  The private apartment is completed by a library and by a small chapel, whose walls are decorated with frecoes of mixture of classical and Christian symbolism, [[Sibyl]]s and of prophets, and whose ceiling vault features a fresco of the coronation of the Virgin Mary. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=28-32}}  The apartment also connects by doorways with Pirro Ligorio's classical [[Loggia|Gran Loggia]] on the garden facade of the house, based on the terrace below and designed in the form of a great triumphal arch.\n\n===The lower floor===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 5.jpg|Decoration of the First Tiburtine Hall\nFile:Villa Deste Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 10.jpg|Fresco in the Hall of Noah\nFile:Villa Deste Italy interi\u00e9r 2011 8.jpg|The Triumph of Apollo, in the Second Tiburtine Hall\nFile:000910 tivoli v d este 08 stanze.jpg|The Hall of Glory\nFile:010609 04 villadeste.JPG|The Hall of the Hunt\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Deckenfresko 2.jpg|Fresco of ''The Synod of the Gods'' on the ceiling of the Hall of the Fountain\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Deckenfresko 1.jpg|Fresco of Hercules welcomed to Olympus, on the ceiling of the Hall of Hercules\nImage:villa d'este at tivoli paintings arp.jpg|Ceiling fresco of the Second Tiburtine Hall, with scenes from mythology and Roman history\n</gallery>\nThe floor below the Cardinal's personal apartments contains a series of highly decorated rooms, each decorated with a specific theme, all connected to nature, mythology, and water.  The rooms are less formal than those of the apartment above; they were used for private moments in the life of the Cardinal; listening to music or poetry;  conversation, reading, and religious reflection.  They are reached by a large ceremonial stairway that descends from the courtyard, and are connected to each other by a long narrow corridor with a high vaulted ceiling, which receives light from a series of openings to the courtyard above. The ceiling of the corridor is decorated with mosaics from the late 16th century, representing a [[pergola]] inhabited by colorful birds, making the corridor seem a part of the garden. The corridor also features three elaborate rustic fountains, containing miniature grottos framed with columns and pediments.\n\nThe '''Hall of Noah''', like the other rooms on the floor, has walls covered with frescoes designed to resemble tapestries, intertwined with scenes of classical landscapes, ruins, rustic farm houses, and other scenes covering inch of the ceiling and walls,  This room is dated to 1571, at the end of the decoration of the villa, and is attributed to Girolamo Muziano, who was famous for similar scenes of Venetian landscapes. The major scenes portrayed are the Four Seasons, allegories of prudence and temperance, and the central scene of [[Noah]] with the ark shortly after its landing on [[Mount Ararat]], making an agreement with God.  A white eagle, the symbol of the d'Este, is prominently shown landing from the Ark.\n\nThe next room, the '''Hall of Moses,'''  features a fresco in the center of the ceiling showing Moses striking a rock with his rod and bringing forth water for the people of [[Israel]].  This was an allusion to the Cardinal, who had brought water to the Villa gardens by making channels through the rock.  Other panels show scenes from the life of Moses, a [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] with seven heads, the emblem of the family of Ercole I d'Este, an ancestor of Ippolito, and fantastic landscapes.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=36}}\n\nThe '''Hall of Venus''' originally had as its centerpiece a large fountain, with an artificial cliff and grotto framed in stucco.  The fountain a basin of water and a classical statue of a sleeping Venus, but in the 19th century the basin was removed and the Venus, which had been removed after the death of the Cardinal, was replaced by two new statues of Peace and Religion, representing a scene at the grotto of [[Lourdes]].  The original terra cotta floor is still in place, featuring the white eagle of the d'Este family. The only other decoration in the room is the 17th-century painting on the ceiling of angels offering flowers to Venus.\n\nThe First and Second '''Tiburtine Halls''' were created at the same time by a team of painters led by Cesare Nebia, they were made before 1569. and they both have a common plan;  The walls are covered with painted architectural elements, including columns and doors and elaborate painted moldings and sculptural elements, which give the rooms symeframe large number of frescoes. Floral designs fill the spaces between the painted architecture, along with medals, masks, and other insignia.  The decoration of the two rooms illustrates stories from mythology and the history of Tiburtine region, where the villa is located.\n\nThe main theme of the '''Second Tiburtine Hall''' is the story of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]]:  According to mythology, Queen Ida was punished by Jupiter for having raised young Bacchus To avoid the madness of her husband, Atamante, Venus and Neptune transformed her into a seer,  Leucotea.  She traveled to Italy where she lived in the TIburtine forests, giving prophecies, and predicting the birth of Christ. Another TIburtine legend illustrated in the room is that of King Annius, who chased Mercury, the kidnapper of his daughter Cloris, and was drowned in the river [[Aniene]], which takes his name, and which provides the water for the fountains of the Villa. The Sibyl, King Annius, and the personification of the Aniene River all appear in the frescoes of the room, along with the Triumph of Apollo.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=38}}\n\nThe '''First Tiburtine Hall''' illustrates the story of legendary three Greek brothers, [[Tiburtus]], Coras, and Catillus, who defeated the [[Sicels]], an [[Italic peoples|Italic]] tribe, and built a new city, [[Tibur]] (now [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]),  Their battle is illustrated in the central fresco of the ceiling, as are other events in the founding of the region. The decoration of the room also includes the Tenth Labor of Hercules, where he steals a valuable herd of cattle, and is rescued by Zeus, who showers his enemies with stones; as well as pairs of gods and goddesses in painted niches; Vulcan and Venus; Jupiter and Juno; Apollo with Diana; and Bacchus with Circe. On wall is an illustration of the oval fountain, which Ippolito was building at the time the room was decorated.\n\nThe '''Hall of the Fountain''' was used by Cardinal Ippolito as a reception room for guests who had just arrived through the garden below, and for concerts and other artistic events. The room was designed and made between 1565 and 1570, probably by Girolamo Muziano and his team of artists. The central element is a wall fountain, covered with multicolored ceramics and sculpture, encrusted with pieces of glass, seashells and precious stones,  and crowned by the white eagle of the d'Este family. The fountain was finished in 1568 by Paolo Calandrino. The basin of the fountain rests on two stone dolphins.  The reliefs in the central niche depict of the fountain the Tiburtine acropolis and Temple of the Sibyl. On the other walls are images of the house and unfinished garden and fountains, and a small illustration on the opposite wall from the fountain of Ippolito's villa in Rome, on the Quirinal Hill, now a residence of the Pope. The paintings on the ceiling are devoted scenes of mythology;  each corner has portraits of a different gods and goddesses - Tradition says that the painting of Mercury is a self-portrait of Muziano. The central fresco on the ceiling depicts the Synod of the Gods, with Jupiter in the center surrounded by all the gods of Olympus.  The fresco is modeled after a similar work by Raphael in the Loggia of Psyche in the [[Villa Farnesina]]. The hall connects with the loggia, and from there a stairway descends to the garden. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=41-43}}\n\nThe '''Hall of Hercules''' dates to 1565\u201366 and is also by Muziano. The paintings on the ceiling depict eight of the labors of Hercules, surrounded by depictions of landscapes, ancient architecture, and the graces and the virtues. The central painting of the ceiling shows Hercules being welcomed into Olympus by the gods.\n\nThe '''Hall of Nobility''' was the work of a different artist, [[Federico Zuccari]], and his team of painters.  The central fresco on the ceiling depicts \"Nobility on the throne between Liberality and Generosity\".  The decoration on the walls includes paintings of busts of [[Plato]], [[Pyhagoras|Pythagoras]], [[Diogenes]], [[Socrates]] and other classical philosophers, the Graces and Virtues, and [[Diana of Ephesus]], the goddess of Fertility, who also has a fountain dedicated to her in the garden.\n\nThe '''Hall of Glory''' was completed between 1566 and 1577 by Federico Zuccari and eight assistants. It is a masterpiece of Roman [[mannerist]] painting, with painted illusions of doors, windows, tapestries, sculptures, and of everyday objects used by the Cardinal. The central painting of the ceiling, the Allegory of Glory,  has been lost, but there are allegorical depictions of the virtues, the Four Seasons, and of Religion, Magnanimity, Fortune and Time.\n\nThe '''Hall of the Hunt''' is later than the other rooms, from the end of the 16th or beginning the 17th century, and is in a different style;  it features hunting scenes, rural landscapes,  hunting trophies, and, oddly, scenes of naval battles.  A stairway of [[travertine]] stone, called the \"snail stairway\", descends to the garden.  It was originally built to access a [[pallacorda]] Court, an ancestor of tennis, which Ippolito imported into Italy from the French Court.  The space where the court was located now houses the cafeteria and bookstore.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=48}}\n\nThe complete construction and furnishing of Ippolito's apartments was completed in 1572 when Ippolito was on his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.italia.it/en/travel-ideas/unesco-world-heritage-sites/villa-deste-a-triumph-of-the-baroque/brief-history-of-villa-deste.html|title=Brief History of Villa d'Este|date=2012-07-12|website=Italian Tourism Official Website|language=en|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Gardens and Fountains==\n{{Anchor|Description of the garden}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este 01.jpg|The Fountain of Neptune below the Fountain of the Organ\nFile:Fountain Rometta IMG 4167.jpg|The Rometta fountain\nFile:010609 28 villadesteacque.JPG|Neptune's fountain\nFile:Villa d'Este fountains 6.jpg|One hundred fountains\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Fontana dell'Ovato.jpg|The ''Fontana dell'Ovato'' (\"Oval Fountain\") cascades from its egg-shaped basin into a pool set against a rustic [[nymphaeum]].\nFile:Villa Deste park Civetta 2011 14.jpg|The Fountain of the Owl\nFile:Villa Deste park Nature 2011 23.jpg|The Fountain of Diana of Ephesus, or \"Mother Nature\"\n</gallery>\n\nThe fame and glory of the Villa d'Este was above all established by its extraordinary system of fountains;  fifty-one fountains and nymphaeums, 398 spouts, 364 water jets, 64 waterfalls, and 220 basins, fed by 875 meters of canals, channels and cascades, and all working entirely by the force of gravity, without pumps. \n \n[[Pirro Ligorio]], who was responsible for the iconographic programs worked out in the villa's frescos, was also commissioned to lay out the gardens for the villa, with the assistance of [[Tommaso Chiruchi]] of [[Bologna]], one of the most skilled [[hydraulic engineer]]s of the sixteenth century; Chiruchi had worked on the fountains at [[Villa Lante]].  At Villa d'Este he was assisted in the technical designs for the fountains by a Frenchman, [[Claude Venard]], who was a manufacturer of hydraulic [[Organ (music)|organ]]s. The result was one of the finest gardens of the Renaissance, rivaled only by the [[Villa Lante]], the [[Villa Farnese|Villa Farnese at Caprarola]] and the Villas [[Villa Aldobrandini|Aldobrandini]] and [[Villa Torlonia (Frascati)|Torlonia]] in [[Frascati]]. The garden and water features were admired and imitated over the next two centuries in gardens from Portugal to Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe garden plan is laid out on a central axis with subsidiary cross-axes, refreshed by some five hundred jets in fountains, pools and water troughs. The water is supplied by the [[Aniene]], which is partly diverted through the town, a distance of a kilometer, and, originally, by the Rivellese spring, which supplied a cistern under the villa's courtyard (now supplied by the Aniene too). The garden is now part of the [[Grandi Giardini Italiani]].\n\n===The Vialone, or Terrace===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli v d este 000910 03 vialone.jpg|The ''Vialone'', or terrace, at the top of the garden\nFile:Villa d'Este.JPG|The Fountain of the Tripod, with the view of the garden below\nImage:000910 tivoli v d este 47 facciata.jpg|The double loggia provided access to the ceremonial rooms, and a terrace for Cardinal's apartments above\nFile:105TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|The Cenacolo, or Gran Loggia, at the end of the Vialone\n</gallery>\nA large terrace, 200 meters long, called the '''Vialone''', lies between the Villa and the gardens, with a panoramic view of the gardens and countryside beyond. It was constructed between 1568 and 1569. The Cardinals used the space for fireworks, games, spectacles and festivities.  It originally was shaded by two rows of elm trees, except for the space directly in front of the Villa, left empty to preserve the view. The terrace is enclosed at one end by the Fountain of Europa, and at the other by an immense loggia and belvedere in the form of a triumphal arch called the '''Cenacolo'''.  This structure provided shade beneath in summer, as well as commanding viewpoints of the scenery.  It was originally intended to be decorated in the interior with stucco decoration, gilding and frescoes, but it was never finished.\n\nIn the center of the terrace, attached to the facade of the villa, is the double loggia, made in 1566\u20131577 of travertine stone. Its two stairways provide access to the ceremonial salons on the lower floor, while its upper level created a terrace for the Cardinal's apartments.  On the terrace level it contains a '''Nymphaeum''', or grotto,  where the '''Fountain of Leda''' is located. The original statuary of the fountain, depicting Jupiter and Leda transformed into a swan and four children,  Elena, Clytemnestra, Castor and Pollux. was sold in the 18th century and is now in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in Rome. The statuary has been replaced by headless statue of [[Minerva]] found in the garden of the Palazzo Manni in Tivoli.  The original fountain featured a novel hydraulic trick;  water spouting from a vase held by Leda struck a metal disk, which caused flashes of light to reflect on the walls of the grotto. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=51}}\n\nThe '''Fountain of the Tripod''' is placed in the center of the Vialone.  It has only been there since 1930;  it is a copy of an ancient Roman fountain, a marble basin supported by a central column and three pilasters.  The original is now in the [[Louvre]].  The original fountain on the site, the Fountain of the Sea Horses, which was moved by Ippolito from Hadrian's Villa to his garden, is now in the [[Vatican Museum]]. \n \n'''The Fountain of Europa''' is found at the northeast end at the top of the garden.  It was begun by Ippolito but was not finished until 1671.  Its design, a triumphal arch with two orders of columns, corinthian and doric, copying that of the Grand Loggia.  The large niche in the center, now empty, held a sculpture ''Europa Embracing the Bull'' which is now in the VIlla Albani in Rome.\n\n=== The upper garden ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:000910 tivoli v d este 41 facciata.jpg|The Fountain of the Bicchierone, by [[Bernini]], and the Loggetta of the Cardinal\nFile:Villa d'Este Fountain of Bicchierone.jpg|The Fountain of the Bicchierone, seen from the Terrace\nFile:Villa d'Este fountain 5.jpg|Mask spouting water in the Grotto of Pomona\n File:Tivoli Villa dEste 18.jpg|The Fountain of Pegasus\n</gallery>\nTwo ramps lead down to the upper garden from Fountain of the Tripod, and there are symmetrical double flights of stairs at either end.  The '''Cardinal's Walk''' is a shaded path,  attached to the retaining wall of the terrace, which leads from one side of the garden to the other, passing by several grottos which are built into the retaining wall.  At the southeast end of the walk, just below the Fountain of Europa, is the '''Grotto of Igea and Aesculpius'''.  The grotto is decorated with tartar flakes, mosaics and colored fragments of sea shells, and a small portion of the original fresco.  It originally held two statues; that of Aesculpius, the god of medicine, now found in the [[Louvre]], and of [[Igea]], the daughter of Auesculpius, the goddess of healing (now in the Vatican Museum).\n\nThe '''Loggia of Pandora''' is found in the middle of the Cardinal's Walk, just below the center of the Villa.  This portion of the walk is covered, with arcades looking out at the garden. It contained a nymphaeum built into the wall, and originally was decorated with mosaics and with a statue of [[Pandora]] and two statues of [[Minerva]].  The statue of Pandora carried a vase of water, symbolizing the evils of the world. The vase was a concealed fountain, pouring out water. The statues were sold in the 18th century;  Pandora and one of the Minervas are now in the [[Capitoline Museum]].  In the 19th century the nymphaeum was converted into a Christian chapel;  it was a favorite place of the composer Franz Liszt, who dedicated two pieces of music to the chapel. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=54}}\n\nThe '''Fountain of the Bicchierone''' is one of two fountains created for the Villa by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  It was made between 1660 and 1661 on a commission from Cardinal Rinaldo I d'Este. The basin of the fountain is in the form of a large shell, which reaches up to the level of the terrace. In the center is a toothed ''Bicchierone'' (cup or chalice) from which the water sprays upwards.  Bernini supervised the building of the fountain, and, following its inauguration in May 1661, he had the height of the spouting water reduced, to avoid blocking the view from the Loggia of Pandora.  Though not part of the original design of the garden, the fountain became a link between the architecture of the palace and the garden. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=56}}\n\nThe '''Loggetta of the Cardinal''' is a small [[Baluster|balustraded]] terrace surrounded by high laurel hedges and stone benches,  between the Fountain of the Biccherone and the garden.  This was said to be the Cardinal's favorite spot for reading and discussing poetry and art, and watching the construction of the garden around him.  Shortly after his death, a large statue of Hercules, with the boy Achilles in his arms, was placed there, overlooking the garden below. It was one of three statues of Hercules in central positions along the central axis.  When seen from the bottom the garden, they were all visible, aligned with the Loggia of the Villa at the top. The statue is now found in the [[Louvre]].\n\nThe '''Grotto of Diana''' is located at the end of the Cardinal's Walk, below the '''Gran Loggia'''.  It is a large underground vaulted chamber, decorated in 1570-72 by Paolo Caladrino, and completely covered with mosaics of mythological scenes, with images of fish, dragons, dolphins, pelicans and other animals, as well as the eagles and apples of the d'Este family. Its central feature was a rustic fountain with statue of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], in a large niche decorated with stuccol reliefs of landscapes, the sea and a ship.  All of the statues were sold in the 18th century and are now in the [[Capitoline Museum]] in Rome. Some of the original [[majolica]] floor tiles from the 16th century can still be seen.\n\nBelow the Loggetta of the Cardinal is a walkway which traverses the garde\n\npasses by three grottos. In the center is the '''Grotto of Hercules''',  which is covered by the Loggetta of the Cardinal. Beneath this grotto was a cistern and some of the hydraulic machinery for the fountains below. The grotto once had stucco reliefs of either animals or the labors of Hercules. The statue of Hercules in repose formerly in the grotto is now in the Vatican Museum. The '''Grotto of Pomona''' is similar in design to the Grotto of Hercules.  Some of the original mosaic decoration is still visible.  The water poured into a fountain from a white marble mask, which was found when the fountain was restored in 2002.\n\n===The Oval Fountain (''Fontana dell'Ovato'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli Villa dEste 26.jpg|The Oval Fountain\nFile:Ovato.TIF|The oval fountain, seen from the terrace\nFile:Big fountain in Tivoli (3396134588).jpg|The statue of the Sibyl Albunensa over the fountain, and the artificial mountains behind it.\n</gallery>\nThe '''Oval Fountain''' was one of the first fountains in the garden, and among the most famous.  It was designed by [[Pirro Ligorio]], the architect of the villa, as a water theater, spraying water in variety of forms.  It was begun in 1565 and finished in 1570. It was made by fountain engineers Tomasso de Como and Curzio Maccarono, with sculpture by Raffaello Sangallo. A massive stone basin against the semicircular back wall cascades water into the fountain, and sprays it into the air, while water jets into the basin from vases in the hands of statues of [[Nereids]], and also sprays in fan shapes from vases in niches in the semi-circular wall behind the fountain.  An artificial mountain rises above the fountain, symbolizing the Tiburtine landscape;  the mountain is pierced by three grottos, each pouring forth water, and is decorated with statues representing the Sibyl Albunesa with her son Melicerte, by Gillis van den Vliete (1568), and statues representing rivers Erculaneo and Anio, by Giovanni Malanca (1566), all of which pour water into the Oval Fountain.  An upper walkway above the fountain leads past the ring of basins and cascades. The fountain also has its own grotto, the '''Grotto of Venus''', designed by Pirro Ligorio, and built in 1565\u201368.  It served as a meeting place for guests on hot summer days. The original statues of the grotto; a figure of Venus similar to the Capitoline Venus and two ''putti'' are no longer there, but traces of the monochrome murals of grotesque figures, tiles and sculpted grotto walls still remain. {{sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=57-58}}\n\n===The Hundred Fountains (''Cento Fontane'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:066TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|The Hundred Fountains\nFile:IT-Tivoli-villa-este-wasserspeier.jpg|A mask of the Hundred Fountains\nFile:064TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|Detail of the Hundred Fountains\nFile:Fontaines de lall\u00e9e aux Cent-Fontaines (Tivoli) (5868497891).jpg|A d'Este eagle among the spouts in the Hundred Fountains\n</gallery>\nThe Hundred Fountains were another celebrated marvel of the gardens in the Renaissance. They are located between the oval fountain and the Fontana di Rometta, and there are actually nearly three hundred spouts fed by three parallel canals, one above the other. Along the edge of the upper canal there are spouts in the form of lilies, the emblem of France, alternating with the d'Este eagle, boats and obelisks; all spraying water in a fan shape. The water is captured by the second canal, which feeds it into spouts in the form of masks, from which it reaches the lower canal.\n\nThe fountains were constructed between 1566 and 1577. The original alley of fountains had more decoration, including small boats alternating with terra cotta vases along the upper canal, planted with fruit trees;  and the wall was decorated with sculptural plaques showing scenes from the ''Metamorphosis'' of [[Ovid]]. These deteriorated quickly and were largely removed or replaced. The wall is now so overgrown with vegetation that little of remaining decoration can be seen. It was restored in the 17th century, then abandoned for a long period, and finally restored again in 1930 to its present form.  Like every other feature of the garden, canals and the hundred fountains had their part in the symbolic plan; they represented the aqueducts the Romans built to supply water to Rome.  The Hundred Fountains have been celebrated in Italian art and literature, particularly in the ''Roman Elegies'' of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=62-63}}\n\nTo descend to the next level, there are stairs at either end \u2013 the elaborate fountain complex called the ''Rometta'' (\"the little Rome\") is at the far left \u2013 to view the full length of the ''Hundred Fountains'' on the next level, where the water jets fill the long rustic trough, and Pirro Ligorio's ''Fontana dell'Ovato'' ends the cross-vista. A visitor may walk behind the water through the [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] arcade of the concave [[nymphaeum]], which is peopled by marble nymphas by [[Giambattista della Porta]]. Above the nymphaeum, the sculpture of ''[[Pegasus]]'' recalls to the visitor the fountain of [[Hippocrene]] on [[Parnassus]], haunt of the [[Muse]]s.\n\nThis terrace is united to the next by the central Fountain of the Dragons, dominating the central perspective of the gardens, erected for a visit in 1572 of [[Pope Gregory XIII]] whose coat-of-arms features a dragon. The sound of this fountain was in contrast to a nearby ''Uccellario'' with artificial birds.<ref>It was said by the traveler Raymond, that theses fountains \"vomit forth the water with a most horrid noise\" [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_yRBliCBdNNAC An Itinerary: Contayning a Voyage, Made Through Italy, in the Yeare 1646]; by John Raymond, p. 171.</ref> Central stairs lead down a wooded slope to three rectangular fishponds set on the cross-axis at the lowest point of the gardens, terminated at the right by the water organ (now brought back into use) and Fountain of Neptune (belonging to the 20th century restorations).\n\n===The Fountain of Rometta ({{lang|it|Fontana di Rometta}})===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:052TivoliVillaDEste.jpg|The Rometta fountain, a miniature of ancient Rome\nFile:Detail from the Villa d'Este, 2015-05-19-5.jpg|The boat with an obelisk mast, symbolizing the Tiburtina island in the Tiber, below the statue of Rome Triumphant\nFile:La Rometta (Tivoli) (5868497139).jpg|Statues symbolizing the Aniene River (left) and Apennine mountains (right)\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of Rometta is located at the opposite end of the Hundred Fountains from the Oval Fountain. It is an important piece of the symbolic story told by the upper gardens;  the waters of the Tiber River emerge in the Tiburtin Mountains, symbolized by the Oval Fountain, run through the valley (The Hundred Fountains) and arrive at the gates of Rome;  the Rometta Fountain is Ancient Rome in miniature;  the real city was visible in the distance behind the Fountain. The fountain was designed by Pirro Ligorio and built by Curzio Maccarone between 1567 and 1570.  The fountain and its architecture are built on a wide semicircular Terrace supported by pilasters connected with a double arcades.  The back portion of the fountain represents the buildings the monuments if Rome; deteriorated greatly in the early 19th century, and a large part was demolished in 1850, but a portion of this architecture still stands on the left side of the fountain. The small buildings were divided into seven sections, representing the seven hills of Rome and their most famous monuments. The little city included gates and arches, and even small marble statues.  In the center of the miniature city is a large statue of ''Rome Victorious,''  made in 1568 by the Fliemish sculptor Pierre de la Motte, facing the statue of the Tiburtine Sibyl at the other end of the row of Hundred Fountains. Another statue by the same artist, ''The She Wolf nurses her Twins'', was placed in the garden in 1611.  The water flowing through fountain basin next to the city represents the Tiber River; the boat in the fountain, with a mast in the form an obelisk, symbolizes the Tiburtina Island.\n\nA new feature was added to the Fountain of Rometta in the early 17th century; an artificial mountain, pierced by grottos and caves, to left of the city buildings. On the top of the artificial mountain is a statue of the river god Aniene, holding in his hand a miniature of the Temple of the Sibyl. A statue of a figure representing the Apennine mountains, holding a mountain in his arms. is half-hidden in a grotto. {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=87-89}}\n\n===The Fountain of the Dragons (''Fontana dei Draghi'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli Villa dEste 29.jpg|The jet of the Fountain of the Dragons, viewed from below\nFile:Fontana del Drago 03.TIF|The four dragons\nFile:Fontana del Drago 05.TIF|A dolphin in the fountain of the dragons\nFile:010609 20 villadestedrago.JPG|The fountain of the dragons from above\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of the Dragons was designed by PIrro Ligorio to illustrate the story of Hercules fulfilling one of his labors by stealing the golden apples of the [[Garden of the Hesperides]], which were guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].  The same story is illustrated in frescoes in the interior decoration of the Villa.\n\nThe fountain is located on the central vertical axis of the gardens, aligned with the Villa, and in the center of the original garden. just below the Hundred Fountains.  It is enclosed by two semi-circular ramps which lead to the level above.  The walls of the ramps around it are covered with pebbly tartar and ornamented with bands of mosaic and majolica tile, and contain two large niches. Ligorio planned this fountain to illustrate the theme of war and combat against evil; he intended that one niche would be occupied by a statue of Hercules with his club, before he killed the dragon Ladon; and the second with statues of Mars, the god of War, [[Perseus]], and gladiators. In the center of the fountain is a small ''scogliera'' or island, which holds four sculpted dragons, which jet water from their mouths into the fountain, while a powerful central fountain shoots a column of water vertically high in the air, visible from all around the garden This idea of a vertical jet of water as the centerpiece of the garden was copied in many baroque gardens in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In addition to the dragons, two sculpted dolphins spray water across the pool. More water flows down from above, running in channels attached to the parapets of the ramps. The water emerges from the breasts of two [[sphinxes]]- half-women, half sea horses;  flows down a channel, enters the mouth of a sculpted frog, and emerges again through the mouth of a carved [[salamander]]. In keeping with the theme of combat against evil, in Ippolito's time the fountains also produced dramatic sound effects heard throughout the garden;  water kept under pressure was suddenly released, imitating the sound of fireworks or cannons firing.  To make more noise, the flow of water from above could also be from a fine spray to a heavy downpour.\n\nIppolito had the fountain altered for the visit of Pope Gregory in 1572.  The dragon with one hundred heads was replaced by four dragons, the family emblem of the Pope.  Ippolito died three months later, and the fountain was still not completed.  It was not finished until late in the 17th century with a different sculptural program;  Instead of a statue of Hercules, a statue of the god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] holding lightning bolts in his hands was placed in the central niche. The cannon-like sound effects from the fountain now were meant to be the sound of his thunderbolts.\n.{{Sfn|Barisi|2004|page=89}}\n\n===The Fountain of the Owl  (''Fontana della Civetta'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Civetta 03.TIF|Mosaic decoration on the columns depicting the Golden Apples of the Hesperides\nFile:Detail from the Villa d'Este, 2015-05-19-8.jpg|Courtyard of the Fountain of the Owl\nFile:Tivoli Villa dEste 24.jpg|The Fountain of the Owl. Some of the original sculptural figures are replaced by cutouts.\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of the Owl is located in the Southwest part of the garden, below the Fountain of Rometta and the Fountain of Proserpina, These three fountains form a single unit of architecture, their terraces connected by stairways,  with nymphaeums placed beneath the terraces. The Fountain of the Owl was built between 1565 and 1569 by Giovanni del Duca.  Compared with other fountains in the garden, it is very formal,  placed on a terrace surrounded by walls with niches, crowned with the white eagles and lily symbols of the d'Este. The fountain itself is a separate structure, entirely covered with polychrome tiles.  At the top, above the niche, is the coat of arms of the d'Este, held by two angels.  The niche is flanked by ionic columns.  Originally it contained the statues of two youths holding a goatskin which poured water into a basin held by three satyrs. The sculpture in the niche,  believed lost, was rediscovered during a renovation in 2001\u201302, hidden under mineral deposits and earth. The architectural elements were intact, but the figures of the youths and satyrs were missing or destroyed.\n\nThis fountain also produced music, thanks to an ingenious automaton made by the French fountain engineer Luc Leclerc, installed in 1566, before the Fountain of the Organ on the other side of the garden.  It featured twenty painted bronze birds placed in the niche, posed on two metal olive branches.  Each bird sang an individual song, produced by piped water and air. A mechanical owl appeared, and the birds stopped singing;  then, at the end of the performance,  all the birds sang together.  This musical feature was admired and copied in other European gardens, and functioned until the end of the 17th century.  It needed constant repair due to the action of the water on its delicate mechanism, and by the 19th century were completely ruined.  The decorative elements of the fountain were completely restored in the 1930s, and restored again in 2001\u20132002, {{Sfn|Barisi|2004|pages=82-85}}\n\nDuring the restoration work of 2001\u201302, the workers found some of the original mechanism that produced the bird songs, including the wind chamber, the tubes that moved the air and water, and the machinery that made the owl move.  Using modern materials, Leonardo Lombardi was able to make a new version of the old machinery so the birds can sing and move again.\n\n===The Fountain of the Proserpina (''Fontana di Proserpina'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa d'Este din Tivoli - Fontana di Proserpina1.jpg|Stairway from the Fountain of the Owl up to the Fountain of Proserpina, with Rometta Fountain visible above\nFile:Villa Deste park Proserpina 2011 17.jpg|The Fountain of Proserpina\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of Proserpina is located just above the Fountain of the Owl and connects with it by a stairway. It was sometimes called the Fountain of the Emperors, because it was originally intended to display statues of four Roman Emperors who had villas in the region: [[Julius Caesar]], [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]].  It was designed and built by Alberto Galvani in 1569\u201370.  It was connected with the Rometta Fountain above by two stairways (only one remains today) whose parapets support channels of water pouring through shells and masks.  The stairways close two sides of the small fountain courtyard.  The fountain is placed in a triumphal arch between the stairways.  The arch is framed by twisting columns, similar to those in Saint Peter's basilica in Rome. The central niche held a statue of the goddess of fertility [[Proserpina]] being kidnapped by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], placed there in about 1640.  The statue of Proserpina has disappeared;  Pluto remains, carried on a shell supported by two sea horses. Niches on the sides hold statues of [[triton (mythology)|Tritons]] riding dolphins and blowing on their ''buccina'', or seashell trumpets.\n\n===The Fountain of the Organ (''Fontana dell\u2019Organo'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Fontana dell'Organo 07.TIF|Detail of the Fountain of the Organ\nFile:Fontana dellOrgano (Tivoli) (5868495711).jpg|The Fountain of the Organ, with its ''Castellum aqua'', or water castle, behind it.\nFile:Fontana dell'Organo 01.JPG|The kiosk containing the keyboard of the water organ\nFile:Fontana dell'Organo 03.TIF|Statue of Apollo on the facade of the Water Castle.\n</gallery>\nThe Fountain of the Organ (\u2018\u2019Fontana dell\u2019Organo\u2019\u2019) is one of the most famous features of the garden; it was described and imitated throughout Europe. Work on the masonry structure began in 1566.  The fountain itself was made by the French fountain engineer Luc Leclerc and his nephew Claude Venard.  After the death of Leclerc Venard invented the ingenious mechanism of the water organ, which was installed in 1571.\n\nThe fountain was the first of its kind, and astonished everyone who heard it;  when Pope Gregory XIII visited the villa in 1572, accompanied by his court of cardinals and princes, he insisted on inspecting the interior of the fountain, to learn if someone wasn\u2019t concealed inside making the music.\n\nA massive masonry arch behind the fountain, the \u2018\u2019castellum aquae\u2019\u2019 or water castle,  conceals the water reservoir and the hydraulic machinery of the fountain. The original design featured a grotto in the niche of the arch, with a view of the twenty-two pipes of the organ. A statue of \u2018\u2019Mother Nature\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2019Ephesian Diana\u2019\u2019 was placed in front of the arch in 1569;  it now has its own fountain in the lower garden.\n\nThe water creating the music arrived first at the top of the \u2018\u2019Castellum aquae\u2019.  It went first through a series of whirlpools, which mixed air with the water; then it dropped down a pipe into the \u2018\u2019camera aeolia\u2019\u2019, or wind chamber, where the air and water were separated;  the water turned a wheel, rotating a cylinder which opened the valves of the twenty-two pipes, so the air could pass through the pipes and make the music.\n\nThe original performances of the fountain began with the sound of two trumpets, held by the statue of Fame on the cornice of the fountain. Then came the music, likely [[madrigals]] played by four or five pipes;  then the climax:  \u201cThe Flood\u201d, a cascade of water from the top of the fountain, and jets of water shooting up from the fountain below.  This was accompanied by the sound of a horn held by a \u2018\u2019Triton\u2019\u2019 in the fountain;  the horn blew softly, then loudly, then softly again.\n\nThe mechanism of the fountain was extremely delicate and required continual cleaning and maintenance.  The fountain was restored in the early 18th century by Cardinal Alessandro d\u2019Este, who added the white d\u2019Este eagle to the top of the \u2018\u2019castellum aquae\u2019\u2019,  and ornamented the facade with statues of [[Orpheus]] and [[Apollo]]; [[Caryatids]] and Winged Victories;  and bas-reliefs of Orpheus entrancing the animals and a musical contest between Apollo and Marsia.  The organ itself was entirely redone.  It was given a keyboard with a wider range of notes and was housed in an octagonal kiosk with a cupola. The organ was restored several more times in the 17th century, but by the end of the 18th century, it had deteriorated beyond hope of repair.\n\nIn 2003,  after a long and delicate restoration, the organ was able to play again. The original wind chamber and tank for creating whirlpools were retained, and the rest of the mechanism was replaced with new machinery in modern materials following the original principles. It now has 144 pipes, and is controlled by a cylinder, operated by the water, which can play four pieces of late Renaissance music for a total of four minutes.\n\n===The Fountain of Neptune (''Fontana di Nettuno'') and the Fish ponds (''Peschiere'')===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tivoli, Villa d'Este, Querachse mit Neptunbrunnen und Wasserorgel 1.jpg|The Fountain of Neptune across the fish ponds\nFile:Fontana di Nettuno (Tivoli) (5868499091).jpg|The fountain of Neptune\nFile:Peschiera by M.Hermoso.TIF|Border of the fish ponds\nFile:Villa d'Este fountain and pools.jpg|The fish ponds seen from the Fountain of the Organ\n</gallery>\n\nDirectly below the Fountain of the Organ, and receiving the water from the upper fountain, is the Fountain of Neptune, a work created in the 20th century to replace a garden landmark which had deteriorated.\n\nThe space was originally occupied by a rocky cascade, created in the 17th century by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  It was commissioned by Cardinal Rinado I d\u2019Este as a background for the lateral axis of the garden, unfinished by Cardinal Ippolito.  Bernini's plan called for a waterfall from the Fountain of the Organ which leaped over the grottoes of the Sibyls, then cascaded down a rocky slope to a lake decorated with reefs and statues.  Two additional cascades entered the lake from the sides.  Bernini designed the cascade to produce a thunderous sound of falling water.  Bernini's cascade was reproduced in paintings and engravings, and was imitated in other gardens in Italy and as far away as England.  Unfortunately, the cascade was entirely neglected for two centuries, dry, crumbling and overgrown with vegetation.  In the 1930s the architect Attilio Rossi created the present fountain, using what remained of Bernini's cascade.  Against the wall of the Grottoes of the Sibyls, he built rectangular pools with powerful water jets, the tallest jets in the center.  The centerpiece was a grotto beneath the waterfall from the Fountain of the Organ; the grotto contained a 16th-century torso of a statue of Neptune, which had originally been intended for an unfinished fountain of the seas. Other jets of water in fan shapes rise from pools on the sides of the fountain.\n\nThe three fish ponds (''Peschiere'') cross the garden from the Fountain of Neptune.  They served originally to provide fresh fish, duck, and swan for the table of the Cardinal, and also, in the plan of Pirro Ligorio,  were intended to connect two fountains;  the Fountain of the Organ and the cascade and the Fountain of the Seas. In the center of the ponds, Ligorio had originally planned to create a central pond with monumental fountains.  However, when Ippolito died in 1572 only two of the ponds had been completed. In the late 16th century the ponds were lined by sixteen tall pilasters in the form of ''ermes'' which jetted out fan-shaped sprays of water, creating a multitude of rainbows on a sunny day.\n\nIn 1632 the Duke of Modena, in charge of the Villa, entirely remodeled the ponds.  The pilasters were removed and replaced with eight pedestals with vases which spouted water, and with twenty-four large pots containing a variety of citrus trees. The ponds now serve primarily as a picturesque foreground for cascades and fountains of the Fountain of Neptune.\n\n==The Lower Garden - The Rotonda of the Cypresses and the Fountain of Diana of Ephesus==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Villa Deste park Nature 2011 23.jpg|The Fountain of Diana of Ephesus\nFile:Villa d'Este din Tivoli - Fontane delle Mette.jpg|The Mette fountains in the lower garden\nFile:Aquile estensi 01.TIF|Fountain of the d'Este eagles\n</gallery>\n\nIn the 16th century the lower garden, below the fishponds,  was originally largely a kitchen garden. The center of the lower garden was divided into sixteen large squares, with a pergola in the center of each section, surrounded by beds of medicinal herbs and flowers, and large pots of fruit trees.  The main paths dividing the garden were covered with trellises on which grew grapes, heather and [[jasmine]]. In the center was a large wooden pavilion, which contained four small fountains in the form of flowers, jetting water.  The pergolas and pavilion were demolished in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and replaced by the '''Rotonda of the Cypresses''', a circular alley which originally contained sixteen cypress trees, and offered shade to visitors arriving in the gardens, as well as a dramatic view of the rest of the garden, the fountains and the Villa high above.  By the 19th century the cypress trees were huge, and were among the most famous features of gardens, painted by artists and inspiring music by [[Franz Liszt]] and poetry by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]].  Two of the original cypress trees are still there; the other cypresses and laurel hedges were planted at the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe '''Fountains of the d'Este eagle''' are a group of small rustic fountains, with water spurting up from stone bowls, with a variety of themes.  One contains a group of statues of the white eagle, the emblem of the d'Este family.  These fountains are a vestige the formal gardens that occupied that part of the garden before the Rotonda of Cypresses was built.\n\nThe lower garden also contains two large rustic fountains, called the '''Mete''', located on the northwest corner of the garden near the entrance. They were designed to look like natural rock, with grottos and niches.  Created in 1568\u201369, they were made by Tommaso da Como, and were originally intended to feature two large statues of giants, the guardians of the garden.  A smaller rustic fountain, called the '''Fontana Rustca dell'Inverno''', holds a 16th-century statue of Winter that originally was in the Gran Loggia.\n\nThe most famous fountain in the lower garden is the '''Fountain of Diana of Ephesus''', also known as the Fountain of Mother Nature. This statue originally stood next to the Fountain of the Organ;  it was moved to the lower garden by Alessandro d'Este in the 16th century.  It was made by the Flemish sculptor Gillis van den Vliete in 1568, and modeled after a classical Roman statue of [[Diana of Ephesus]] from the second century, now in the National Museum of Naples.  It stands in a grotto made of tartar flakes;  jets of water spurt from the multiple breasts of the goddess.\n\n==The Villa d'Este in Art==\nFew gardens have been painted or drawn by as many notable artists than the Villa d'Este, particularly during the Renaissance and in the 19th century. As a result, features of the garden influenced and were imitated in other gardens across Europe, from England to Russia. In the Renaissance, the garden was seen as a showcase of classical art and new technology, but by the end of the 18th century, when the garden was overgrown and crumbling, it helped created the image of the picturesque romantic garden. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Piranesi-16049.jpg|The Villa d'Este gardens by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] (1761)\nFile:Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard - Cypress Avenue at the Villa d`Este in Tivoli, 1774 - Google Art Project.jpg|Cypress Avenue at Villa d'Este by [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]] (1774)\nFile:Hubert Robert - The Oval Fountain in the Gardens of the Villa d'Este, Tivoli - Google Art Project.jpg|Drawing of the Oval Fountain by [[Hubert Robert]] (1733\u20131808)\nFile:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Villa d'Este - Google Art Project.jpg|The Villa d'Este by [[J.M.W.

'''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

'''Northwest Indian War''' (1785\u20131795), also known as the '''Ohio War''', '''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled.  As expected, Tachnechdorus took revenge, and was supported by the Shawnee, who expressed discontent that they had still not been paid for their lands.{{r|Calloway|p=208}}.

This city and the adjacent Town of [[Redcliff, Alberta|Redcliff]] to the northwest are within  [[Cypress County]]. Medicine Hat was the [[List of cities in Alberta|sixth-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,230.\n\nStarted as a railway town, today Medicine Hat is served by the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]]) and the eastern terminus of the [[Crowsnest Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]]).  Nearby communities considered part of the Medicine Hat area include the Town of Redcliff (abutting the city's northwest boundary) and the hamlets of [[Desert Blume]], [[Dunmore, Alberta|Dunmore]], [[Irvine, Alberta|Irvine]], [[Seven Persons]], and [[Veinerville]]. The [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] (including [[Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park]]) is a relatively short distance (by car) to the southeast of the city.\n\nHistorically, Medicine Hat has been known for its large [[natural gas]] fields, being immortalized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] as having \"all hell for a basement\".<ref>{{Citation| last=Brennan| first=Brian| year=2003| title=Boondoggles, Bonanzas, and Other Alberta Stories| publisher=Fifth House| isbn=1-894004-94-9 |page=43 |quote=This part of the country seems to have all hell for a basement, and the only trap door appears to be in Medicine Hat.

Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] and the [[Cree]] in which a retreating Cree \"Medicine Man\" lost his headdress in the [[South Saskatchewan River]].\n\nA number of natural factors have always made Medicine Hat a gathering place. The gently sloping valley with its converging waterways and hardy native [[Populus|cottonwood]] trees attracted both the migratory [[American bison|bison]] herds which passed through the area, and humans who used the waterways and hunted the bison. Before Europeans arrived, the historic Blackfoot, Cree and [[Assiniboine]] nations used the area for hundreds of years, but they had been preceded for thousands of years by previous indigenous cultures.\n\nBeginning in 1971, archeological excavations supervised by scholars from [[Medicine Hat College]] (MHC) were conducted at what became known as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the [[Old Women's Phase]] to archeologists. They found \"quantities of stone tools, fire cracked rock, butchered bone and pottery\", marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They \"excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate the Saamis Site was initially occupied about AD 1500 and again around AD 1750\",<ref name=\"milne\">[https://www.mhc.ab.ca/alumni/real/real50/8_archaeology Dr. Laurie Milne, \"Uncovering Medicine Hat's history\"]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Medicine Hat College website, 2010</ref> well before most European contact.\n\nAlso in this area, further to the west, other MHC students and faculty were part of an excavation in 2000 at what became known as the Hillside Campsite, where two layers of finds were made. The upper layer had artifacts from the Old Women's Phase, but the lower layers were found to be much older, containing [[Pelican Lake Phase]] remains that were dated to between 1000 and 1500 BC.<ref name=\"milne\"/>\n\n=== Modern founding ===\n[[File:Medicine Hat Station 1906 0664-0001.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian Pacific Railway Station (1906)]]\nIn 1883, when the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) reached Medicine Hat and crossed the river, European Canadians established a town site. They named it from the [[First Nations]] legends. As growth took place, in 1889 Medicine Hat built the first hospital west of [[Winnipeg]]. The CPR established this town as a railway  [[divisional point]]. The frontier settlement was incorporated as a town on October 31, 1898, and as a city on May 9, 1906. Medicine Hat is halfway between Winnipeg and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast.\n\n=== Progress and growth ===\nRich in natural resources including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and was known in its early days as \"the [[Pittsburgh]] of the West\", referring to the industrial city in western Pennsylvania of the United States. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, pottery and glass bottle manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909\u20131914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.\n\nDuring World War II, one of the largest [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s (P.O.W.) in Canada was established here in the mid-1940s, used primarily to hold German and Italian prisoners. It was not until the 1950s of the post-war period that the town again had commercial growth.\n\nIn the 21st century, Medicine Hat promotes its quality of life and affordable cost of living, enjoying the savings of a city-owned gas utility and power generation plant. Major industries have included chemical plants, a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s),<ref>[http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile \"I-XL Industries Acquired by Friends of Medalta in Hope of Preserving Medicine Hat's Industrial Heritage\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709030954/http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile |date=July 9, 2013 }}</ref> to name a few. Friends of Medalta is a non-profit that has been formed to preserve some of the city's industrial heritage.\n\n[[File:Medicine Hat Teepee at Night, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Teepee at night]]\n[[File:Medicine Hat Speedway Derby, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Speedway Derby]]\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Medicine Hat landscape is dominated by the South Saskatchewan River valley. In addition, the tributaries Seven Persons Creek and Ross Creek both flow into the South Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the city. These waterways have cut a dramatic valley landscape with numerous cliffs, and finger [[coulee]]s throughout the city. Beyond the city and river valley, the land is flat to slightly rolling and is characterized by short-grass vegetation.\n\nLocated about {{cvt|40|km}} to the east at {{Coord|50|0|38.2|N|110|6|48.3|W|scale:7500|name=Badlands Guardian}} lies the [[Badlands Guardian|Badlands Guardian Geological Feature]].

He had purchased the land and a team of horses for $40.00 in 1895. The family kept the property for three generations, using part of it as a campground in the early 20th century. In 1930, they built the Maple Leaf motel on the property to generate some income. In 1990 a local family bought the property. With a view toward keeping the prominent property as part of the community, they adapted it as the Saamis Memorial Funeral Chapel & Crematorium.\n\nNow named the ''Saamis Teepee'', this work of public art is the world's tallest [[Tipi|teepee]]. It was installed in 1991 south of the Trans-Canada Highway and at the edge of the Blackfoot [[buffalo jump]], above the Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek. Commissioned for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]] as a symbol of Canada's Plains Indians, it stood {{cvt|215| feet}} high (more than 20 storeys) and is {{cvt|160| feet}} in diameter at the base. The sculpture was designed by Steve Illes of steel and concrete. He had the teepee painted \"white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun, and blue for flowing waters\". Within the teepee are ten circles, with painted illustrations that express ideas about the cultures of the Plains tribes. Explanation are on plaques set in the base.<ref name=\"peters\">[http://hammersonpeters.com/?p=500 \"The Saamis Tepee\"], in ''The Great White North'', Hammerson Peters website</ref>\n\nAlthough designed to withstand extreme temperatures and winds up to {{cvt|240|km/h}}, during a severe windstorm in January 2007, a portion of the teepee was damaged. Inspection revealed that extensive weathering had weakened the structure. The necessary repairs resulted in lowering the height of Saamis Teepee by approximately {{cvt|15|ft}}.\n\n=== Parks ===\nThere are over {{cvt|100|km}} of walking trails in the city.

It is located along the [[South Saskatchewan River]]. It is approximately {{cvt|169|km}} east of [[Lethbridge]] and {{cvt|295|km}} southeast of [[Calgary]]. This city and the adjacent Town of [[Redcliff, Alberta|Redcliff]] to the northwest are within  [[Cypress County]]. Medicine Hat was the [[List of cities in Alberta|sixth-largest city in Alberta]] in 2016 with a population of 63,230.\n\nStarted as a railway town, today Medicine Hat is served by the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]]) and the eastern terminus of the [[Crowsnest Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]]).  Nearby communities considered part of the Medicine Hat area include the Town of Redcliff (abutting the city's northwest boundary) and the hamlets of [[Desert Blume]], [[Dunmore, Alberta|Dunmore]], [[Irvine, Alberta|Irvine]], [[Seven Persons]], and [[Veinerville]]. The [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] (including [[Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park]]) is a relatively short distance (by car) to the southeast of the city.\n\nHistorically, Medicine Hat has been known for its large [[natural gas]] fields, being immortalized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] as having \"all hell for a basement\".<ref>{{Citation| last=Brennan| first=Brian| year=2003| title=Boondoggles, Bonanzas, and Other Alberta Stories| publisher=Fifth House| isbn=1-894004-94-9 |page=43 |quote=This part of the country seems to have all hell for a basement, and the only trap door appears to be in Medicine Hat.

Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] and the [[Cree]] in which a retreating Cree \"Medicine Man\" lost his headdress in the [[South Saskatchewan River]].\n\nA number of natural factors have always made Medicine Hat a gathering place. The gently sloping valley with its converging waterways and hardy native [[Populus|cottonwood]] trees attracted both the migratory [[American bison|bison]] herds which passed through the area, and humans who used the waterways and hunted the bison. Before Europeans arrived, the historic Blackfoot, Cree and [[Assiniboine]] nations used the area for hundreds of years, but they had been preceded for thousands of years by previous indigenous cultures.\n\nBeginning in 1971, archeological excavations supervised by scholars from [[Medicine Hat College]] (MHC) were conducted at what became known as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the [[Old Women's Phase]] to archeologists. They found \"quantities of stone tools, fire cracked rock, butchered bone and pottery\", marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They \"excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate the Saamis Site was initially occupied about AD 1500 and again around AD 1750\",<ref name=\"milne\">[https://www.mhc.ab.ca/alumni/real/real50/8_archaeology Dr. Laurie Milne, \"Uncovering Medicine Hat's history\"]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Medicine Hat College website, 2010</ref> well before most European contact.\n\nAlso in this area, further to the west, other MHC students and faculty were part of an excavation in 2000 at what became known as the Hillside Campsite, where two layers of finds were made. The upper layer had artifacts from the Old Women's Phase, but the lower layers were found to be much older, containing [[Pelican Lake Phase]] remains that were dated to between 1000 and 1500 BC.<ref name=\"milne\"/>\n\n=== Modern founding ===\n[[File:Medicine Hat Station 1906 0664-0001.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian Pacific Railway Station (1906)]]\nIn 1883, when the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) reached Medicine Hat and crossed the river, European Canadians established a town site. They named it from the [[First Nations]] legends. As growth took place, in 1889 Medicine Hat built the first hospital west of [[Winnipeg]]. The CPR established this town as a railway  [[divisional point]]. The frontier settlement was incorporated as a town on October 31, 1898, and as a city on May 9, 1906. Medicine Hat is halfway between Winnipeg and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast.\n\n=== Progress and growth ===\nRich in natural resources including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and was known in its early days as \"the [[Pittsburgh]] of the West\", referring to the industrial city in western Pennsylvania of the United States. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, pottery and glass bottle manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909\u20131914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.\n\nDuring World War II, one of the largest [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s (P.O.W.) in Canada was established here in the mid-1940s, used primarily to hold German and Italian prisoners. It was not until the 1950s of the post-war period that the town again had commercial growth.\n\nIn the 21st century, Medicine Hat promotes its quality of life and affordable cost of living, enjoying the savings of a city-owned gas utility and power generation plant. Major industries have included chemical plants, a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s),<ref>[http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile \"I-XL Industries Acquired by Friends of Medalta in Hope of Preserving Medicine Hat's Industrial Heritage\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709030954/http://medalta.org/friends-medalta-acquire-medicine-hat-brick-tile |date=July 9, 2013 }}</ref> to name a few. Friends of Medalta is a non-profit that has been formed to preserve some of the city's industrial heritage.\n\n[[File:Medicine Hat Teepee at Night, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Teepee at night]]\n[[File:Medicine Hat Speedway Derby, Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Medicine Hat Speedway Derby]]\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Medicine Hat landscape is dominated by the South Saskatchewan River valley. In addition, the tributaries Seven Persons Creek and Ross Creek both flow into the South Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the city. These waterways have cut a dramatic valley landscape with numerous cliffs, and finger [[coulee]]s throughout the city. Beyond the city and river valley, the land is flat to slightly rolling and is characterized by short-grass vegetation.\n\nLocated about {{cvt|40|km}} to the east at {{Coord|50|0|38.2|N|110|6|48.3|W|scale:7500|name=Badlands Guardian}} lies the [[Badlands Guardian|Badlands Guardian Geological Feature]]. It is a landscape formation taking the form of a head wearing a feathered headdress. The head is {{cvt|1000|ft}} wide. It is in inverse relief, formed by valleys rather than raised ground.\n\n===2013 Alberta floods===\nDuring the [[2013 Alberta floods]] Medicine Hat, located on the South Saskatchewan River downstream from the confluence of the [[Bow River|Bow]] and [[Oldman River]]s was hit with significant flooding.<ref name=MedicineHat>{{cite web | url=http://medicinehat.ca/index.aspx?page=1447 | title=Medicine Hat Flood Potential 2013: Current News & Events | publisher=City of Medicine Hat | date=June 21, 2013 | accessdate=June 21, 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021204614/http://www.medicinehat.ca/index.aspx?page=1447 | archivedate=October 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The city evacuated 10,000 residents ahead of the flooding, and facilities including the [[Medicine Hat Arena]] had begun to flood late Sunday evening, June 23.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stephenson |first=Amanda |url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/alberta/Medicine+city+prepares+divided+flood/8567010/story.html |title=Floodwaters expected to cleave Medicine Hat |work=Calgary Herald |date= June 23, 2013 |accessdate= June 23, 2013}}</ref>  The South Saskatchewan River peaked at {{cvt|5,460|m3/s}}, which was below earlier predictions of {{cvt|6,000|m3/s}},<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/24/canada-alberta-flood-medicine-hat-river.html |title=Medicine Hat floodwaters starting to recede |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date= June 24, 2013 |accessdate= June 24, 2013}}</ref> but exceeded the highest recorded rate of {{cvt|5,100|m3/s}} in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/23/alberta-floods-sunday.html |title=Medicine Hat fears rising river after Calgary floods |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date= June 23, 2013 |accessdate= June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\n*Cottonwood \u2013 A community located above the Cottonwood golf course, between the light industrial area and the airport.

He had purchased the land and a team of horses for $40.00 in 1895. The family kept the property for three generations, using part of it as a campground in the early 20th century. In 1930, they built the Maple Leaf motel on the property to generate some income. In 1990 a local family bought the property. With a view toward keeping the prominent property as part of the community, they adapted it as the Saamis Memorial Funeral Chapel & Crematorium.\n\nNow named the ''Saamis Teepee'', this work of public art is the world's tallest [[Tipi|teepee]]. It was installed in 1991 south of the Trans-Canada Highway and at the edge of the Blackfoot [[buffalo jump]], above the Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek. Commissioned for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]] as a symbol of Canada's Plains Indians, it stood {{cvt|215| feet}} high (more than 20 storeys) and is {{cvt|160| feet}} in diameter at the base. The sculpture was designed by Steve Illes of steel and concrete. He had the teepee painted \"white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun, and blue for flowing waters\". Within the teepee are ten circles, with painted illustrations that express ideas about the cultures of the Plains tribes. Explanation are on plaques set in the base.<ref name=\"peters\">[http://hammersonpeters.com/?p=500 \"The Saamis Tepee\"], in ''The Great White North'', Hammerson Peters website</ref>\n\nAlthough designed to withstand extreme temperatures and winds up to {{cvt|240|km/h}}, during a severe windstorm in January 2007, a portion of the teepee was damaged.
