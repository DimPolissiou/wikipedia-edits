Perhaps most significantly, the Apple II was a catalyst for personal computers across many industries; it opened the doors to software marketed at consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Overview==\nIn the May 1977 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''Byte'']], [[Steve Wozniak]] published a detailed description of his design; the article began, \"To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive.\"<ref name=\"wozniak197705\">{{cite news |url = https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1977-05/1977_05_BYTE_02-05_Interfacing#page/n35/mode/2up |title = System Description / The Apple-II |work = BYTE |date = May 1977 |accessdate = October 17, 2013 |last = Wozniak |first = Steve |pages = 34\u201343 }}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II used peculiar engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs, such as:\n\n* Taking advantage of the way the 6502 processor accesses memory: occurs only on alternate phases of the clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused phase avoids memory contention issues and interruptions of the video stream. \n* This arrangement simultaneously eliminated the need for a separate [[Memory refresh|refresh]] circuit for the [[DRAM]] chips, as the video transfer accessed each row of the dynamic memory within the [[Memory refresh#Refresh interval|timeout]] period. In addition, it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video.\n* Rather than use a complex [[analog-to-digital]] circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.\n* A single 14.31818&nbsp;MHz master oscillator (f<sub>M</sub>) was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies, including the microprocessor clock signals (f<sub>M</sub>/14), the video transfer counters, and the color-burst samples (f<sub>M</sub>/4).\n\nThe text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement. For instance, the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory. This complexity was reportedly due to Wozniak's realization that the method would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect (as described above). This method had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and thus can be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for [[subpixel]] font rendering, since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title = The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher = Gibson Research Corporation |last = Gibson |first = Steve |accessdate = August 4, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |archivedate = July 21, 2006  |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II at first used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978, the company introduced an external {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web |title = 5-The Disk II |url = http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |publisher = Apple II History |first = Steven |last = Weyhrich |date = December 28, 2001 |accessdate = November 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |archivedate = December 1, 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Freiberger |first1 = Paul |authorlink1 = Paul Freiberger |first2 = Michael |last2 = Swaine |authorlink2 = Michael Swaine (technical author) |title = Fire In The Valley, Part Two |work = A+ Magazine |type = Book excerpt |date = January 1985 |page = 45 }}</ref>\n\nThe approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM ([[programmable read-only memory]]), he created a functional floppy disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.\n\n==Case design==\nSteve Jobs extensively pushed to give the Apple II a case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists, rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers. The result was a futuristic-looking molded white plastic case. Jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case.\n\nThe first production Apple IIs had hand-molded cases; these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process, which was soon switched to machine molding. In addition, the initial case design had no vent openings, causing high heat buildup from the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] and resulting in the plastic softening and sagging. Apple added vent holes to the case within three months of production; customers with the original case could have them replaced at no charge.appls are free in the store\n\n==PCB revisions==\nThe Apple II's [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6,000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on-screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only 4 colors in hi-res mode, but Wozniak was able to increase this to 6 hi-res colors on later board revisions.\n\nThe PCB had three [[RAM]] banks for a total of 24 RAM chips. Original Apple IIs had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size, and RAM configurations could be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, or 48&nbsp;KiB. The three smallest memory configurations used 4kx1 [[DRAM]]s, with larger ones using 16kx1 DRAMs, or mix of 4-kilobyte and 16-kilobyte banks (the chips in any one bank have to be the same size). The early [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16kx1 chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full 48&nbsp;KiB complement of DRAM.\n\nUnlike most machines, all [[integrated circuit]]s on the Apple II PCB were socketed; although this cost more to manufacture and created the possibility of loose chips causing a system malfunction, it was considered preferable to make servicing and replacement of bad chips easier.\n\nThe Apple II PCB lacks any means of generating an [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]], although expansion cards may generate one. Program code had to stop everything to perform any [[Input/output|I/O]] task; like many of the computer's other idiosyncrasies, this was due to cost reasons and Steve Wozniak assuming interrupts were not needed for gaming or using the computer as a teaching tool.\n\n==Display and graphics==\n{{Main article|Apple II graphics}}\nColor on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the [[NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was added on later by adding a 3.58-megahertz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].\n\nThe Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.\n\nThe coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.\n\nA single HGR page occupied 8&nbsp;KiB of RAM; in practice this meant that the user had to have at least 12&nbsp;KiB of total RAM to use HGR mode and 20&nbsp;KiB to use two pages. Early Apple II games from the 1977 to 79 period often ran only in text or low resolution mode to support users with small memory configurations; HGR not being near universally supported by games until 1980.\n\n==Sound==\nRather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two-, three- and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.\n\n==Programming languages==\nInitially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. Since it only supported integers between -32768 and +32767 (signed 16-bit integer), it was less suitable to business software and Apple soon received complaints from customers. Because Steve Wozniak was too busy developing the Disk II hardware, he did not have time to modify Integer BASIC for floating point support, so Apple instead licensed Microsoft's 6502 BASIC to create [[Applesoft BASIC]]. Disk users normally purchased a so-called Language Card which had Applesoft in ROM and sat below the Integer BASIC ROM in system memory. The user could switch between either BASIC by typing FP or INT at the BASIC prompt. Apple also offered a different version of Applesoft for cassette users which occupied low memory and was started by using the LOAD command in Integer BASIC.\n\nAs shipped, the machine incorporated a \"monitor\" program which supported functions such as displaying and altering the contents of the computer's RAM memory in [[hexadecimal]] format, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This feature enabled hackers to write and debug machine code programs without needing further development software. The computer powered on into the monitor ROM and the user was greeted with a * prompt. From there, he could enter BASIC by typing Ctrl+B, or he could load a machine language program from cassette. Disk software could be booted by typing Ctrl+P followed by 6, referring to Slot 6 which normally contained the Disk II controller.\n\nA 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the [[UCSD]] compiler and operating system for the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16&nbsp;KiB RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48&nbsp;KiB of motherboard memory.\n\n==Manual==\nThe first 1,000 or so Apple IIs shipped in 1977 with a 68-page [[mimeograph]]ed \"Apple II Mini Manual\", hand-bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual,'' which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book. The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the \"Monitor\" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].\n\n==Third-party devices and applications==\nWhen the Apple II initially shipped in June 1977, no expansion cards were available for the slots. This meant that the user did not have any way of connecting a modem or a printer. One popular hack involved connecting a teletype machine to the cassette output.\n\nWozniak's [[open architecture|open-architecture]] design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There were plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]]\u2014such as the [[Z-80 SoftCard]]\u2014that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run programs for the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name=z80>{{cite magazine |magazine = [[InfoWorld]] |date = February 6, 1984 |volume = 6 |issue = 6 |quote = Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II. |page = 64 |title = Review: Premium Softcard IIe |last = Petersen |first = Marty }}</ref> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. The Z80 card also allowed the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, such networks were scarce. But they expanded significantly with the development of bulletin board systems in later years. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that allowed [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. Third-party [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]] greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] doubled or quadrupled the computer's speed.\n\nEarly Apple IIs were often sold with a [[Sup'R'Mod]], which allowed the composite video signal to be viewed on a television.\n\nThe Soviet Union electronics industry designed Apple II mostly compatible computer Agat 7, producing a similar computer known as the [[Agat (computer)|Agat]].

In addition, it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video.\n* Rather than use a complex [[analog-to-digital]] circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.\n* A single 14.31818&nbsp;MHz master oscillator (f<sub>M</sub>) was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies, including the microprocessor clock signals (f<sub>M</sub>/14), the video transfer counters, and the color-burst samples (f<sub>M</sub>/4).\n\nThe text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement. For instance, the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory. This complexity was reportedly due to Wozniak's realization that the method would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect (as described above). This method had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and thus can be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for [[subpixel]] font rendering, since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title = The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher = Gibson Research Corporation |last = Gibson |first = Steve |accessdate = August 4, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |archivedate = July 21, 2006  |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II at first used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978, the company introduced an external {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web |title = 5-The Disk II |url = http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |publisher = Apple II History |first = Steven |last = Weyhrich |date = December 28, 2001 |accessdate = November 16, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |archivedate = December 1, 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Freiberger |first1 = Paul |authorlink1 = Paul Freiberger |first2 = Michael |last2 = Swaine |authorlink2 = Michael Swaine (technical author) |title = Fire In The Valley, Part Two |work = A+ Magazine |type = Book excerpt |date = January 1985 |page = 45 }}</ref>\n\nThe approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM ([[programmable read-only memory]]), he created a functional floppy disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.\n\n==Case design==\nSteve Jobs extensively pushed to give the Apple II a case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists, rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers. The result was a futuristic-looking molded white plastic case. Jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case.\n\nThe first production Apple IIs had hand-molded cases; these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process, which was soon switched to machine molding. In addition, the initial case design had no vent openings, causing high heat buildup from the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] and resulting in the plastic softening and sagging. Apple added vent holes to the case within three months of production; customers with the original case could have them replaced at no charge.\n\n==PCB revisions==\nThe Apple II's [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6,000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on-screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only 4 colors in hi-res mode, but Wozniak was able to increase this to 6 hi-res colors on later board revisions.\n\nThe PCB had three [[RAM]] banks for a total of 24 RAM chips. Original Apple IIs had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size, and RAM configurations could be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, or 48&nbsp;KiB. The three smallest memory configurations used 4kx1 [[DRAM]]s, with larger ones using 16kx1 DRAMs, or mix of 4-kilobyte and 16-kilobyte banks (the chips in any one bank have to be the same size). The early [[Apple II Plus|Apple II+]] models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16kx1 chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full 48&nbsp;KiB complement of DRAM.\n\nUnlike most machines, all [[integrated circuit]]s on the Apple II PCB were socketed; although this cost more to manufacture and created the possibility of loose chips causing a system malfunction, it was considered preferable to make servicing and replacement of bad chips easier.\n\nThe Apple II PCB lacks any means of generating an [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]], although expansion cards may generate one. Program code had to stop everything to perform any [[Input/output|I/O]] task; like many of the computer's other idiosyncrasies, this was due to cost reasons and Steve Wozniak assuming interrupts were not needed for gaming or using the computer as a teaching tool.\n\n==Display and graphics==\n{{Main article|Apple II graphics}}\nColor on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the [[NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was added on later by adding a 3.58-megahertz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].\n\nThe Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.\n\nThe coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.\n\nA single HGR page occupied 8&nbsp;KiB of RAM; in practice this meant that the user had to have at least 12&nbsp;KiB of total RAM to use HGR mode and 20&nbsp;KiB to use two pages. Early Apple II games from the 1977 to 79 period often ran only in text or low resolution mode to support users with small memory configurations; HGR not being near universally supported by games until 1980.\n\n==Sound==\nRather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two-, three- and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.\n\n==Programming languages==\nInitially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. Since it only supported integers between -32768 and +32767 (signed 16-bit integer), it was less suitable to business software and Apple soon received complaints from customers. Because Steve Wozniak was too busy developing the Disk II hardware, he did not have time to modify Integer BASIC for floating point support, so Apple instead licensed Microsoft's 6502 BASIC to create [[Applesoft BASIC]]. Disk users normally purchased a so-called Language Card which had Applesoft in ROM and sat below the Integer BASIC ROM in system memory. The user could switch between either BASIC by typing FP or INT at the BASIC prompt. Apple also offered a different version of Applesoft for cassette users which occupied low memory and was started by using the LOAD command in Integer BASIC.\n\nAs shipped, the machine incorporated a \"monitor\" program which supported functions such as displaying and altering the contents of the computer's RAM memory in [[hexadecimal]] format, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This feature enabled hackers to write and debug machine code programs without needing further development software. The computer powered on into the monitor ROM and the user was greeted with a * prompt. From there, he could enter BASIC by typing Ctrl+B, or he could load a machine language program from cassette. Disk software could be booted by typing Ctrl+P followed by 6, referring to Slot 6 which normally contained the Disk II controller.\n\nA 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the [[UCSD]] compiler and operating system for the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16&nbsp;KiB RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48&nbsp;KiB of motherboard memory.\n\n==Manual==\nThe first 1,000 or so Apple IIs shipped in 1977 with a 68-page [[mimeograph]]ed \"Apple II Mini Manual\", hand-bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual,'' which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book. The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the \"Monitor\" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].\n\n==Third-party devices and applications==\nWhen the Apple II initially shipped in June 1977, no expansion cards were available for the slots. This meant that the user did not have any way of connecting a modem or a printer. One popular hack involved connecting a teletype machine to the cassette output.\n\nWozniak's [[open architecture|open-architecture]] design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There were plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]]\u2014such as the [[Z-80 SoftCard]]\u2014that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run programs for the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name=z80>{{cite magazine |magazine = [[InfoWorld]] |date = February 6, 1984 |volume = 6 |issue = 6 |quote = Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II. |page = 64 |title = Review: Premium Softcard IIe |last = Petersen |first = Marty }}</ref> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. The Z80 card also allowed the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, such networks were scarce.

Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for [[larva]]e. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|commercially]]. The decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.\n\nBees range in size from tiny [[stingless bee]] species whose workers are less than {{convert|2|mm|inch|2}} long, to ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', the largest species of [[Megachilidae|leafcutter bee]], whose females can attain a length of {{convert|39|mm|inch|2}}. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the [[Halictidae]], or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as [[bee-eater]]s; insect predators include [[beewolf|beewolves]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].\n\nHuman [[beekeeping]] or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, [[royal jelly]] and [[propolis]]. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where beekeeping is far more common.\n\nThe analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/26/widespread-losses-of-pollinating-insects-revealed-across-britain |title=Widespread losses of pollinating insects revealed across Britain |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[File:Melittosphex burmensis.jpg|thumb|''[[Melittosphex burmensis]]'', a fossil bee preserved in [[amber]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] (100 to 145 million years ago) of [[Myanmar]]]]\n\nThe ancestors of bees were [[wasp]]s in the family [[Crabronidae]], which were [[Predation|predators]] of other insects.

Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no [[diapause]] stage.<ref name=Roubik1992>{{cite book |author=Roubik, David W. |title=Ecology and Natural History of Tropical Bees |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42909-2 |page=15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617144437/https://books.google.com/books?id=ljlaYMeI6noC |archivedate=17 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The bumblebee lifecycle|url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/|publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust|accessdate=1 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629043439/http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/lifecycle/|archivedate=29 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Learning About Honey Bees |url=http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |publisher=The South Carolina Mid-State Beekeepers Association |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701180422/http://www.scmidstatebeekeepers.org/honeybeelifecycle.htm |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Solitary Bees |url=http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |publisher=National Bee Unit |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701202809/http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/downloadDocument.cfm?id=901 |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end.

They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon. The cocoon is semi-transparent and the pupa can be seen through it.

Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males.

Cottle rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the American multi-platinum R&B vocal group [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]]. Cottle is also known for her marriage to rapper [[T.I.]]. Cottle received a [[Grammy Award]] for her writing contributions on the [[TLC (group)|TLC]] hit \"[[No Scrubs]]\". Cottle acquired the nickname \"Tiny\" due to her small stature of 4'11\".\n\n==Early life and career==\nCottle was born in [[College Park, Georgia]] to a [[European American]] mother, Dianne Cottle (b. 1945) and an [[African American]] father, Charles \"Speedy\" Pope (1936\u20132013). Cottle's father and her uncle, Joseph Pope (1933\u20131996), formed the R&B group [[The Tams]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Zell |title=They Heard Georgia Singing|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1996|pages=285|isbn=0-86554-504-9}}</ref> Cottle joined the R&B [[quartet]] [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] in 1992 while attending Tri-Cities Performing Arts High School. Xscape was discovered by producer [[Jermaine Dupri]] while singing at his birthday celebration in [[Atlanta]]. Dupri immediately signed the group to his then new record label, [[So So Def|So So Def Recordings]].\n\nAs a member of the group, Cottle has contributed to three of the band's platinum albums: ''[[Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha]]'', ''[[Off the Hook (Xscape album)|Off the Hook]]'', and ''[[Traces of My Lipstick]]''. As a member of Xscape, she has received two [[Soul Train Music Awards]] for Best New R&B Artist and Best R&B Album and the A-Town Music Award for Best Duo/Group. Cottle sang lead vocals on six of Xscape's hit singles: \"[[Understanding (song)|Understanding]]\", \"Do You Want To?\", \"All I Need\", \"Love's a Funny Thing\", \"My Little Secret\",  and \"Am I Dreamin'\". She has also recorded on soundtracks for ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'', ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', and ''[[Love Jones (film)|Love Jones]]''. In 1998, after the release of Xscape's third album, ''Traces of My Lipstick'', the band parted ways.\n\nIn 2000, Cottle and fellow former Xscape group member [[Kandi Burruss]] were honored with a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best R&B Song]] for penning [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s hit single \"[[No Scrubs]]\". Cottle's other accomplishments include an [[ASCAP|American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] award in the R&B and Pop Music categories for \"No Scrubs\", as well as the ASCAP Rap Award for her work on the [[Sporty Thievz]] track \"[[No Pigeons]]\". Cottle has also worked with [[T.I.]], [[8Ball & MJG]], [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]].\n\nAfter a five-year hiatus, Cottle reunited with sisters LaTocha and Tamika Scott and added a new member, Kiesha Miles, to release a Xscape album entitled ''Unchained'' and released the single \"What's Up\" in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200503&listid=01|title=Xscape Breaks the Chains|last=Boston |first=Ericka |author2=Terrell, Calvin |publisher=s2smagazine.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311195711/http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200503&listid=01|archivedate=11 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nCottle is involved in a project with Kiesha Miles called the [[OMG Girlz]].

Cottle rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the American multi-platinum R&B vocal group [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]]. Cottle is also known for her marriage to rapper [[T.I.]]. Cottle received a [[Grammy Award]] for her writing contributions on the [[TLC (group)|TLC]] hit \"[[No Scrubs]]\". Cottle acquired the nickname \"Tiny\" due to her small stature of 4'11\".\n\n==Early life and career==\nCottle was born in [[College Park, Georgia]] to a [[European American]] mother, Dianne Cottle (b. 1945) and an [[African American]] father, Charles \"Speedy\" Pope (1936\u20132013). Cottle's father and her uncle, Joseph Pope (1933\u20131996), formed the R&B group [[The Tams]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Zell |title=They Heard Georgia Singing|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1996|pages=285|isbn=0-86554-504-9}}</ref> Cottle joined the R&B [[quartet]] [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]] in 1992 while attending Tri-Cities Performing Arts High School. Xscape was discovered by producer [[Jermaine Dupri]] while singing at his birthday celebration in [[Atlanta]]. Dupri immediately signed the group to his then new record label, [[So So Def|So So Def Recordings]].\n\nAs a member of the group, Cottle has contributed to three of the band's platinum albums: ''[[Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha]]'', ''[[Off the Hook (Xscape album)|Off the Hook]]'', and ''[[Traces of My Lipstick]]''. As a member of Xscape, she has received two [[Soul Train Music Awards]] for Best New R&B Artist and Best R&B Album and the A-Town Music Award for Best Duo/Group. Cottle sang lead vocals on six of Xscape's hit singles: \"[[Understanding (song)|Understanding]]\", \"Do You Want To?\", \"All I Need\", \"Love's a Funny Thing\", \"My Little Secret\",  and \"Am I Dreamin'\". She has also recorded on soundtracks for ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'', ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', and ''[[Love Jones (film)|Love Jones]]''. In 1998, after the release of Xscape's third album, ''Traces of My Lipstick'', the band parted ways.\n\nIn 2000, Cottle and fellow former Xscape group member [[Kandi Burruss]] were honored with a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best R&B Song]] for penning [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s hit single \"[[No Scrubs]]\". Cottle's other accomplishments include an [[ASCAP|American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] award in the R&B and Pop Music categories for \"No Scrubs\", as well as the ASCAP Rap Award for her work on the [[Sporty Thievz]] track \"[[No Pigeons]]\". Cottle has also worked with [[T.I.]], [[8Ball & MJG]], [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]].\n\nAfter a five-year hiatus, Cottle reunited with sisters LaTocha and Tamika Scott and added a new member, Kiesha Miles, to release a Xscape album entitled ''Unchained'' and released the single \"What's Up\" in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200503&listid=01|title=Xscape Breaks the Chains|last=Boston |first=Ericka |author2=Terrell, Calvin |publisher=s2smagazine.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311195711/http://www.s2smagazine.com/content/content.asp?issueid=200503&listid=01|archivedate=11 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nCottle is involved in a project with Kiesha Miles called the [[OMG Girlz]].

It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], a creation of [[Doctor Eggman]]'s grandfather, [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog video game characters#Professor Gerald Robotnik|Professor Gerald Robotnik]], as he attempts to learn about his past while suffering from [[amnesia]]. ''Shadow the Hedgehog'' introduces [[third-person shooter]] elements and [[nonlinear gameplay]] to the ''Sonic'' franchise. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks, and most levels have three possible missions that the player may choose to complete. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels.\n\nThe development team wanted to make a game featuring Shadow to capitalize on the character's popularity and resolve plot mysteries that began with his introduction in ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. Director [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]], who targeted a younger audience with previous ''Sonic'' games, strove to attract an older audience with ''Shadow the Hedgehog''; Shadow's character also allowed the team to use elements otherwise inappropriate for the series. The game was revealed at the March 2005 [[Walk of Game]] event, and it was released for the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in November 2005.\n\n''Shadow the Hedgehog'' received generally unfavorable reviews<!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO \"MIXED\" AS THIS IS NOT WHAT METACRITIC SAYS. Thank you. --> from critics, who criticized its mature themes, level design, and addition of guns and other weapons to traditional ''Sonic'' gameplay. However, some praised its [[replay value]]. The game was commercially successful, selling 2.06 million copies by March 2007.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Shadow the Hedgehog'' is a [[platform game]] that incorporates elements of [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] gameplay. Like previous games in the ''Sonic'' series, basic gameplay involves running quickly, collecting [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Rings|rings]], and destroying enemies.<ref name=\"GSPS2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/shadowthehedgehog/review.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202035043/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/shadowthehedgehog/review.html|archivedate=2 February 2009 |title=''Shadow the Hedgehog'' for PS2 Review|website=GameSpot|date=November 21, 2005|accessdate=January 26, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"1UP PS2\">{{cite web |last=Sewart |first=Greg |date=January 12, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U6mYaVqw?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20121108105236/http://www.1up.com/reviews/shadow-the-hedgehog |archivedate=15 November 2014 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3146953&p=2&sec=REVIEWS |title=Reviews: Shadow the Hedgehog for PS2 |website=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shadow collects rings as a form of health; when he is attacked by an enemy, ten of his rings bounce away from him in all directions.

Robotnik was trying to unlock the secrets of eternal life on the government's orders and create the \"Ultimate Life Form.\" To that end, Robotnik designed Shadow to harness the powers of the Chaos Emeralds.

Commander, who holds a grudge against Shadow. When completing \"Hero\" missions, Shadow usually helps G.U.N. and heroic characters from the ''Sonic'' series, including [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], [[Amy Rose|Amy]], [[Rouge the Bat|Rouge]], [[E-123 Omega|Omega]], [[Vector the Crocodile|Vector]],<ref name=\"profiles\"/> [[Charmy Bee|Charmy]], and [[Espio the Chameleon|Espio]].<ref name=\"espio\">{{cite video game|quote='''Espio:''' Damn!

''Shadow the Hedgehog'' introduces [[third-person shooter]] elements and [[nonlinear gameplay]] to the ''Sonic'' franchise. To defeat enemies, Shadow can use various weapons and special attacks, and most levels have three possible missions that the player may choose to complete. The missions completed determine the game's plot and subsequently playable levels.\n\nThe development team wanted to make a game featuring Shadow to capitalize on the character's popularity and resolve plot mysteries that began with his introduction in ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. Director [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]], who targeted a younger audience with previous ''Sonic'' games, strove to attract an older audience with ''Shadow the Hedgehog''; Shadow's character also allowed the team to use elements otherwise inappropriate for the series. The game was revealed at the March 2005 [[Walk of Game]] event, and it was released for the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in November 2005.\n\n''Shadow the Hedgehog'' received generally unfavorable reviews<!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO \"MIXED\" AS THIS IS NOT WHAT METACRITIC SAYS. Thank you. --> from critics, who criticized its mature themes, level design, and addition of guns and other weapons to traditional ''Sonic'' gameplay. However, some praised its [[replay value]]. The game was commercially successful, selling 2.06 million copies by March 2007.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Shadow the Hedgehog'' is a [[platform game]] that incorporates elements of [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] gameplay.

Robotnik was trying to unlock the secrets of eternal life on the government's orders and create the \"Ultimate Life Form.\" To that end, Robotnik designed Shadow to harness the powers of the Chaos Emeralds. At the end of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', his first in-game appearance,<ref name=\"press_release\"/> Shadow was presumed dead, but he returned in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'' with [[amnesia]] that persists into the events of ''Shadow the Hedgehog''.<ref name=\"gtreview\"/><ref name=\"allgame\"/>\n\nThe Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) is the military of Earth's government, the United Federation, and it is directed by the G.U.N. Commander, who holds a grudge against Shadow. When completing \"Hero\" missions, Shadow usually helps G.U.N. and heroic characters from the ''Sonic'' series, including [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], [[Amy Rose|Amy]], [[Rouge the Bat|Rouge]], [[E-123 Omega|Omega]], [[Vector the Crocodile|Vector]],<ref name=\"profiles\"/> [[Charmy Bee|Charmy]], and [[Espio the Chameleon|Espio]].<ref name=\"espio\">{{cite video game|quote='''Espio:''' Damn!

Black Doom, the leader of the Black Arms, sends an extension of himself called \"Doom's Eye\" to watch Shadow and help him complete missions. When completing \"Dark\" missions, Shadow helps either Black Doom or Doctor Eggman, each of whom wants the Chaos Emeralds for himself.
