In the  Fermi transition, the spins of the emitted particles are antiparallel, coupling to <math>S=0</math>, so the angular momentum of the initial and final angular momentum states of the nucleus are unchanged (<math>\\Delta J=0</math>).  This is in contrast to a Gamow-Teller transition,  where the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and antineutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin <math>S=1</math>, leading to an angular momentum change <math>\\Delta J = 0,\\pm 1</math> between the initial and final angular momentum states of the nucleus.\n \nFermi and Gamow-Teller transitions correspond to two different forms of leading order behavior of the weak interaction Hamiltonian in the non-relativistic limit:\n<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Samuel S.M.

In \u03b1 decay the nucleons of the original nucleus are used to form the final state \u03b1 particle (<sup>4</sup>He).  In \u03b2 decay the \u03b2 and neutrino particles are the result of a nucleon transformation into its isospin complement ({{nowrap|n \u2192 p}} or {{nowrap|p \u2192 n}}).  Below is a list of the differences:\n\n#The \u03b2 electron and neutrino did not exist before the decay.\n#The \u03b2 electron and neutrino are relativistic (nuclear decay energy is usually not enough to make heavy \u03b1 nucleus relativistic).\n#The light decay products can have continuous energy distributions. (before assuming the \u03b1 carried away most of the energy was usually \na good approximation).\n\nThe \u03b2 decay rate calculation was developed by Fermi in 1934 and was based on Pauli's neutrino hypothesis.\n\n[[Fermi's Golden Rule]] says that the transition rate <math>W</math> is given by a transition matrix element (or \"amplitude\") <math>M_{i,f}</math> weighted by the phase space and Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math> such that\n\n: <math>W = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\hbar} \\left| M_{i,f} \\right|^2 \\times \\text{(Phase Space)} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}</math>\n\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that the Gamow\u2013Teller nuclear transition from  0 \u2192 \u00b11 is a weak perturbation of the system's interaction [[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]]. This assumption appears to be true based on the very short time scale (10<sup>\u221220</sup> s) it takes for the formation of quasi-stationary nuclear states compared with the time it takes for a \u03b2 decay (half lives ranging from seconds to days).\n\nThe matrix element between parent and daughter nuclei in such a transition is:\n\n<math>\\left| M_{i,f} \\right|^2 = \\left\\langle \\psi_\\text{Daughter} \\phi_\\beta \\psi_\\nu \\right| \\hat{H}_\\text{int} \\left| \\psi_\\text{Parent} \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwith the interaction Hamiltonian forming 2 separate states from the perturbation.\n<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Samuel S.M.

In \u03b1 decay the nucleons of the original nucleus are used to form the final state \u03b1 particle (<sup>4</sup>He).  In \u03b2 decay the \u03b2 and neutrino particles are the result of a nucleon transformation into its isospin complement ({{nowrap|n \u2192 p}} or {{nowrap|p \u2192 n}}).  Below is a list of the differences:\n\n#The \u03b2 electron and neutrino did not exist before the decay.\n#The \u03b2 electron and neutrino are relativistic (nuclear decay energy is usually not enough to make heavy \u03b1 nucleus relativistic).\n#The light decay products can have continuous energy distributions. (before assuming the \u03b1 carried away most of the energy was usually \na good approximation).\n\nThe \u03b2 decay rate calculation was developed by Fermi in 1934 and was based on Pauli's neutrino hypothesis.\n\n[[Fermi's Golden Rule]] says that the transition rate <math>W</math> is given by a transition matrix element (or \"amplitude\") <math>M_{i,f}</math> weighted by the phase space and Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math> such that\n\n: <math>W = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\hbar} \\left| M_{i,f} \\right|^2 \\times \\text{(Phase Space)} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}</math>\n\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that the Gamow\u2013Teller nuclear transition from  0 \u2192 \u00b11 is a weak perturbation of the system's interaction [[Hamiltonian mechanics#Mathematical formalism|Hamiltonian]]. This assumption appears to be true based on the very short time scale (10<sup>\u221220</sup> s) it takes for the formation of quasi-stationary nuclear states compared with the time it takes for a \u03b2 decay (half lives ranging from seconds to days).\n\nThe matrix element between parent and daughter nuclei in such a transition is:\n\n<math>\\left| M_{i,f} \\right|^2 = \\left\\langle \\psi_\\text{Daughter} \\phi_\\beta \\psi_\\nu \\right| \\hat{H}_\\text{int} \\left| \\psi_\\text{Parent} \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwith the interaction Hamiltonian forming 2 separate states from the perturbation.\n<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Samuel S.M.

The film stars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Emma Thompson]]. The main plot follows Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS worker who begins hearing a disembodied voice narrating his life as it happens \u2013 seemingly the text of a novel in which it is stated that he, the main character, will soon die \u2013 and he frantically seeks to somehow prevent that ending. The film was shot on location in [[Chicago]], and has been praised for its innovative, intelligent story and fine performances. Ferrell, who came to prominence playing brash comedic parts, garnered particular attention for offering a restrained performance in his first starring dramatic role.\n\n''Stranger than Fiction'' was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on November 10, 2006. Upon release, the film received positive reviews mainly for its themes, humor, and performances.\n\n==Plot==\nHarold Crick, an [[agent (law)|agent]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service]], is a lonely man who lives his life by his wristwatch. He is assigned to audit an [[tax resistance|intentionally tax-delinquent]] baker, Ana Pascal, to whom he is attracted. On the same day, he begins hearing the voice of a woman [[omniscience|omnisciently]] narrating his life as if he were a [[Protagonist|main character]] in a novel, but is unable to communicate with it. Harold's watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates, \"little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\". Worried by this prediction, Harold consults a [[psychiatrist]] who attributes the voice to [[schizophrenia]], though they consider that, if there really is a narrator, he should visit an expert in literature. Crick visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor, and relates his story. When Jules recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold's story, he encourages Harold to identify the author, first by determining if the work is a comedy or tragedy.\n\nAs Harold audits Ana, the two fall for each other. When Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him because they could be viewed as a bribe, Ana tells him to leave, making Harold believe his story is a tragedy. On the advice of Jules, Harold spends the next day at home trying to control his destiny by doing nothing, but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew that mistook the building for an abandoned one. Jules believes that since Harold cannot control the plot, he should accept his impending death and enjoy whatever time he has left. Harold takes a vacation from work, develops his friendship with his co-worker Dave, fulfills his dream of learning to play the guitar, and apologizes to Ana and begins dating her. Harold reassesses his story as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation, Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as author Karen Eiffel. Jules, an admirer of Karen's work, reveals that all of her books feature the main character's tragic death.\n\nKaren struggles from [[writer's block]] and researches ways to kill the character Harold to complete her next book. Her publisher sends an assistant, Penny Escher, to ensure the book is completed. Harold finds Karen through her tax records. When Karen learns that Harold experiences everything she writes, she is horrified by the thought that her books may have killed real people. She tells Harold she wrote a draft of his death, but has not typed it up yet; the events in the book manifest when she strikes the period key. Penny suggests Harold read the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold cannot bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules confirms its excellence, labeling it as Karen's masterpiece; Harold's death is integral to its genius. Though Harold is distressed over his fate, Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death: this one death, at least, will have a deeper meaning. Harold reads the manuscript, then returns it to Karen, telling her the death she has written for him is \"beautiful\" and she should keep it intact. He spends one last night with Ana.\n\nThe next day, Harold prepares to return to work, despite Karen's voice narrating as she types up her ending. Because Harold's watch is three minutes fast owing to the imprecise time given to him weeks earlier, he reaches the bus stop early and watches as a young boy falls in front of the oncoming bus. Karen continues writing; Harold leaps from the curb and pushes the child out of the way, but is struck by the bus instead. Karen cannot complete the sentence confirming Harold's death, and Harold wakes up in a hospital, injured but alive. He learns that fragments of his wristwatch blocked the right [[ulnar artery]] in his body after the collision, saving his life. \n\nWhen Jules reads Karen's final manuscript, he notes that the story is weaker without Harold's death. Karen admits the flaw, but points out that the story was meant to be about a man who dies unexpectedly; with Harold sacrificing himself, knowing he could have prevented his death, the story would have lost its tragic impact. In place of Harold, his wristwatch\u2014[[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] throughout the entire film\u2014is the character who died tragically.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Will Ferrell]] as Harold Crick, an IRS agent who starts hearing Eiffel's voice narrating his life.\n*[[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Ana Pascal, a local baker who goes up against any kinds of governmental taxes but falls in love with Crick.\n*[[Emma Thompson]] as Karen Eiffel, a partially depressed author known for killing her main protagonists in her novels, but ends up writing a novel named \"Death and Taxes\" about Harold's life.\n*[[Dustin Hoffman]] as Professor Jules Hilbert, a literature expert advising Crick.\n*[[Queen Latifah]] as Penny Escher, a secretary who helps authors to finish their works.\n*[[Tony Hale]] as Dave, Harold's friend from his work.\n*[[Tom Hulce]] as Dr. Cayly\n*[[Linda Hunt]] as Dr. Mittag-Leffler, a psychologist whom Crick sees in hopes of solving his narration problem.\n*[[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Book Channel host\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nIn 2001, writer [[Zach Helm]] was working with producer Clarence Helmus on a project they called \"The Disassociate\".<ref>Lindsey Doran, \"Words on a Page\" bonus featurette on DVD</ref> Helm came to Doran with a new idea involving a man who finds himself accompanied by a narrator that only he can hear. Helm next decided that the narrator should state that the man is going to die because, as Helm described, \"there's something very poetic about the understanding of one's place in the universe, but it's far more dramatic when such understanding occurs only days before that life ends.\" Helm and Doran began referring to the new project as \"The Narrator Project\" and developed the story through a process of Helm's bringing ideas and Doran's asking questions. One of Helm's main ideas involved engaging the movie's form as much as its content.<ref name=\"this original URL\">SONY Pictures Entertainment (2006).

C. Escher|Escher]], and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. When the character of Dr. Hilbert tells Harold that he has devised a series of 23 questions in order to investigate the narrator, it is a playful reference to [[Hilbert's 23 problems]]. The film's title derives from a quote by Lord Byron: \"Tis strange\u2014but true; for truth is always strange, Stranger than fiction\".<ref>1823, Don Juan: Cantos XIII, XIII, and XIV, George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron), Canto 14, Stanza 101, Quote Page 165, Printed for John Hunt, London.</ref>\n\nAccording to Helm, one of the film's major themes is of interconnectivity. Helm stated \"Each of these characters ends up doing little things to save one another. There's an underlying theme that the things we take most for granted are often the ones that make life worth living and actually keep us alive.\"<ref name=\"this original URL\"/>\n\n===Photography===\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago, Illinois.

Helm next decided that the narrator should state that the man is going to die because, as Helm described, \"there's something very poetic about the understanding of one's place in the universe, but it's far more dramatic when such understanding occurs only days before that life ends.\" Helm and Doran began referring to the new project as \"The Narrator Project\" and developed the story through a process of Helm's bringing ideas and Doran's asking questions. One of Helm's main ideas involved engaging the movie's form as much as its content.<ref name=\"this original URL\">SONY Pictures Entertainment (2006).

C. Escher|Escher]], and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. When the character of Dr. Hilbert tells Harold that he has devised a series of 23 questions in order to investigate the narrator, it is a playful reference to [[Hilbert's 23 problems]]. The film's title derives from a quote by Lord Byron: \"Tis strange\u2014but true; for truth is always strange, Stranger than fiction\".<ref>1823, Don Juan: Cantos XIII, XIII, and XIV, George Gordon Byron (Lord Byron), Canto 14, Stanza 101, Quote Page 165, Printed for John Hunt, London.</ref>\n\nAccording to Helm, one of the film's major themes is of interconnectivity. Helm stated \"Each of these characters ends up doing little things to save one another. There's an underlying theme that the things we take most for granted are often the ones that make life worth living and actually keep us alive.\"<ref name=\"this original URL\"/>\n\n===Photography===\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago, Illinois.

When the player has collected enough winged light, their cape level goes up, increasing their maximum \"wing energy\" and allowing them to fly farther. \n\n''Sky: Children of the Light'' features a heavy focus on social mechanics.
