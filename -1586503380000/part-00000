It is located  {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city, along the [[North Saskatchewan River]]. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

This gate provided access to the river.\"]]\nPrior to [[History of Canada|colonization]], the area around what is now Fort Saskatchewan was a gathering place and home to a variety of different [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous]] nations, including the [[Cree|Cree (N\u00e9hinaw)]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Nakota]] nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskatchewanrecord.com/news/local-news/here-is-a-sneak-peek|title=Here is a sneak peek|last=January 31|first=Arthur Green Published on:|last2=January 31|first2=2019 {{!}} Last Updated:|date=2019-01-31|website=Fort Saskatchewan Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=Est|first3=2019 4:20 Pm}}</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the region commonly traveled the North Saskatchewan River by [[Canoe]].

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison. The community was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1899, a [[town]] in 1904, and a [[city]] in 1985.<ref name=\"AMACityProfiles\" />\n=== Arrival of the railway ===\n[[File:CNR Station Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=CN Station in Fort Saskatchewan.|left|thumb|300px|Historic [[Fort Saskatchewan station|Fort Saskatchewan railway station]]]]\nPrior to the arrival of the railway, people travelling to and from Edmonton had to traverse a dirt trail that wound around woods and swamps.<ref name=\":1\" /> The [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (C.N.R.) reached Fort Saskatchewan in 1905, placing the town on a transcontinental rail line.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=337}}</ref> The [[Fort Saskatchewan station|C.N.R. station]] is a modified third class station design (100-19 plan), which is a \"special station\" that was only used by C.N.R. at the most significant stops along their line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Details.aspx?DeptID=1&ObjectID=4665-0701|title=Alberta Register of Historic Places|website=hermis.alberta.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> It is longer than other third class stations built by C.N.R. and has several unique features, including hip roofs on either side of the building, and a large interior that contains a vestibule, a kitchen, a living room, a large general waiting room, a separate waiting room for women, an office, and a small freight shed. An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]].

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

Useful Music songs were featured in many of the top rated shows of the time, including [[Party of Five]], [[Dawson's Creek]], [[Northern Exposure]], and Camera One was a feature of an episode of the comedy series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (season 1, episode 7, \"[[My Super Ego]]\").  \n\nJosh Joplin Group toured America, Mexico, Canada, Australia, and all of Europe.

On this record, Joplin's lyrics were noticeably more clever and playful than on ''Useful Music,'' with subject matter including the nature of popularity (\"The Wonderful Ones\"), the absurdity of snobbery among music lovers (\"It's Only Entertainment\"), and the uselessness of trying to predict the future (\"The Future That Was\").

Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in [[cognitive bias|reasoning]] ([[representativeness heuristic]], [[base rate fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]]), [[attention]] ([[automaticity]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]) and [[memory]] (schemas, [[primacy effect|primacy and recency]]). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more [[cognitive]] than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as [[belief]]s and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by [[behaviorism]].<ref name=\"Fiske\">{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |url=https://archive.org/details/socialcognition0002fisk|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]], Inc.|year=1991}}</ref>\n\nOne notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see [[attribution theory]]).<ref name=\"Fiske\"/> It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as [[social identity theory]] and [[social representations]] may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a \"coherent integrated whole\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] Ltd|year=2006|location=London}}</ref> A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed [[motor cognition]], which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.\n\n==Social schemas==\nSocial schema theory builds on and uses terminology from [[schema theory]] in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or \"[[concept]]s\" are [[representation (psychology)|represented in the mind]] and how they are [[categorized]]. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is \"activated\" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a \"teacher schema\" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.\n\nWhen a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and [[behavior]] toward the female group member.<ref name=\"Fiske\"/> Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.\n\nSocial cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication?

After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a [[confirmation bias]]. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.\n\nSocial cognition researchers are also interested in the [[regulation]] of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the [[social norms]] of the situation in which case an individual is [[motivate]]d to [[social inhibition|inhibit]] the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and [[social behavior]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Cultural differences==\nSocial psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.<ref name= \"Aronson\">{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010}}</ref> Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing.

One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the US as they contain more objects which compete for attention.

A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in [[cognitive bias|reasoning]] ([[representativeness heuristic]], [[base rate fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]]), [[attention]] ([[automaticity]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]) and [[memory]] (schemas, [[primacy effect|primacy and recency]]). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more [[cognitive]] than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as [[belief]]s and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by [[behaviorism]].<ref name=\"Fiske\">{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |url=https://archive.org/details/socialcognition0002fisk|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]], Inc.|year=1991}}</ref>\n\nOne notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see [[attribution theory]]).<ref name=\"Fiske\"/> It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as [[social identity theory]] and [[social representations]] may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a \"coherent integrated whole\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] Ltd|year=2006|location=London}}</ref> A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed [[motor cognition]], which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.\n\n==Social schemas==\nSocial schema theory builds on and uses terminology from [[schema theory]] in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or \"[[concept]]s\" are [[representation (psychology)|represented in the mind]] and how they are [[categorized]]. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is \"activated\" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a \"teacher schema\" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.\n\nWhen a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and [[behavior]] toward the female group member.<ref name=\"Fiske\"/> Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.\n\nSocial cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication?

After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a [[confirmation bias]]. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.\n\nSocial cognition researchers are also interested in the [[regulation]] of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the [[social norms]] of the situation in which case an individual is [[motivate]]d to [[social inhibition|inhibit]] the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and [[social behavior]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Cultural differences==\nSocial psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.<ref name= \"Aronson\">{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010}}</ref> Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing.
