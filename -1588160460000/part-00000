The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like [[National Order Party]], [[National Salvation Party]] and [[Welfare Party]]. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary [[conservatism|conservative party]] following the example of the European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.\n\nWhen the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of [[Necmettin Erbakan]] founded the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) and the reformers founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) under the leadership of [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] and Erdo\u011fan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like [[Ali Babacan]] and [[Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu]]), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program.

Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system. As part of the reforms, the \"Green Card\" program, which provides health benefits to the poor, was expanded in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Transforming Turkey's Health System \u2014 Lessons for Universal Coverage|volume=373|issue=14|pages=1285\u20131289|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1410433|pmid=26422719|year=2015|last1=Atun|first1=Rifat|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/042e12de1c2f9da048a14f5d0216cfff59e9a6e1}}</ref> The reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state-run healthcare, which, along with long queues in state-run hospitals, resulted in the rise of private medical care in Turkey, forcing state-run hospitals to compete by increasing quality.\n\nIn April 2006, Erdo\u011fan unveiled a social security reform package demanded by the [[International Monetary Fund]] under a loan deal. The move, which Erdo\u011fan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=19 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places.

Within his [[Virtue Party]], there was a dispute about the appropriate discourse of the party between traditional politicians and pro-reform politicians. The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like [[National Order Party]], [[National Salvation Party]] and [[Welfare Party]]. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary [[conservatism|conservative party]] following the example of the European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.\n\nWhen the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of [[Necmettin Erbakan]] founded the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) and the reformers founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) under the leadership of [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] and Erdo\u011fan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like [[Ali Babacan]] and [[Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu]]), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program.

Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system.

The move, which Erdo\u011fan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=19 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places.

The Iraiina are just one of the many Sun People Tribes. As a gift, the Iraiina chief gives Marian a slave, Swindapa, a captured female \"Earth People\" warrior.

The ''Eagle'' leaves for Nantucket but takes with them Isketerol, a [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] merchant who hopes to learn from the Americans.\n\nWhile the people of Nantucket work for their survival, the ambitious and ruthless Lieutenant William Walker of the USCGC ''Eagle'' decides that with modern technology he could become a king in this time. With the help of Isketerol and others, Walker convinces some naive environmentalists to steal a ship and kidnap Cofflin's wife so they can give the benefits of modern culture to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s. Meanwhile, Walker and Isketerol steal another ship and return to Britain to recruit soldiers for their eventual takeover of [[Helladic period|Greece]]. Marian decides to rescue Cofflin's wife first and saves her after defeating an [[Olmec]] army. The bloodthirsty Olmecs proceed to gruesomely kill the modern Americans who sought to help them.\n\nTime passes as Walker solidifies his control over the Sun People and Nantucket creates a new government and prepares to take down Walker. Marian returns to Britain with a small army and uses Swindapa, who has become her lover, to convince the Earth People to fight with them to defeat Walker.

He was educated at St. James College in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], [[Maryland]]. He moved with his family to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1857. In 1862, Clarkson married Mary Beecher Matteson; they had five children. In 1833, Clarkson's father, an enterprising Gettysburg businessman, purchased a tract of land along the Chambersburg Pike, and built a stone house that in 1863 was used as headquarters of General [[Robert E. Lee]] during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Clarkson's father found himself in financial difficulty and the house was sold at a sheriff's auction in 1846 to [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. Michael Clarkson and Stevens were close friends and Stevens wrote a letter to [[President Abraham Lincoln]] on February 9, 1863 recommending a commission for Thaddeus to a commission in the Regular Army; the commission was apparently never granted as Thaddeus remained an officer in the volunteer service.\n\n==Military career==\nOn April 16, 1861, Clarkson enlisted at Chicago as a private in Smith's Independent Illinois Light Artillery. He was promoted to corporal on May 2, 1861 and to sergeant on July 16, 1861; he mustered out with the battery on the same date.
