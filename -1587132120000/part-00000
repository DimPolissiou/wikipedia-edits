{"title_page": "Sports in North America", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=September 2017}}\n\nThere is a wide variety of organized sports in the continent of North America. The continent is the birthplace of several of these organized sports, such as [[basketball]], [[gridiron football]] (including both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football|Canadian]] games), [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[racquetball]], [[rodeo]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]]. The modern versions of [[baseball]] and [[softball]], [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[stock car racing]], and [[surfing]] also developed in North America.\n\nSports leagues in Canada and the United States use a closed, franchise model which has the same teams playing every year, with occasional additions of [[expansion team]]s or [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocations of existing teams]]. Leagues in other North American countries use [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance at the end of each season.\n\nThe [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] dominate organized men's professional team sports in those two countries: [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). [[Liga MX]], the top-level Association football in Mexico is also widely popular. In the [[Caribbean]], where [[Cricket in the West Indies|cricket is popular]], that region's major domestic competitions include the [[Regional Four Day Competition]], the [[Regional Super50]], and the [[Caribbean Premier League]].\n\n[[Major women's sport leagues in North America|Women's professional sports]] in the U.S. and Canada include the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and the [[National Women's Hockey League]]. Individual professional sports organizations based in North America include [[INDYCAR]] and [[NASCAR]] in [[auto racing]], the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[LPGA Tour]] in golf, and the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA). [[College athletics]] in Canada are organized by [[U Sports]] and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). In the U.S., they are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA).\n\n==Franchise organization in the U.S. and Canada==\n{{main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Promotion and relegation#United States and Canada}}\n\nA distinct feature in American and Canadian professional sports leagues, compared to many other countries around the world, is the lack of [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two levels based on their performance for the completed [[Season (sports)|season]]. Other North American countries, such as the [[Mexican football league system|Mexico's football league system]], may have a promotion and relegation process, where, for example, teams may transfer between the Mexican top level [[Liga MX]] and the second level [[Ascenso MX]].\n\nInstead, professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada use a closed, franchise model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]], and with no team movement between the top level, the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]]s, and the lower levels, the [[minor league]]s. The minor league system then can be generally viewed as an informal relegation system based on ''individual players'' rather than teams. Many minor league teams are generally affiliated with major league teams. Players remain employees of, or under contract to, the parent organization and are assigned to the minor league level appropriate to their skill and development. Skillful players are often promoted, or 'called up', to the parent major league team while under-performing players or players recovering from a major injury are 'sent down' to an affiliated minor league team.\n\n[[College athletics]] act as the primary suppliers of players to the professional leagues. Many [[College athletics in the United States|college sports in the U.S.]] are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] for large schools, [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] for smaller schools, and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] for schools who do not offer any [[athletic scholarship]] to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by [[U Sports]] for universities and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] for colleges. The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) has members in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\n==Team sports==\n===Football===\n{{see also|Football#North American football codes}}\nNorth America is the birthplace of [[gridiron football]], the form of [[football]] that originally developed, and is primarily played, in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Britannica-Gridiron\">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football | title=Gridiron football | publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Both major forms, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], developed in the late 19th century out of the original games now known as [[rugby football]] and [[association football]].

The NCAA further divides its Division I football teams into the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]. The Football Bowl Subdivision has the largest and most competitive schools, and is noted for its system of postseason [[bowl game]]s.\n\n[[USA Football]] is the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for amateur American football in the U.S., and is a member of the [[International Federation of American Football]] (IFAF), the international governing body of American football associations.

Teams from Canadian universities compete in [[U Sports football]]. The [[Canadian Junior Football League]] and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] field teams with players aged 18\u201322.\n\n[[Football Canada]] is the governing body for amateur Canadian football. Although it primarily focuses on the Canadian form of the game, it is also a member of the International Federation of American Football.\n\n====Association football====\n[[CONCACAF]] is the continental governing body for association football in North America, and runs two visible tournaments: the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] and the Champions League <ref name=\"concacaf.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.concacaf.com/concacaf|title=CONCACAF|work=CONCACAF}}</ref> The Gold Cup is competed every two years among the [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] to determine the regional champion of North America.

This Mexican league system uses [[promotion and relegation]], where teams are transferred between levels based on their final records at the end of the season. For women, the [[Super Liga Femenil de F\u00fatbol]] is at the top level.\n\nThe men's professional soccer league systems in both [[United States soccer league system|the U.S.]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]] instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the the [[USL Championship]]. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: [[League1 Ontario]] and [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]], as well as a separate level-one league, the [[Canadian Premier League]]. The United States has the [[USL League One]] and [[National Independent Soccer Association]], which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] is at the top level, and [[United Women's Soccer]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] are at the second level. [[College soccer]] is played both in the U.S. and Canada, with top players often going on to play professional.\n\nOther countries with multi-level professional league systems include [[Football in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Football in El Salvador#League System|El Salvador]], [[Football in Guatemala#League system|Guatemala]], [[Football in Honduras#Football competitions|Honduras]], [[Jamaican football league system|Jamaica]], [[Football in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], and [[Football in Panama|Panama]].

This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. The sport is currently popular in various other North American countries.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) is the top professional level of baseball, while [[Minor League Baseball]] (MiLB) comprises several levels and multiple component leagues below MLB. MiLB also has teams and component leagues in Mexico (such as the [[Mexican League|Mexican Baseball League]]) and the Dominican Republic (such as the [[Dominican Summer League]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/info/teams.jsp|title=Teams by Name \u2013 MiLB.com Official Info \u2013 The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|work=MiLB.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> The relationship between MLB and MilB is also the closed, franchise model, which has the same teams playing, and where the ''players'' are transferred between levels. Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, [[college baseball]] plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players.\n\nOther professional leagues in North America include the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pac\u00edfico]] in Mexico, the [[Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League]], the [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]], and the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Series]] is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba. It forms part of the [[Cuban baseball league system]], run by the [[Baseball Federation of Cuba]], the governing body of baseball in that country. Amateur baseball in Canada includes [[Ligue de Baseball \u00c9lite du Qu\u00e9bec]], the [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]], and the [[Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League]].

Many [[College athletics in the United States|college sports in the U.S.]] are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] for large schools, [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] for smaller schools, and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] for schools who do not offer any [[athletic scholarship]] to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by [[U Sports]] for universities and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] for colleges.

The NCAA further divides its Division I football teams into the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]. The Football Bowl Subdivision has the largest and most competitive schools, and is noted for its system of postseason [[bowl game]]s.\n\n[[USA Football]] is the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for amateur American football in the U.S., and is a member of the [[International Federation of American Football]] (IFAF), the international governing body of American football associations. Several other North American counties are a part of [[IFAF Americas]], the federation of IFAF members in the Americas.\n\nIn Mexico, the [[Liga de F\u00fatbol Americano Profesional]] is the professional league, while [[ONEFA]] organizes college football.\n\n====Canadian football====\nThe [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) is the highest professional level of Canadian football, with teams across Canada. Teams from Canadian universities compete in [[U Sports football]]. The [[Canadian Junior Football League]] and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] field teams with players aged 18\u201322.\n\n[[Football Canada]] is the governing body for amateur Canadian football. Although it primarily focuses on the Canadian form of the game, it is also a member of the International Federation of American Football.\n\n====Association football====\n[[CONCACAF]] is the continental governing body for association football in North America, and runs two visible tournaments: the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] and the Champions League <ref name=\"concacaf.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.concacaf.com/concacaf|title=CONCACAF|work=CONCACAF}}</ref> The Gold Cup is competed every two years among the [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] to determine the regional champion of North America.

This Mexican league system uses [[promotion and relegation]], where teams are transferred between levels based on their final records at the end of the season. For women, the [[Super Liga Femenil de F\u00fatbol]] is at the top level.\n\nThe men's professional soccer league systems in both [[United States soccer league system|the U.S.]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]] instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the the [[USL Championship]]. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: [[League1 Ontario]] and [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]], as well as a separate level-one league, the [[Canadian Premier League]]. The United States has the [[USL League One]] and [[National Independent Soccer Association]], which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] is at the top level, and [[United Women's Soccer]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] are at the second level. [[College soccer]] is played both in the U.S. and Canada, with top players often going on to play professional.\n\nOther countries with multi-level professional league systems include [[Football in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Football in El Salvador#League System|El Salvador]], [[Football in Guatemala#League system|Guatemala]], [[Football in Honduras#Football competitions|Honduras]], [[Jamaican football league system|Jamaica]], [[Football in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], and [[Football in Panama|Panama]].

By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. The sport is currently popular in various other North American countries.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) is the top professional level of baseball, while [[Minor League Baseball]] (MiLB) comprises several levels and multiple component leagues below MLB.

Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, [[college baseball]] plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players.\n\nOther professional leagues in North America include the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pac\u00edfico]] in Mexico, the [[Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League]], the [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]], and the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Series]] is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba.

{"title_page": "Stabat Mater (Palestrina)", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n'''''[[Stabat Mater]]''''' is a [[Motet]] for Double Chorus by [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]. It was composed in the Late [[Renaissance|Renaissance Period]] sometime during the late 16th century. It is centered on the 20 verses of text that constitute the [[hymn]] of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stabat Mater - Definition|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Stabat+Mater|website=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe text predates [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s composition and dates as far back as the 13th century. The author of the text is unknown. Some possible authors include: [[Bonaventure|St. Bonaventure]], [[Pope Innocent III]], and [[Jacopone da Todi]], a [[Franciscan friar|Franciscan Friar]]. The liturgical text is centered on [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]'s suffering at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion of Christ]]. It has both a regular [[Meter (music)|meter]] \u2013 frequently [[Trochaic meter|trochaic]] \u2013 and an intricate rhyme scheme, both of which are qualities that most academics date back to the 12th century.\n\nPalestrina's [[Stabat Mater]] appears to have been written for [[Pope Gregory XIV]], who was Pope from 1590 until his death in 1591. Therefore, the work may have been composed during this time\u2013 a period which was within the final years of Palestrina's life. Since then, the work was initially guarded closely by the choir for which was written. The first part was performed annually on Palm Sunday at a slower tempo.\n\nIn [[Rome]] in 1770, the English historian Dr. Burney was able to obtain a copy of the work. This acquisition produced the first printed edition in 1771 in London, in \"La Musica Che Si canta annualmente nelle Funzioni della Settimana Santa nella Capella Pontificia\". Since then the composition has had many editions, including an edition by the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] in 1877.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n[[Stabat Mater]] is a [[Motet]] for unaccompanied Double Chorus, and consists of 20 sections in accordance with the 20 verses of text. It is scored for Double Chorus, with both choruses set for [[SATB]] chorus. It contains rare examples of anticipation, which are relatively early for its time. It also contains many suspensions. The texture is thick and is more [[homophonic]] than [[contrapuntal]].\n\nThe two choruses alternate during the work, usually per line of verse. Within the work there are moments of full chorus, where both choruses sing together, and moments with soloists within the two choirs.\n\nIt contains changes in tempo: It begins as ''Adagio ma non troppo'' and slows to ''Largo'' at the beginning of the 9th verse. At the start of verse 11, it returns to the first tempo, but this time ''un poco animato''. The tempo winds down to ''Piu Lento'' at the beginning of verse 20, before slowing down to ''Largo'' for the final 9 bars.\n\nThe work either begins on the dominant of D [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] or on the tonic A [[Mixolydian]] with an unexpected progression of four major chords, which is an unusual chord progression for this time period. This composition arguably concludes in D Major with a cadence that spans three bars.\n\n== Text ==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\nStabat Mater dolor\u00f3sa\nJuxta crucem lacrim\u00f3sa,\nDum pend\u00e9bat Filius.\n\nCujus \u00e1nimam gem\u00e9ntem,\nContrist\u00e1tam, et dol\u00e9ntem,\nPertransivit gladius.\n\nO quam tristis et afflicta\nFuit illa benedicta \nMater Unig\u00e9niti!\n\nQuae m\u0153r\u00e9bat, et dol\u00e9bat\nEt tremebat, cum vid\u00e9bat \nNati p\u0153nas inclyti.\n\nQuis est homo qui non fleret,\nChristi Matrem si vider\u00e9t\nIn tanto supplicio?\n\nQuis non posset contrist\u00e1ri\nPiam Matrem contempl\u00e1ri\nDol\u00e9ntem cum Filio?\n\nPro pecc\u00e1tis su\u00e6 gentis\nVidit Jesum in torm\u00e9ntis,\nEt flag\u00e9llis s\u00fabditum.\n\nVidit suum dulcem natum\nMori\u00e9ntem desol\u00e1tum,\nDum emisit spiritum.\n\nEia, Mater, fons am\u00f3ris,\nMe sentire vim dol\u00f3ris\nFac, ut tecum l\u00fageam.\n\nFac ut \u00e1rdeat cor meum \nIn am\u00e1ndo Christum Deum,\nUt sibi compl\u00e1ceam.\n\nSancta Mater, istud agas,\nCrucifixi fige plagas\nCordi meo v\u00e1lide.\n\nTui nati vulner\u00e1ti,\nTam dign\u00e1ti pro me pati,\nP\u0153nas mecum divide.\n\nFac me tecum pie flere,\nCrucifixo condolere\nDonec ego vixero,\n\nJuxta crucem tecum stare\nEt me tibi soci\u00e1re\nIn planctu desidero.\n\nVirgo virginum pr\u00e6cl\u00e1ra,\nMihi jam non sis am\u00e1ra,\nFac me tecum pl\u00e1ngere.\n\nFac ut portem Christi mortem,\nPassi\u00f3nis fac cons\u00f3rtem,\nEt plagas rec\u00f3lere.\n\nFac me plagis vulner\u00e1ri,\nCruce hac inebri\u00e1ri,\nEt cru\u00f3re Filii.\n\nInflammatus et acc\u00e9nsus,\nPer te Virgo sim def\u00e9nsus\nIn die judicii.\n\nFac me cruce custodiri,\nMorte Christi praemuniri\nConfoveri gratia:\n\nQuando corpus mori\u00e9tur\nFac ut \u00e1nim\u00e6 don\u00e9tur\nParadisi Gl\u00f3ria.\n</poem>\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\nAt the cross her station keeping,\nMary stood in sorrow weeping\nWhen her Son was crucified.\n\nWhile she waited in her anguish,\nSeeing Christ in torment languish,\nBitter sorrow pierced her heart.\n\nWith what pain and desolation,\nWith what noble resignation,\nMary watched her dying Son.\n\nEver-patient in her yearning\nThrough her tear-filled eyes were burning\nMary gazed upon her Son.\n\nWho, that sorrow contemplating,\nOn that passion meditating,\nWould not share the Virgin's grief?\n\nChrist she saw, for our salvation,\nScourged with cruel acclamation,\nBruised and beaten by the rod.\n\nChrist she saw with life-blood failing,\nAll her anguish unavailing,\nSaw him breathe his very last.\n\nMary, fount of love's devotion,\nLet me share with true emotion\nAll the sorrow you endured.\n\nVirgin, ever interceding,\nHear me in my fervent pleading:\nFire me with your love of Christ.\n\nMother, may this prayer be granted:\nThat Christ's love may be implanted\nIn the depths of my poor soul\n\nAt the cross, your sorrow sharing,\nAll your grief and torment bearing,\nLet me stand and mourn with you.\n\nFairest maid of all creation,\nQueen of hope and consolation,\nLet me feel your grief sublime.\n\nVirgin, in your love befriend me,\nAt the Judgement Day defend me.\nHelp me by your constant prayer.\n\nSaviour, when my life shall leave me,\nThrough your mother's prayers receive me\nWith the fruits of victory.\n\nVirgin of all virgins blest!\nListen to my fond request:\nLet me share your grief divine\n\nLet me, to my latest breath,\nIn my body bear the death\nOf your dying Son divine.\n\nWounded with His every wound,\nSteep my til' it has swooned\nIn His very Blood away\n\nBe to me, O virgin, nigh\nLest in flames I burn and die,\nIn His awe-full judgement day.\n\nSaviour, when my life shall leave me,\nThrough your mother's prayers receive me\nWith the fruits of victory.\n\nWhile body here decays\nMay my soul your goodness praise,\nSafe in heaven eternally.\n</poem>\n{{col-end}}\n\n== See also ==\n[http://www3.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Stabat_Mater_%28Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina%29 Choral Public Domain Library information on Stabat Mater by Palestrina]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stabat Mater}}\n[[Category:Stabat Mater settings|Palestrina]]\n[[Category:Compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n[[Category:Motets]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n'''''[[Stabat Mater]]''''' is a [[Motet]] for Double Chorus by [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]].
