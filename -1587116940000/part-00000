station on the [[Berlin]] [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[suburban railway]] and the busiest [[interchange station]] in [[Berlin]]. It is in the former [[East Berlin]] district of [[Friedrichshain]], now part of the [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]. A smaller part of the station is in [[Rummelsburg]], part of the borough of [[Lichtenberg]]. The station is a ''Turmbahnhof'' (\u201ctower station\u201d, that is a two-level interchange) with the [[Berlin\u2013Wroc\u0142aw railway|Berlin\u2013Frankfurt (Oder) railway]] (\u201cLower Silesian\u2013Marcher Railway\u201d) and the [[Prussian Eastern Railway]] on the lower level and the [[Berlin Ringbahn]] on the upper level. It is used by a total of around 235,000 passengers every day on eight lines, entering or leaving.\n\nThe station was completely reconstructed from 2006 to December 2018 while train operations at the station continued. In the past it was exclusively used as a Berlin S-Bahn station, but it is now also a stopping point for regional services.\n\n==History ==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1204-015, Berlin, S-Bahnhof Ostkreuz.jpg|thumb|left|Platform E with departing train, platform D on the left, Bahnsteig F above, 1981]]\n[[File:19910827a Ostkreuz.jpg|thumb|left|Platform F (above) and platform E (Erkner line), 1991]]\n[[File:19910327a Ostkreuz.jpg|thumb|left|Platform A and the connecting curve to the northern Ringbahn (to the left) and the southern Ringbahn, 1991]]\n\nA railway crossing point in the area later called Ostkreuz was created in 1871 with the commissioning of the Ringbahn which there crossed the tracks of the Lower Silesian\u2013Marcher Railway (''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkische Bahn'', also called the Silesian Railway), which was opened in 1842, and the Eastern Railway, which was extended to Berlin in 1867. This crossing was supplemented by two connecting curves from the Ringbahn to the tracks towards the city in 1872. Initially, they only served freight traffic, but on 1 January 1872 passenger traffic ran from the newly built ''Stralau'' station on the south curve to the ''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkisches'' station (later called just the ''Schlesischer''\u2014\"Silesian\"\u2014station, now the [[Berlin Ostbahnhof|Ostbahnhof]]).<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\">{{cite journal|title=Zugr\u00e4der rollten seit 1871&nbsp;\u2013 Abriss der Geschichte der S\u00fcdkurve |journal=Punkt 3 |issue=23 |date=2017 |p=4 |url=http://www.punkt3.de/artikel/5644  |accessdate=23 July 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThere was no station at the intersection of the railway lines at that time. A transfer station was instead built south of it at the junction with the connecting curve. It was initially called ''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkischer Anschlu\u00df'' (\"Lower Silesian\u2013Marcher connection\") and was renamed ''Stralau'' in April 1872.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} This provided connections between passenger trains on the connecting curve and commuter trains to/from the Silesian station.\n\nAround 1880, the railway facilities in this area were completely rebuilt. While the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway formerly ran in parallel and ended at different stations, they were combined with the reconstruction of both lines east of the connecting curves to the Ringbahn. Passenger traffic of both lines ran to the Silesian station and subsequently the old terminus of the Eastern Railway, [[Berlin Old Ostbahnhof|Old Ostbahnhof]], served only goods traffic. [[Berlin Frankfurter Allee\u2013Berlin-Rummelsburg railway|Two lines]] connected the newly built shunting yards in [[Berlin-Lichtenberg station|Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde]] and [[Berlin-Rummelsburg Betriebsbahnhof station|Rummelsburg]] to the Ringbahn. Previously, freight trains from the lines from the east to the Ringbahn had to make an awkward reversal in the Silesian station.\n \nDuring the construction of the tracks at the Silesian station, the passenger tracks running from there to the east were also rebuilt. The southern pair of tracks served the traffic to the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway, which branched in the area where the Ringbahn crosses. The northern track pair was built in a slightly different position than the earlier connecting curves. It served only the suburban traffic and connected to the Ringbahn to the north and to the south.{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} The construction of new connecting ramps in the area of the later Ostkreuz station, in a different location than the old ones, began on 1 September 1879 together with the reconstruction of the railway tracks in the Silesian station. During the construction work, the passenger traffic was temporarily relocated to the old Ostbahnhof station. In July 1880, the Silesian station went back into service for passenger traffic, followed by further construction work to connect it with the new [[Berlin Stadtbahn]].{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} ''Stralau-Rummelsburg'' station was opened with the commissioning of this work on 7&nbsp;February 1882.\n\n===Stralau-Rummelsburg station===\nThe station was named after the nearby villages of Stralau and [[Rummelsburg]]. The halts of Stralau on the Ringbahn and [[Berlin-Rummelsburg railway station|Rummelsburg]] on the Silesian Railway were closed with the opening of the new station.{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} The station was owned jointly by the Eastern Railway, the Silesian Railway and the Ringbahn.{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} It had a platform (later platform&nbsp;A) between the two connecting curves, an \"intermediate\" platform (in Germany, a low island platform with one platform edge and sometimes accessed by passengers across a rail track) on each of the curves connecting in opposite directions and a side and intermediate platform on the tracks of the Silesian Railway.{{sfn|Demps|1991|pp=173\u2013179}} There was no platform on the tracks of the Eastern Railway, so its trains stopped at the platforms of the Silesian Railway if necessary. There was a crossover east of the station and another crossover at the present Modersohn bridge to the west of the station.{{sfn|Bley|1992|pp=91\u2013108}} As there was no platform on the through Ringbahn tracks, no passenger trains stopped on it. The suburban trains of the Ringbahn coming from both the north and south ran via the connecting curves to Stralau-Rummelsburg station on the Stadtbahn and vice versa in the opposite direction. Stralau-Rummelsburg was also the end or starting point for some trains running on the Stadtbahn.\n \nThe later platforms B and C were opened in 1896 on the outsides of the two connecting curves and replaced the existing intermediate platforms. They were built to serve increased traffic as a result of the [[Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin]] held in Treptow in 1896.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Die Berliner Gewerbeausstellung. II. Die Verkehrsverh\u00e4ltnisse |journal =Zentralblatt der Bauverwaltung |date=1896-03-21 |url=https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/readingmode/14688302_1896/143/ |pp=126\u2013128|language=de}}</ref>\n\n===The first major reconstruction of the station===\n<!--[[File:PlanStralauRummelsburg1900.jpg|thumb|Railway facilities around Stralau-Rummelsburg after the reconstruction in 1900, according to a plan of 1896]]-->\n \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the station and the railway facilities adjoining to the east were rebuilt because the at-grade junctions of the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway at the station had become an obstacle to the growing traffic. East of the station, the tracks for the long-distance lines were separated from the suburban lines and elevated on both lines.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} The Eastern Railway received two suburban tracks and a goods track to their north, while the long-distance traffic of the Eastern Railway ran over the [[VnK Railway|VnK line]] to join the Silesian Railway further east. On the Silesian Railway the suburban tracks were separated from the long-distance tracks. The suburban tracks of the Stadtbahn were connected with those of Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway in Stralau-Rummelsburg station. The associated platforms were put in operation on 1&nbsp;October 1903 (Eastern Railway, platform&nbsp;D){{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} and 18&nbsp;April 1903 (Silesian Railway, platform E).{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=300}} The new platform&nbsp;F on the Ringbahn on the upper level of the station went into operation on 1&nbsp;May 1903.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} At the same time, platform D also received a new entrance building on the west side of the platform giving access to the upper level platforms&nbsp;A, B and&nbsp;C.{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=300}} Since the reconstruction, suburban trains have run directly from the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway to the suburban tracks of the Stadtbahn and the suburban tracks of the Ringbahn have run through the upper platform of the station.\n \nWith the reconstruction at the beginning of the 20th century, the core of the station received the design by which it was known for over 100 years. Some alterations took place from 1923 to designs by Richard Brademann. A pedestrian bridge was built over platforms&nbsp;D and E with exits to Hauptstra\u00dfe and Sonntagstra\u00dfe and ticket offices at each end.\n \nElectrical operations gradually commenced on all suburban lines in 1928 and 1929 and they were rebranded as the [[Berlin S-Bahn]] in 1930. A [[Rectifier|rectification plant]] was built on the Markgrafendamm south of the station. The platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}}\n\n===Ostkreuz station after 1933===\n\nOn 15 March 1933, the station was renamed ''Ostkreuz'', following the renaming of [[Berlin Westkreuz station|Westkreuz]] a few years earlier. According to the [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania plan]] of the [[Nazis]] for the reconstruction of Berlin as capital of the [[Third Reich]], a major station would have been built at Ostkreuz as the ''Ostbahnhof'' (east station). The planned nine mainline platforms would have been east of the Ringbahn. The S-Bahn services would have used  three low-level platforms instead of two platforms and another new platform was intended as a replacement for platform A on the connecting curve from the city to the southern Ringbahn.{{sfn|Kuhlmann|2008|p=40}}\n \nIn the Second World War, the station area was severely damaged by bombing. Nevertheless, from June 1945, the operation of trains was gradually resumed. The two S-Bahn tracks of the Silesian Railway were dismantled after the end of the Second World War for [[war reparations]], so with the reconstruction of the S-Bahn line (initially as a single track) in January 1948, trains stopped at a temporary platform on the mainline tracks. The southern Ringbahn curve was out of service from February/March 1945\u2014probably as a result of heavy air raids\u2014and was only usable again from August 1946.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\"/>\n\nWith the division of Berlin, the traffic importance of the station grew further because a number of through connections through the city had become unavailable since, at the latest, the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. In addition, new large residential areas were developed in the east of the city that were accessible by the S-Bahn, especially in the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}}\n\nThe outer platforms on the northern and southern connecting curve to the Ringbahn were closed in 1966 due to structural defects and were later demolished. Scheduled passenger services on the northern Ringbahn curve ended in 1994. The northern curve was occasionally used for stock transfers and excursions until May 2006. The tracks were then removed gradually during the reconstruction.\n\n===Rebuilding the station 2008\u201318===\n[[File:Ostkreuz1996.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Layout before the reconstruction]]\nThe station was greatly in need of renovation for decades and was not capable of handling peak hour traffic partly due to its narrow stairs. For a long time there were proposals to restructure it in order to make the stairs and passages more usable. In the mid-1950s, the [[Berliner Zeitung]] surveyed its readers for ideas to improve the situation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wir brauchen Platz statt Schranken. Neue Vorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr Ostkreuz Die Berliner haben gute Ideen. |newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |date= 6 April 1955 |page= 6 |language=German}}</ref> As a result, [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|Deutsche Reichsbahn]] announced in early 1956 that the stairs from the Ringbahn platform to the low-level platform D would be widened by one metre. However, a complete renovation of the station would be necessary after this \"small solution\" was carried out.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breitere Treppe f\u00fcr Ostkreuz.

Provision was made for the construction of escalators. It was expected to cost 7.5 million [[East German mark|marks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Im Siebenjahrplan: Neues Ostkreuz. 1963 beginnt Bahnhofsumbau / Verbindungstunnel und Rolltreppen |newspaper=Berliner Zeitung |date= 15 May 1959 |page= 10 |language=German}}</ref> In 1986, [[Erich Honecker]] announced  the beginning of the \"complex reconstruction\" of the Ostkreuz S-Bahn junction for the period up to 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wir wollen, da\u00df die heute lebenden und die kommenden Generationen in Frieden ihr Gl\u00fcck erbauen k\u00f6nnen.

No major changes occurred at the station for decades and it was referred to ironically as ''Rostkreuz'' (\"rust cross\"). It is now partially protected as a monument,<ref name=\"ldl09095164\"/> so that compromises to preserve the historic buildings have had to be made to the proposed redevelopment of the station complex.\n\n====Planning ====\n[[File:Ostkreuz2016.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Planned layout after completion of the reconstruction in 2018]]\nConcrete plans for rebuilding Ostkreuz station were included in a project for \"improving the Berlin railway node\" after [[German reunification]]. This project was classified in the federal railway development act (''Bundesschienenwegeausbaugesetz'') as an \"absolute priority\" and it aimed to improve the performance of the networks of the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn railways in Berlin and to improve urban transport significantly.<ref name=\"pfb\" />\n\nOn 30 October 2006, the [[Federal Railway Authority]] gave planning approval for the first stage of the project.<ref name=\"pfb\">{{cite book |title= Planfeststellungsbeschluss PFA 1. |publisher= Eisenbahn-Bundesamt |date= 30 October 2006 |language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"TS-06-11-08\" /> On 19 September 2012, the planning approval was issued for the second stage. This mainly comprises the railway infrastructure along Hauptstra\u00dfe to Schlichtallee including the southern overpass over Karlshorster Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"pfb2\">{{cite book |title= Planfeststellungsbeschluss PFA 2. |publisher= Eisenbahn-Bundesamt |date= 19 September 2012 |language=German}}</ref>\n \nThe reconstruction of the railway facilities went into full operation in December 2018. Transport planners expect the station to be used by over 123,000 passengers a day as a result of the reconstruction.<ref name=\"db-umbau\" />\n\nThe [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe]] has also considered extending [[U1 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn line U1]] to Ostkreuz station. The U1 would thus connect large parts of [[Kreuzberg]] to the eastern [[Berlin Ringbahn|Ringbahn]]. This project would be realised after 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/verkehr/gespraeche-ueber-neuen-u-bahn-bahnhof-u-bahn-linie-u1-soll-bis-zum-ostkreuz-fahren,10809298,29004146.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312133839/https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/verkehr/gespraeche-ueber-neuen-u-bahn-bahnhof-u-bahn-linie-u1-soll-bis-zum-ostkreuz-fahren-396152|archivedate=12 March 2016|title=Gespr\u00e4che \u00fcber neuen U-Bahn-Bahnhof&nbsp;\u2013 U-Bahn-Linie U1 soll bis zum Ostkreuz fahren|newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|date= 10 November 2014|accessdate=24 July 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n\n====Construction project====\n[[File:Ostkreuz1.jpg|thumb|Bridges of the old south Ringbahn curve before demolition, 2005]]\nThe project included, in addition to Ostkreuz station, the tracks between [[Berlin Ostbahnhof|Ostbahnhof]] in the west and N\u00f6ldnerplatz and [[Rummelsburg]] in the east including the reconstruction of [[Berlin Warschauer Stra\u00dfe station]] and the tracks to the [[Berlin Treptower Park station]] to the south.\n \nThe reconstruction amounted to new construction, which was carried out while trains are running and therefore took over ten years to complete. All essential facilities of the station, such as platforms, stairs, bridges and track systems were remodeled or rebuilt. Among other things, 12 [[Elevator|lifts]] and 17 [[escalator]] were installed and new entrances from all four surrounding districts were built. Because of the requirements of the preservation of heritage-listed buildings, compromises had to be made to preserve the historical structure.\n \nThe facilities of the new station differ in many ways from those of the old. Prior to the rebuilding, S-Bahn trains on the line to [[Erkner station|Erkner]] stopped at one platform and the trains on the lines to [[Strausberg station|Strausberg]], [[Ahrensfelde station|Ahrensfelde]] and [[Wartenberg station|Wartenberg]] via [[Berlin-Lichtenberg station|Lichtenberg]] stopped at another. Since the reconstruction, the two lower platforms have been served by train running in the same direction to allow easy interchange (known as ''Richtungsbetrieb''\u2014directional operation). The northern platform is served by all trains running towards the city centre, while the southern platform is used by trains running in the opposite direction. The track from Erkner crosses the track to Lichtenberg on a bridge to the east of the platforms. The Ringbahn S-Bahn platform was rebuilt at the old location, but it is now much wider and has been given a [[train shed]]. There is now no platform at the connecting curve from the southern Ringbahn to Stadtbahn, which is used by line S9 from [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]].\n\nRegional platforms were built on the low-level part of the station on both the Silesian Railway (south of the S-Bahn) for trains running east\u2013west and the Eastern Railway (north of the S-Bahn).

There were also platforms on the long-distance tracks of the Silesian Railway and the Eastern Railway, which separated to the east of the station. Presumably, there was an island platform on the northern track and an intermediate platform on the southern track. In addition, there was a freight track of the Eastern Railway to the north and a freight track of the Silesian Railway to the south of the remaining tracks.\n \nAt the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century, the long-distance and suburban railways were separated by the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway. The lower platforms D and E on the routes to Lichtenberg and Erkner and the upper Ringbahn platform F date back to this time. The tracks of the upper platforms (A, B, C and F) were about six metres above the level of the lower platforms (D and E).{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}}\n \nThe long-distance tracks of the Silesian Railway were built south of the lower platforms, and were not provided with a platform in Ostkreuz. The long-distance tracks of the Ringbahn are located east of the S-Bahn platform. Before the rebuilding there were in addition to the two long-distance tracks still connections to the brake plant in Stralau and the Osthafen (East Harbour). The siding to the harbour crossed the tracks of the Ringbahn in a tunnel to the south of the station.\n\n====Platform A====\n[[File:Berlin-zentrum-by-RalfR-002.jpg|thumb|Platform A has since been demolished]]\nThis platform was in operation from 1882 to 2009 with a few reconstructions. This triangular platform was on an embankment west of platforms D and E between the curved lines connecting the Stadtbahn with the Ringbahn. The platform canopy was supported by one-piece, riveted steel girders.<ref name=\"ldl09095164\"/> Trains from the Stadtbahn to the northern Ringbahn stopped on the northern side of the platform and trains from the southern Ringbahn to the Stadtbahn stopped on the southern side. Scheduled passenger traffic to the north ended in 1994, although until 2006 there were still occasional special and diverted services. Operations on the southern side of the platform ended on 28 August 2009.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\"/> The curve to the southern Ringbahn was removed for the station reconstruction and later rebuilt without a platform.\n\nOriginally ramps ran from the Simplonstra\u00dfe in the north and the Markgrafendamm in the south to the platform and the later entrance building. With the construction of the pedestrian bridge and the two entrance buildings in Sonntagstra\u00dfe and Markgrafendamm, the platform was accessible from the bridge via branches off it. After the destruction of the bridges, the platform was accessible only by stairs from platforms D and E.\n\n====Platforms B and C====\nThe S-Bahn platforms were located on the outsides of the connecting curves. Platform B was on the track connecting the Stadtbahn to the northern Ringbahn, while platform C was on the southern curve connecting towards Treptower Park. They were connected to platform A by a short tunnel.\n\nPlatform C was built in 1895/1896 for the [[Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin|Berlin trade exposition]] in Treptower Park.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" /> It was taken out of service on 12 April 1966 due to disrepair,<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" /> as was platform&nbsp;B in the same year. Trains running towards the southern ring and from the northern ring then ran without stopping, while trains running in the respective opposite directions continued to stop at platform&nbsp;A.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" /> Platform B was demolished in 1970, as was platform C in November 1978.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" />\n\n====Platform D====\nThe S-Bahn platform was at ground level on the S-Bahn tracks of the Eastern Railway running from the Stadtbahn in the east to Lichtenberg in the west. It lay between the wedge-shaped platform &nbsp;A in the east and the Ringbahn platform&nbsp;F in the west, with no platforms on top of each other. Due to the spreading of the tracks from Lichtenberg to accommodate the connecting curves from the Ringbahn the platform was unusually wide. The station building, which stood at its western end, was destroyed in 1945.\n \nThe original canopy of platform&nbsp;D was supported by one-piece, riveted steel girders.<ref name=\"ldl09095164\" /> Platform&nbsp;D was taken out of service on 8&nbsp;May 2013 and was subsequently replaced by a new building.\n\n====Platform E====\n[[File:S-Bahnsteig Ostkreuz mit Kiosk 2007.jpg|thumb|Platform E, 2007]]\nThis S-Bahn platform is also located at street level and parallel to platform D on the S-Bahn tracks of the Silesian Railway to/from Erkner. To the west the tracks connect to the Stadtbahn.

The S-Bahn platform on the Ringbahn was rebuilt in about the old location. The station is supplemented by several new Regionalbahn services.\n\n====Platform D====\nThe new platform&nbsp;D is a platform for west-running services for trains from Erkner and Lichtenberg towards the city center. The observation shed and the platform canopy were rebuilt on the basis of the historic shape of the old platform&nbsp;D. It was opened in October 2014 for trains running towards Lichtenberg only. Trains running towards  the city center have stopped there since August 2017.\n\n====Platform E====\nS-Bahn trains running to the eastern suburbs have stopped at the new platform&nbsp;E since August 2017.<ref name=\"punkt3-19-2017\" /> The observation shed and the platform canopy here were also rebuilt in the style of the old platform.\n\n====Platform F====\n[[File:Berlin - S-Bahnhof Ostkreuz - Neue Ringbahnhalle - Stand 04 2012 (6976652160).jpg|thumb|Ringbahn hall, 2012]]\n \nThe S-Bahn platform of the Ringbahn was built in a similar position as its predecessor, but significantly wider.

Platform F on the Ringbahn is centered, with the white roof. The large dark-colored tower was built to store water for steam trains previously running on these lines.]]\nThe entrance building built in 1903 was on the west side of platform&nbsp;D at the entrance to the oldest part of the station and near platform&nbsp;A. It was destroyed during the Second World War.{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=299}} Its location was still visible on the west side of platform&nbsp;D, which is unusually wide in this area.\nSmall access buildings were later built at the entrances from Sonntagsstra\u00dfe and Markgrafendamm.\n\n===Pedestrian bridge===\n\nThe covered pedestrian bridge, built according to the plans of Richard Brademann in 1923 and 1926,<ref name=\"punkt3-2016-15\" /> connected to platforms&nbsp;D and&nbsp;E close to their western end and had exits to Hauptstra\u00dfe and to Sonntagstra\u00dfe. Originally there was also a direct connection from the bridge over a pier to platform&nbsp;A, which was destroyed during the Second World War.\nIn the course of the station renovation, the bridge was demolished and replaced by a temporary pedestrian bridge. From April 2016 to December 2018, a new structure was built at the same place as a replica of the original bridge with additional connections to the newly added platforms Rn2 and Ru including preserved historical bridge supports and lattice girders in the area of platform&nbsp;D. The staircases and the supports and abutments were built in reinforced concrete, along with the Sonntagstra\u00dfe staircase, which is to be provided with a toilet block on the ground floor. The windows were built to reflect the historical design, but in metal with safety glazing that will meet current standards. The superstructure is covered with asphalt and the steps with natural stone.\nThe first part of the newly constructed bridge went into operation on 3 September 2017, initially as a connection from Hauptstra\u00dfe to platforms E and D. The connection to platform Ru was opened at the timetable change in December 2017.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Kurzmeldungen&nbsp;\u2013 S-Bahn |journal =[[Berliner Verkehrsbl\u00e4tter]] |issue=10 |date=2017 |p=202|language=de}}</ref> The second part of the bridge to Sonntagstra\u00dfe went into operation in December 2018.\n \nAnother pedestrian overpass ran alongside the tracks of the connecting curves from Sonntagstra\u00dfe past platform&nbsp;A and the old entrance building to Markgrafendamm. In contrast to the other pedestrian bridge, it served mainly as a link between the urban areas on both sides and was outside the controlled access area of the station, so it was usable for travellers without tickets. During the Second World War it was destroyed with the entrance building.{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=299}}\n\n===Water tower ===\nImmediately south of the station is a 50-metre-high water tower. This was built from 1909 to 1912 to the design of Karl Cornelius  and served to supply water to the many steam locomotives running from Ostkreuz. Its round trunk is veneered with bricks that are glazed violet. A cylindrical pressure-resistant water tank sits on this; it holds 400 cubic metres and is fully integrated with the roof. The steep pitched roof and the slated polygonal dome exhibit the influence of [[Art Nouveau]]. The water tower is now a symbol of Ostkreuz and a highly visible building. It is listed as a monument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&KEY=obj%2009095165 |title=Heritage listing: Wasserturm |publisher=Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt |date=10 April 2014|accessdate=26 July 2019 |language=de}}</ref>\n\n===Rail officials' house ===\n==== Northern officials' residence (Sonntagstra\u00dfe 37) ====\n[[File:Berlin Ostkreuz - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Northern officials' residence at Sonntagstra\u00dfe 37]]\n[[File:EisenbahnerwohnhausMarkgrafendamm.jpg|thumb|Southern officials' residence at Markgrafendamm 24a]]\nA two-storey residence for railway officials with a [[hipped roof]] was built in 1910 in the triangle between the curve to the north Ringbahn, the Stadtbahn and the Ringbahn.

station on the [[Berlin]] [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[suburban railway]] and the busiest [[interchange station]] in [[Berlin]]. It is in the former [[East Berlin]] district of [[Friedrichshain]], now part of the [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]. A smaller part of the station is in [[Rummelsburg]], part of the borough of [[Lichtenberg]]. The station is a ''Turmbahnhof'' (\u201ctower station\u201d, that is a two-level interchange) with the [[Berlin\u2013Wroc\u0142aw railway|Berlin\u2013Frankfurt (Oder) railway]] (\u201cLower Silesian\u2013Marcher Railway\u201d) and the [[Prussian Eastern Railway]] on the lower level and the [[Berlin Ringbahn]] on the upper level. It is used by a total of around 235,000 passengers every day on eight lines, entering or leaving.\n\nThe station was completely reconstructed from 2006 to December 2018 while train operations at the station continued. In the past it was exclusively used as a Berlin S-Bahn station, but it is now also a stopping point for regional services.\n\n==History ==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1204-015, Berlin, S-Bahnhof Ostkreuz.jpg|thumb|left|Platform E with departing train, platform D on the left, Bahnsteig F above, 1981]]\n[[File:19910827a Ostkreuz.jpg|thumb|left|Platform F (above) and platform E (Erkner line), 1991]]\n[[File:19910327a Ostkreuz.jpg|thumb|left|Platform A and the connecting curve to the northern Ringbahn (to the left) and the southern Ringbahn, 1991]]\n\nA railway crossing point in the area later called Ostkreuz was created in 1871 with the commissioning of the Ringbahn which there crossed the tracks of the Lower Silesian\u2013Marcher Railway (''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkische Bahn'', also called the Silesian Railway), which was opened in 1842, and the Eastern Railway, which was extended to Berlin in 1867. This crossing was supplemented by two connecting curves from the Ringbahn to the tracks towards the city in 1872. Initially, they only served freight traffic, but on 1 January 1872 passenger traffic ran from the newly built ''Stralau'' station on the south curve to the ''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkisches'' station (later called just the ''Schlesischer''\u2014\"Silesian\"\u2014station, now the [[Berlin Ostbahnhof|Ostbahnhof]]).<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\">{{cite journal|title=Zugr\u00e4der rollten seit 1871&nbsp;\u2013 Abriss der Geschichte der S\u00fcdkurve |journal=Punkt 3 |issue=23 |date=2017 |p=4 |url=http://www.punkt3.de/artikel/5644  |accessdate=23 July 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThere was no station at the intersection of the railway lines at that time. A transfer station was instead built south of it at the junction with the connecting curve. It was initially called ''Niederschlesisch-M\u00e4rkischer Anschlu\u00df'' (\"Lower Silesian\u2013Marcher connection\") and was renamed ''Stralau'' in April 1872.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} This provided connections between passenger trains on the connecting curve and commuter trains to/from the Silesian station.\n\nAround 1880, the railway facilities in this area were completely rebuilt. While the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway formerly ran in parallel and ended at different stations, they were combined with the reconstruction of both lines east of the connecting curves to the Ringbahn. Passenger traffic of both lines ran to the Silesian station and subsequently the old terminus of the Eastern Railway, [[Berlin Old Ostbahnhof|Old Ostbahnhof]], served only goods traffic. [[Berlin Frankfurter Allee\u2013Berlin-Rummelsburg railway|Two lines]] connected the newly built shunting yards in [[Berlin-Lichtenberg station|Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde]] and [[Berlin-Rummelsburg Betriebsbahnhof station|Rummelsburg]] to the Ringbahn. Previously, freight trains from the lines from the east to the Ringbahn had to make an awkward reversal in the Silesian station.\n \nDuring the construction of the tracks at the Silesian station, the passenger tracks running from there to the east were also rebuilt. The southern pair of tracks served the traffic to the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway, which branched in the area where the Ringbahn crosses. The northern track pair was built in a slightly different position than the earlier connecting curves. It served only the suburban traffic and connected to the Ringbahn to the north and to the south.{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} The construction of new connecting ramps in the area of the later Ostkreuz station, in a different location than the old ones, began on 1 September 1879 together with the reconstruction of the railway tracks in the Silesian station. During the construction work, the passenger traffic was temporarily relocated to the old Ostbahnhof station. In July 1880, the Silesian station went back into service for passenger traffic, followed by further construction work to connect it with the new [[Berlin Stadtbahn]].{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} ''Stralau-Rummelsburg'' station was opened with the commissioning of this work on 7&nbsp;February 1882.\n\n===Stralau-Rummelsburg station===\nThe station was named after the nearby villages of Stralau and [[Rummelsburg]]. The halts of Stralau on the Ringbahn and [[Berlin-Rummelsburg railway station|Rummelsburg]] on the Silesian Railway were closed with the opening of the new station.{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} The station was owned jointly by the Eastern Railway, the Silesian Railway and the Ringbahn.{{sfn|Ministry of Public Works|1896|pp=207\u2013208}} It had a platform (later platform&nbsp;A) between the two connecting curves, an \"intermediate\" platform (in Germany, a low island platform with one platform edge and sometimes accessed by passengers across a rail track) on each of the curves connecting in opposite directions and a side and intermediate platform on the tracks of the Silesian Railway.{{sfn|Demps|1991|pp=173\u2013179}} There was no platform on the tracks of the Eastern Railway, so its trains stopped at the platforms of the Silesian Railway if necessary. There was a crossover east of the station and another crossover at the present Modersohn bridge to the west of the station.{{sfn|Bley|1992|pp=91\u2013108}} As there was no platform on the through Ringbahn tracks, no passenger trains stopped on it. The suburban trains of the Ringbahn coming from both the north and south ran via the connecting curves to Stralau-Rummelsburg station on the Stadtbahn and vice versa in the opposite direction. Stralau-Rummelsburg was also the end or starting point for some trains running on the Stadtbahn.\n \nThe later platforms B and C were opened in 1896 on the outsides of the two connecting curves and replaced the existing intermediate platforms. They were built to serve increased traffic as a result of the [[Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin]] held in Treptow in 1896.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Die Berliner Gewerbeausstellung. II. Die Verkehrsverh\u00e4ltnisse |journal =Zentralblatt der Bauverwaltung |date=1896-03-21 |url=https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/readingmode/14688302_1896/143/ |pp=126\u2013128|language=de}}</ref>\n\n===The first major reconstruction of the station===\n<!--[[File:PlanStralauRummelsburg1900.jpg|thumb|Railway facilities around Stralau-Rummelsburg after the reconstruction in 1900, according to a plan of 1896]]-->\n \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the station and the railway facilities adjoining to the east were rebuilt because the at-grade junctions of the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway at the station had become an obstacle to the growing traffic. East of the station, the tracks for the long-distance lines were separated from the suburban lines and elevated on both lines.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} The Eastern Railway received two suburban tracks and a goods track to their north, while the long-distance traffic of the Eastern Railway ran over the [[VnK Railway|VnK line]] to join the Silesian Railway further east. On the Silesian Railway the suburban tracks were separated from the long-distance tracks. The suburban tracks of the Stadtbahn were connected with those of Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway in Stralau-Rummelsburg station. The associated platforms were put in operation on 1&nbsp;October 1903 (Eastern Railway, platform&nbsp;D){{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} and 18&nbsp;April 1903 (Silesian Railway, platform E).{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=300}} The new platform&nbsp;F on the Ringbahn on the upper level of the station went into operation on 1&nbsp;May 1903.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}} At the same time, platform D also received a new entrance building on the west side of the platform giving access to the upper level platforms&nbsp;A, B and&nbsp;C.{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=300}} Since the reconstruction, suburban trains have run directly from the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway to the suburban tracks of the Stadtbahn and the suburban tracks of the Ringbahn have run through the upper platform of the station.\n \nWith the reconstruction at the beginning of the 20th century, the core of the station received the design by which it was known for over 100 years. Some alterations took place from 1923 to designs by Richard Brademann. A pedestrian bridge was built over platforms&nbsp;D and E with exits to Hauptstra\u00dfe and Sonntagstra\u00dfe and ticket offices at each end.\n \nElectrical operations gradually commenced on all suburban lines in 1928 and 1929 and they were rebranded as the [[Berlin S-Bahn]] in 1930. A [[Rectifier|rectification plant]] was built on the Markgrafendamm south of the station. The platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}}\n\n===Ostkreuz station after 1933===\n\nOn 15 March 1933, the station was renamed ''Ostkreuz'', following the renaming of [[Berlin Westkreuz station|Westkreuz]] a few years earlier. According to the [[Welthauptstadt Germania|Germania plan]] of the [[Nazis]] for the reconstruction of Berlin as capital of the [[Third Reich]], a major station would have been built at Ostkreuz as the ''Ostbahnhof'' (east station). The planned nine mainline platforms would have been east of the Ringbahn. The S-Bahn services would have used  three low-level platforms instead of two platforms and another new platform was intended as a replacement for platform A on the connecting curve from the city to the southern Ringbahn.{{sfn|Kuhlmann|2008|p=40}}\n \nIn the Second World War, the station area was severely damaged by bombing. Nevertheless, from June 1945, the operation of trains was gradually resumed. The two S-Bahn tracks of the Silesian Railway were dismantled after the end of the Second World War for [[war reparations]], so with the reconstruction of the S-Bahn line (initially as a single track) in January 1948, trains stopped at a temporary platform on the mainline tracks. The southern Ringbahn curve was out of service from February/March 1945\u2014probably as a result of heavy air raids\u2014and was only usable again from August 1946.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\"/>\n\nWith the division of Berlin, the traffic importance of the station grew further because a number of through connections through the city had become unavailable since, at the latest, the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. In addition, new large residential areas were developed in the east of the city that were accessible by the S-Bahn, especially in the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}}\n\nThe outer platforms on the northern and southern connecting curve to the Ringbahn were closed in 1966 due to structural defects and were later demolished. Scheduled passenger services on the northern Ringbahn curve ended in 1994. The northern curve was occasionally used for stock transfers and excursions until May 2006. The tracks were then removed gradually during the reconstruction.\n\n===Rebuilding the station 2008\u201318===\n[[File:Ostkreuz1996.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Layout before the reconstruction]]\nThe station was greatly in need of renovation for decades and was not capable of handling peak hour traffic partly due to its narrow stairs. For a long time there were proposals to restructure it in order to make the stairs and passages more usable. In the mid-1950s, the [[Berliner Zeitung]] surveyed its readers for ideas to improve the situation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wir brauchen Platz statt Schranken. Neue Vorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr Ostkreuz Die Berliner haben gute Ideen. |newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |date= 6 April 1955 |page= 6 |language=German}}</ref> As a result, [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|Deutsche Reichsbahn]] announced in early 1956 that the stairs from the Ringbahn platform to the low-level platform D would be widened by one metre. However, a complete renovation of the station would be necessary after this \"small solution\" was carried out.<ref>{{cite news|title=Breitere Treppe f\u00fcr Ostkreuz.

Provision was made for the construction of escalators. It was expected to cost 7.5 million [[East German mark|marks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Im Siebenjahrplan: Neues Ostkreuz. 1963 beginnt Bahnhofsumbau / Verbindungstunnel und Rolltreppen |newspaper=Berliner Zeitung |date= 15 May 1959 |page= 10 |language=German}}</ref> In 1986, [[Erich Honecker]] announced  the beginning of the \"complex reconstruction\" of the Ostkreuz S-Bahn junction for the period up to 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wir wollen, da\u00df die heute lebenden und die kommenden Generationen in Frieden ihr Gl\u00fcck erbauen k\u00f6nnen.

No major changes occurred at the station for decades and it was referred to ironically as ''Rostkreuz'' (\"rust cross\"). It is now partially protected as a monument,<ref name=\"ldl09095164\"/> so that compromises to preserve the historic buildings have had to be made to the proposed redevelopment of the station complex.\n\n====Planning ====\n[[File:Ostkreuz2016.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Planned layout after completion of the reconstruction in 2018]]\nConcrete plans for rebuilding Ostkreuz station were included in a project for \"improving the Berlin railway node\" after [[German reunification]]. This project was classified in the federal railway development act (''Bundesschienenwegeausbaugesetz'') as an \"absolute priority\" and it aimed to improve the performance of the networks of the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn railways in Berlin and to improve urban transport significantly.<ref name=\"pfb\" />\n\nOn 30 October 2006, the [[Federal Railway Authority]] gave planning approval for the first stage of the project.<ref name=\"pfb\">{{cite book |title= Planfeststellungsbeschluss PFA 1. |publisher= Eisenbahn-Bundesamt |date= 30 October 2006 |language=German}}</ref><ref name=\"TS-06-11-08\" /> On 19 September 2012, the planning approval was issued for the second stage. This mainly comprises the railway infrastructure along Hauptstra\u00dfe to Schlichtallee including the southern overpass over Karlshorster Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"pfb2\">{{cite book |title= Planfeststellungsbeschluss PFA 2. |publisher= Eisenbahn-Bundesamt |date= 19 September 2012 |language=German}}</ref>\n \nThe reconstruction of the railway facilities went into full operation in December 2018. Transport planners expect the station to be used by over 123,000 passengers a day as a result of the reconstruction.<ref name=\"db-umbau\" />\n\nThe [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe]] has also considered extending [[U1 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn line U1]] to Ostkreuz station. The U1 would thus connect large parts of [[Kreuzberg]] to the eastern [[Berlin Ringbahn|Ringbahn]]. This project would be realised after 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/verkehr/gespraeche-ueber-neuen-u-bahn-bahnhof-u-bahn-linie-u1-soll-bis-zum-ostkreuz-fahren,10809298,29004146.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312133839/https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/verkehr/gespraeche-ueber-neuen-u-bahn-bahnhof-u-bahn-linie-u1-soll-bis-zum-ostkreuz-fahren-396152|archivedate=12 March 2016|title=Gespr\u00e4che \u00fcber neuen U-Bahn-Bahnhof&nbsp;\u2013 U-Bahn-Linie U1 soll bis zum Ostkreuz fahren|newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|date= 10 November 2014|accessdate=24 July 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n\n====Construction project====\n[[File:Ostkreuz1.jpg|thumb|Bridges of the old south Ringbahn curve before demolition, 2005]]\nThe project included, in addition to Ostkreuz station, the tracks between [[Berlin Ostbahnhof|Ostbahnhof]] in the west and N\u00f6ldnerplatz and [[Rummelsburg]] in the east including the reconstruction of [[Berlin Warschauer Stra\u00dfe station]] and the tracks to the [[Berlin Treptower Park station]] to the south.\n \nThe reconstruction amounted to new construction, which was carried out while trains are running and therefore took over ten years to complete. All essential facilities of the station, such as platforms, stairs, bridges and track systems were remodeled or rebuilt. Among other things, 12 [[Elevator|lifts]] and 17 [[escalator]] were installed and new entrances from all four surrounding districts were built. Because of the requirements of the preservation of heritage-listed buildings, compromises had to be made to preserve the historical structure.\n \nThe facilities of the new station differ in many ways from those of the old. Prior to the rebuilding, S-Bahn trains on the line to [[Erkner station|Erkner]] stopped at one platform and the trains on the lines to [[Strausberg station|Strausberg]], [[Ahrensfelde station|Ahrensfelde]] and [[Wartenberg station|Wartenberg]] via [[Berlin-Lichtenberg station|Lichtenberg]] stopped at another. Since the reconstruction, the two lower platforms have been served by train running in the same direction to allow easy interchange (known as ''Richtungsbetrieb''\u2014directional operation). The northern platform is served by all trains running towards the city centre, while the southern platform is used by trains running in the opposite direction. The track from Erkner crosses the track to Lichtenberg on a bridge to the east of the platforms. The Ringbahn S-Bahn platform was rebuilt at the old location, but it is now much wider and has been given a [[train shed]]. There is now no platform at the connecting curve from the southern Ringbahn to Stadtbahn, which is used by line S9 from [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]].\n\nRegional platforms were built on the low-level part of the station on both the Silesian Railway (south of the S-Bahn) for trains running east\u2013west and the Eastern Railway (north of the S-Bahn). In addition, a regional platform was built on the Ringbahn in the high-level part of the station.\n\nProvision has been made for a tunnel section under the tracks of the Stadtbahn for the planned extension of [[Bundesautobahn 100|autobahn 100]] (Berlin city ring, 17th&nbsp;construction phase). It is 130 metres long and consists of a 3000&nbsp;m\u00b2 reinforced concrete slab resting on 20 to 30 metres deep [[diaphragm wall]]s. This would allow an actual motorway tunnel to be built later without further interference with rail traffic.<ref name=\"blz-2012-03-17\">{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/autobahn-100-am-ostkreuz-entstehen-erste-teile-der-a-100,10809148,11914406.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321230951/http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/autobahn-100-am-ostkreuz-entstehen-erste-teile-der-a-100,10809148,11914406.html|archivedate=21 March 2012|title=Am Ostkreuz entstehen erste Teile der A&nbsp;100 |newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |date= 17 March 2012|accessdate=24 July 2019|language=de}}</ref>\n \nThe [[Trams in Berlin|tramway]] that now runs through Boxhagener Stra\u00dfe will in future run directly to Ostkreuz and stop in the northern area under the platform of the Ringbahn.<ref name=\"db-umbau\">{{cite book |title=Umbau der Bahnh\u00f6fe Ostkreuz und Warschauer Stra\u00dfe |publisher=Deutsche Bahn |language=German}} (brochure)</ref> The aim is to shorten transfer times and to provide direct access for feeder traffic from the surrounding residential areas.\n\n====Construction process====\n[[File:Bahnhof Berlin Ostkreuz Baustelle April 2011.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Ringbahn train shed, April 2011]]\n[[File:Berlin Ostkreuz Panorama 2013-05-08.jpg|thumb|Platform D on the last day of operation, 8&nbsp;May 2013]]\n[[File:Ostkreuz Baustelle S\u00fcdringkurve P1040856.JPG|thumb|South curve construction, July 2015]]\n[[File:Bahnhof Berlin Ostkreuz November 2018.jpg|thumb|Condition in November 2018]]\nPre-construction work began in the spring and summer of 2006 with the demolition of old buildings and the removal of vegetation.

There were also platforms on the long-distance tracks of the Silesian Railway and the Eastern Railway, which separated to the east of the station. Presumably, there was an island platform on the northern track and an intermediate platform on the southern track. In addition, there was a freight track of the Eastern Railway to the north and a freight track of the Silesian Railway to the south of the remaining tracks.\n \nAt the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century, the long-distance and suburban railways were separated by the Eastern Railway and the Silesian Railway. The lower platforms D and E on the routes to Lichtenberg and Erkner and the upper Ringbahn platform F date back to this time. The tracks of the upper platforms (A, B, C and F) were about six metres above the level of the lower platforms (D and E).{{sfn|Rosenke|Demps|1987|pp=15\u201327}}\n \nThe long-distance tracks of the Silesian Railway were built south of the lower platforms, and were not provided with a platform in Ostkreuz. The long-distance tracks of the Ringbahn are located east of the S-Bahn platform. Before the rebuilding there were in addition to the two long-distance tracks still connections to the brake plant in Stralau and the Osthafen (East Harbour). The siding to the harbour crossed the tracks of the Ringbahn in a tunnel to the south of the station.\n\n====Platform A====\n[[File:Berlin-zentrum-by-RalfR-002.jpg|thumb|Platform A has since been demolished]]\nThis platform was in operation from 1882 to 2009 with a few reconstructions. This triangular platform was on an embankment west of platforms D and E between the curved lines connecting the Stadtbahn with the Ringbahn. The platform canopy was supported by one-piece, riveted steel girders.<ref name=\"ldl09095164\"/> Trains from the Stadtbahn to the northern Ringbahn stopped on the northern side of the platform and trains from the southern Ringbahn to the Stadtbahn stopped on the southern side. Scheduled passenger traffic to the north ended in 1994, although until 2006 there were still occasional special and diverted services. Operations on the southern side of the platform ended on 28 August 2009.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\"/> The curve to the southern Ringbahn was removed for the station reconstruction and later rebuilt without a platform.\n\nOriginally ramps ran from the Simplonstra\u00dfe in the north and the Markgrafendamm in the south to the platform and the later entrance building. With the construction of the pedestrian bridge and the two entrance buildings in Sonntagstra\u00dfe and Markgrafendamm, the platform was accessible from the bridge via branches off it. After the destruction of the bridges, the platform was accessible only by stairs from platforms D and E.\n\n====Platforms B and C====\nThe S-Bahn platforms were located on the outsides of the connecting curves. Platform B was on the track connecting the Stadtbahn to the northern Ringbahn, while platform C was on the southern curve connecting towards Treptower Park. They were connected to platform A by a short tunnel.\n\nPlatform C was built in 1895/1896 for the [[Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin|Berlin trade exposition]] in Treptower Park.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" /> It was taken out of service on 12 April 1966 due to disrepair,<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" /> as was platform&nbsp;B in the same year. Trains running towards the southern ring and from the northern ring then ran without stopping, while trains running in the respective opposite directions continued to stop at platform&nbsp;A.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" /> Platform B was demolished in 1970, as was platform C in November 1978.<ref name=\"punkt3-23-2017-sk\" />\n\n====Platform D====\nThe S-Bahn platform was at ground level on the S-Bahn tracks of the Eastern Railway running from the Stadtbahn in the east to Lichtenberg in the west. It lay between the wedge-shaped platform &nbsp;A in the east and the Ringbahn platform&nbsp;F in the west, with no platforms on top of each other. Due to the spreading of the tracks from Lichtenberg to accommodate the connecting curves from the Ringbahn the platform was unusually wide. The station building, which stood at its western end, was destroyed in 1945.\n \nThe original canopy of platform&nbsp;D was supported by one-piece, riveted steel girders.<ref name=\"ldl09095164\" /> Platform&nbsp;D was taken out of service on 8&nbsp;May 2013 and was subsequently replaced by a new building.\n\n====Platform E====\n[[File:S-Bahnsteig Ostkreuz mit Kiosk 2007.jpg|thumb|Plarform E, 2007]]\nThis S-Bahn platform is also located at street level and parallel to platform D on the S-Bahn tracks of the Silesian Railway to/from Erkner. To the west the tracks connect to the Stadtbahn. The original platform roof was supported by paired columns of [[cast iron]] in [[Jugendstil]] design.<ref name=\"ldl09095164\" /> It was taken out of service in July 2014 and was subsequently replaced by a new structure.\n\n====Platform F====\nThis S-Bahn platform of the Ringbahn was originally located on a bridge over the tracks of the Stadtbahn and was orientated north\u2013south. \nThe original platform roof was supported by paired columns of cast iron in Jugendstil design.<ref name=\"ldl09095164\" /> The platform was demolished after the opening of the regional platform in 2009 and replaced in the following years by a new structure.\n\n===Platforms after the reconstruction===\n[[File:Ostkreuz-Bahnhhof.jpg|thumb|Ostkreuz station, 2018]]\nThe new lower platforms&nbsp;D and&nbsp;E are clearly shifted to the east and partly run under the platforms of the Ringbahn, but are well separated from the connecting curve, which was also given no platform for this reason. The S-Bahn platform on the Ringbahn was rebuilt in about the old location. The station is supplemented by several new Regionalbahn services.\n\n====Platform D====\nThe new platform&nbsp;D is a platform for west-running services for trains from Erkner and Lichtenberg towards the city center. The observation shed and the platform canopy were rebuilt on the basis of the historic shape of the old platform&nbsp;D. It was opened in October 2014 for trains running towards Lichtenberg only. Trains running towards  the city center have stopped there since August 2017.\n\n====Platform E====\nS-Bahn trains running to the eastern suburbs have stopped at the new platform&nbsp;E since August 2017.<ref name=\"punkt3-19-2017\" /> The observation shed and the platform canopy here were also rebuilt in the style of the old platform.\n\n====Platform F====\n[[File:Berlin - S-Bahnhof Ostkreuz - Neue Ringbahnhalle - Stand 04 2012 (6976652160).jpg|thumb|Ringbahn hall, 2012]]\n \nThe S-Bahn platform of the Ringbahn was built in a similar position as its predecessor, but significantly wider.

It was destroyed during the Second World War.{{sfn|Meyer-Kronthaler|Kramer|1998|p=299}} Its location was still visible on the west side of platform&nbsp;D, which is unusually wide in this area.\nSmall access buildings were later built at the entrances from Sonntagsstra\u00dfe and Markgrafendamm.\n\n===Pedestrian bridge===\n\nThe covered pedestrian bridge, built according to the plans of Richard Brademann in 1923 and 1926,<ref name=\"punkt3-2016-15\" /> connected to platforms&nbsp;D and&nbsp;E close to their western end and had exits to Hauptstra\u00dfe and to Sonntagstra\u00dfe. Originally there was also a direct connection from the bridge over a pier to platform&nbsp;A, which was destroyed during the Second World War.\nIn the course of the station renovation, the bridge was demolished and replaced by a temporary pedestrian bridge. From April 2016 to December 2018, a new structure was built at the same place as a replica of the original bridge with additional connections to the newly added platforms Rn2 and Ru including preserved historical bridge supports and lattice girders in the area of platform&nbsp;D. The staircases and the supports and abutments were built in reinforced concrete, along with the Sonntagstra\u00dfe staircase, which is to be provided with a toilet block on the ground floor. The windows were built to reflect the historical design, but in metal with safety glazing that will meet current standards. The superstructure is covered with asphalt and the steps with natural stone.\nThe first part of the newly constructed bridge went into operation on 3 September 2017, initially as a connection from Hauptstra\u00dfe to platforms E and D. The connection to platform Ru was opened at the timetable change in December 2017.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Kurzmeldungen&nbsp;\u2013 S-Bahn |journal =[[Berliner Verkehrsbl\u00e4tter]] |issue=10 |date=2017 |p=202|language=de}}</ref> The second part of the bridge to Sonntagstra\u00dfe went into operation in December 2018.\n \nAnother pedestrian overpass ran alongside the tracks of the connecting curves from Sonntagstra\u00dfe past platform&nbsp;A and the old entrance building to Markgrafendamm. In contrast to the other pedestrian bridge, it served mainly as a link between the urban areas on both sides and was outside the controlled access area of the station, so it was usable for travellers without tickets.

This was built from 1909 to 1912 to the design of Karl Cornelius  and served to supply water to the many steam locomotives running from Ostkreuz. Its round trunk is veneered with bricks that are glazed violet. A cylindrical pressure-resistant water tank sits on this; it holds 400 cubic metres and is fully integrated with the roof. The steep pitched roof and the slated polygonal dome exhibit the influence of [[Art Nouveau]]. The water tower is now a symbol of Ostkreuz and a highly visible building. It is listed as a monument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&KEY=obj%2009095165 |title=Heritage listing: Wasserturm |publisher=Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt |date=10 April 2014|accessdate=26 July 2019 |language=de}}</ref>\n\n===Rail officials' house ===\n==== Northern officials' residence (Sonntagstra\u00dfe 37) ====\n[[File:Berlin Ostkreuz - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Northern officials' residence at Sonntagstra\u00dfe 37]]\n[[File:EisenbahnerwohnhausMarkgrafendamm.jpg|thumb|Southern officials' residence at Markgrafendamm 24a]]\nA two-storey residence for railway officials with a [[hipped roof]] was built in 1910 in the triangle between the curve to the north Ringbahn, the Stadtbahn and the Ringbahn.

It was released worldwide for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on February 23, 2016, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] on March 1, 2016. The game is a spin-off of the main ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. It is the first ''Far Cry'' game set in pre-modern times. It revolves around the story of Takkar, who starts off as an unarmed hunter and rises to become the leader of a tribe.\n\n''Far Cry Primal'' received generally positive reception from critics, who mostly praised the concept and setting, as well as the animal-taming mechanic and world design. Some reviewers felt there was a lack of weapons for the player to utilize, leading to repetitive gameplay design, while others felt the story and characters were not on par with the previous ''Far Cry'' games.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Far Cry Primal (2016) - Screenshot (Tame).jpg|left|thumb|In ''Far Cry Primal'', the player has the ability to tame animals for use in combat.]]\n''Far Cry Primal'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. As the game is set in prehistoric times, the traditional gunplay and vehicle gameplay featured in the [[Far Cry|''Far Cry'' series]] were removed,<ref name=\"GRadar1\"/> and the player can only get access to melee weapons such as spears, clubs and ranged weapons such as bows and slings.<ref name=\"GI\"/> The player cannot purchase weapons and must craft them using the materials scavenged in the world such as wood and stone. As the player progresses, they can craft more lethal weapons with a larger variety of resources. \n\nBesides facing natural predators, the player must also compete with other hostile tribes occupying the area. By attacking and seizing bonfires and camps, the Wenja tribe will move in and begin patrolling the nearby region, and the player will gain fast travel points as well as camps to rest in. [[Non-player characters]] will also task the player to rescue tribe-mates and perform other tasks which improve the village, as well as provide free crafting materials. The game also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle, which affects the gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-primal-officially-unveiled-coming-in-early-2016/|title=Far Cry Primal officially unveiled, coming in early 2016|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref> At night, more predators are present, and many become more aggressive and dangerous, whereas at the day, the player can gather food and scavenge other resources such as tools for hunting.

Resigned to proceed alone, Takkar meets Sayla (Cara Ricketts), a Wenja gatherer whose life he saves, and once they arrive at Oros, Sayla informs Takkar that the Wenja are scattered and homeless across the land after their village was destroyed by Ull (DeLaRosa Rivera), leader of the [[Neanderthal]]-like Udam tribe who live in the northern mountains, prize warfare and hunting, and frequently kidnap Wenja to cannibalize them. Takkar then starts gathering the Wenja he meets around his cave, eventually encountering the wolf [[shaman]] Tensay ([[Terrence C. Carson]]), who helps him to learn the ability to tame the local animals. Tensay dubs Takkar the \"Beast Master\" for his skill.\n\nAfter repelling an Udam attack led by Ull on his newly established village, Takkar enlists the help of three other skilled Wenja: Jayma ([[Ayisha Issa]]), a veteran huntress, Wogah (Ron Kennell), a one-armed craftsman, and Karoosh (Nicolas Van Burek), a one-eyed warrior with his own vendetta against the Udam. With the help of Tensay, Takkar discovers that the Udam are eating Wenja flesh in hopes of gaining immunity from a terminal genetic disease, the \"skull fire\", that is wiping out their tribe, then tracks down and apprehends the Udam commander Dah (Juan Carlos Velis) to learn more about the Udam's techniques. Several Wenja reject Takkar's decision to give shelter to an Udam warrior at first, and take him to a cave to be executed by drowning, until Takkar himself arrives in time to rescue Dah and chastise the tribe for disobeying him, earning Dah's gratitude and help. When the agrarian, ritualistic Izila, another, more advanced tribe that lives in the marshlands of southern Oros, begin capturing Wenja prisoners for slavery and human sacrifice to the Sun goddess Suxli, Takkar invades their domains to rescue them, coming face to face with their leader Batari ([[Debra Wilson]]). After he refuses to become Batari's slave, a war begins between the Wenja and Izila. Takkar then infiltrates the camp of an Izila commander named Roshani (Ali Momen) and captures him, allowing him to live in exchange for sharing Izila technology in both warfare and agriculture.\n\nAfter preparing himself enough to face Ull and Batari, Takkar storms the Udam and Izila's main fortresses, passing by all opposition before confronting and killing their commanders. While the defiant Batari is burned alive during a solar eclipse, Ull urges Takkar to take care of his two children with his dying breath, which Takkar accepts, taking them with him back to his village. With both rival tribes defeated and Wenja dominance secured, Roshani agrees to stay with the Wenja and teach them how to grow food, while Takkar reluctantly agrees to mercifully kill Dah, ending his suffering from disease. Takkar then joins Sayla and Tensay in a celebration of his victory with the other villagers.\n\nIn the post-credits, Ull's daughter appears taming a cave bear, implying that she has acquired Takkar's animal taming skills.\n\n== Development ==\nThe development of ''Far Cry Primal'' was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], with assistance provided by [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Kiev]] and [[Ubisoft Shanghai]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> When asked about whether ''[[Far Cry 4]]'' would feature standalone content like ''[[Far Cry 3]]'' with ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon|Blood Dragon]]'', creative director Alex Hutchinson declared that a sequel to the game would not be happening, however they are planning something that can \"surprise\" players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blood-dragon-2-not-happening-says-far-cry-4-dev/1100-6423477/|title=Blood Dragon 2 Not Happening, Says Far Cry 4 Dev|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref> On January 5, 2015, Ubisoft released a survey and asked players about their favorite ''Far Cry'' setting.

He also felt that the animal companion mechanic was one of the game's strongest elements, saying that it has \"limitless potential\". In regard to the choice of setting, he felt it was a welcome and natural evolution in the ''Far Cry'' series. However, he described the story as being familiar and predictable and said that, even with the drastic change of setting, the ''Far Cry'' formula isn't as innovative as it once was.<ref name=\"Destructoid review\"/>\n\nMatt Buchholtz of [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] wrote, \"The graphics are stunning\u2014Ubisoft has truly mastered facial animations and lighting effects.\" He added, \"The game feels like a full-priced reskin of ''Far Cry 4'', without the engaging storyline\", finishing with, \"''Far Cry Primal'' really wants you to know that there are tons of things you can do in its prehistoric, open world. Unfortunately, you may not want to do any of them.\"<ref name=\"EGM review\"/>\n\nJeff Cork from [[Game Informer]] praised the setting for allowing for gameplay and story elements with more realism, specifically in regard to the protagonist not being a stereotype young male who inexplicably has advanced combat knowledge. He called the visuals and world design \"beautiful\", and said that the decision to use a primitive language made specifically for the game was \"effective\". Lastly, Cork wrote: \"Players who associate ''Far Cry'' with explosions and massive gunfights might find the setting disappointing, but it's one of my favorite entries in the series yet.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer review\"/>\n\nMatt Utley of [[Game Revolution]] called ''Far Cry Primal'' a \"breath of fresh air for both the franchise and first-person action games in general\". He praised the decision to remove guns and motorized vehicles for enabling more dynamic gameplay, called the graphics \"lush\" and \"evocative\", and, like others, commended the bold setting change. Utley's critiques were minor; he disliked some aspects of the control scheme, found that the quieter moments of the game were drowned-out by aggressive enemies, and felt that not enough improvements and fixes were made to the basic ''Far Cry'' formula.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/>\n\nMike Mahardy of [[GameSpot]] gave the game a mostly positive review, calling the setting its greatest strength. He praised the open world for being \"cohesive\" and \"foreboding\", enjoyed the \"tense\" focus on survival, and called the beast-taming mechanics \"creative\". Mahardy did feel as though there was a limited amount of weapons given to the player and disliked some of the gameplay for being \"repetitive\".<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/>\n\nJoe Skrebels from [[GamesRadar]] was more critical of the game, summarizing his thoughts with: \"''Primal'' takes the great structure of the ''Far Cry'' series, but little of its character. No clear goal and a limited arsenal end up making this feel a little prehistoric itself.\" Skrebels too praised the taming mechanic and the open world design.<ref name=\"GamesRadar review\"/>\n\nLuke Reilly of [[IGN]] summarized his review with: \"''Far Cry Primal'' comes to the table with a quiver of neat ideas but it forgot to bring much of a story with it.\" Reilly thought the game's strongest aspects were created by its twist on the series' formula, highlighting the scavenging elements and the animal-taming mechanics. However, Reilly felt the drastic change for the series wasn't without its flaws, saying that the characters, quests, and overall story were a step back from the memorable moments of the previous games.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s [[Justin McElroy]] particularly praised the open world environment, calling it the \"most immersive\" in the series. He summarized his review by writing: \"I don't want every ''Far Cry'' game from here on to trade bullets for arrows, motorcycles for tigers, but ''Primal'' is an invigorating example of how to re-imagine a tired franchise while keeping its soul intact.\"<ref name=\"Polygon review\"/>\n\nEven though he described the game as being \"very fun\" and felt that the decision to develop a spin-off-type game in the series was a great one, Simon Miller from VideoGamer.com recognized that ''Far Cry Primal'' \"doesn't do anything drastically new\" for the series. He too praised the animal taming mechanic and the visuals.<ref name=\"VideoGamer.com review\"/>\n\n=== Sales ===\nThe retail version was the best selling game in its week of release in the UK, debuting at No. 1 in the UK retail software sales chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-primal-conquers-uk-sales-chart/1100-6435171/|title=Far Cry Primal Conquers UK Sales Chart|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 29, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> It was also the best-selling game in the United States in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-ten-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-february-/1100-6435545/|title=Top Ten Best-Selling Games in the US for February 2016|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref> According to Ubisoft, the game performed better than they had expected, and that its release became the biggest launch of a game in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/12/11664974/the-division-far-cry-primal-ubisoft-sales-performance|title=The Division hits 9.5M players while Far Cry Primal sets a February sales record (update)|first=Samit|last=Sarker|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n*{{Official website|http://far-cry.ubisoft.com/primal/en-us/home/}}\n\n{{Far Cry series}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Far Cry]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Hunting video games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric people in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Jason Graves]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n[[Category:Video games set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Europe]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Far Cry Primal \n| image = Far Cry Primal cover art.jpg\n| developer = [[Ubisoft Montreal]]{{efn|Additional work by [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Shanghai]] and [[Ubisoft Kiev]].}}\n| publisher = [[Ubisoft]]\n| director = {{Unbulleted list|Jean-Christophe Guyot|Thomas Simon}}\n| producer = Vincent Pontbriand\n| programmer = {{Unbulleted list|David Robillard|Jean-Philippe Harvey}}\n| artist = Mickael Labat\n| writer = {{Unbulleted list|Jean-S\u00e9bastien Decant|Ian Ryan|Kevin Shortt}}\n| composer = [[Jason Graves]]\n| series = ''[[Far Cry]]''\n| engine =\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[PlayStation 4]]|[[Xbox One]]|[[Microsoft Windows]]}}\n| released = {{Unbulleted list|'''PlayStation 4''', '''Xbox One'''|February 23, 2016|'''Microsoft Windows'''|March 1, 2016}}\n| genre = [[First-person shooter]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''Far Cry Primal''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. It was released worldwide for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on February 23, 2016, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] on March 1, 2016. The game is a spin-off of the main ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. It is the first ''Far Cry'' game set in pre-modern times. It revolves around the story of Takkar, who starts off as an unarmed hunter and rises to become the leader of a tribe.\n\n''Far Cry Primal'' received generally positive reception from critics, who mostly praised the concept and setting, as well as the animal-taming mechanic and world design. Some reviewers felt there was a lack of weapons for the player to utilize, leading to repetitive gameplay design, while others felt the story and characters were not on par with the previous ''Far Cry'' games.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Far Cry Primal (2016) - Screenshot (Tame).jpg|left|thumb|In ''Far Cry Primal'', the player has the ability to tame animals for use in combat.]]\n''Far Cry Primal'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].

By attacking and seizing bonfires and camps, the Wenja tribe will move in and begin patrolling the nearby region, and the player will gain fast travel points as well as camps to rest in. [[Non-player characters]] will also task the player to rescue tribe-mates and perform other tasks which improve the village, as well as provide free crafting materials.

Resigned to proceed alone, Takkar meets Sayla (Cara Ricketts), a Wenja gatherer whose life he saves, and once they arrive at Oros, Sayla informs Takkar that the Wenja are scattered and homeless across the land after their village was destroyed by Ull (DeLaRosa Rivera), leader of the [[Neanderthal]]-like Udam tribe who live in the northern mountains, prize warfare and hunting, and frequently kidnap Wenja to cannibalize them. Takkar then starts gathering the Wenja he meets around his cave, eventually encountering the wolf [[shaman]] Tensay ([[Terrence C. Carson]]), who helps him to learn the ability to tame the local animals. Tensay dubs Takkar the \"Beast Master\" for his skill.\n\nAfter repelling an Udam attack led by Ull on his newly established village, Takkar enlists the help of three other skilled Wenja: Jayma ([[Ayisha Issa]]), a veteran huntress, Wogah (Ron Kennell), a one-armed craftsman, and Karoosh (Nicolas Van Burek), a one-eyed warrior with his own vendetta against the Udam. With the help of Tensay, Takkar discovers that the Udam are eating Wenja flesh in hopes of gaining immunity from a terminal genetic disease, the \"skull fire\", that is wiping out their tribe, then tracks down and apprehends the Udam commander Dah (Juan Carlos Velis) to learn more about the Udam's techniques. Several Wenja reject Takkar's decision to give shelter to an Udam warrior at first, and take him to a cave to be executed by drowning, until Takkar himself arrives in time to rescue Dah and chastise the tribe for disobeying him, earning Dah's gratitude and help. When the agrarian, ritualistic Izila, another, more advanced tribe that lives in the marshlands of southern Oros, begin capturing Wenja prisoners for slavery and human sacrifice to the Sun goddess Suxli, Takkar invades their domains to rescue them, coming face to face with their leader Batari ([[Debra Wilson]]). After he refuses to become Batari's slave, a war begins between the Wenja and Izila. Takkar then infiltrates the camp of an Izila commander named Roshani (Ali Momen) and captures him, allowing him to live in exchange for sharing Izila technology in both warfare and agriculture.\n\nAfter preparing himself enough to face Ull and Batari, Takkar storms the Udam and Izila's main fortresses, passing by all opposition before confronting and killing their commanders. While the defiant Batari is burned alive during a solar eclipse, Ull urges Takkar to take care of his two children with his dying breath, which Takkar accepts, taking them with him back to his village. With both rival tribes defeated and Wenja dominance secured, Roshani agrees to stay with the Wenja and teach them how to grow food, while Takkar reluctantly agrees to mercifully kill Dah, ending his suffering from disease. Takkar then joins Sayla and Tensay in a celebration of his victory with the other villagers.\n\nIn the post-credits, Ull's daughter appears taming a cave bear, implying that she has acquired Takkar's animal taming skills.\n\n== Development ==\nThe development of ''Far Cry Primal'' was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], with assistance provided by [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Kiev]] and [[Ubisoft Shanghai]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> When asked about whether ''[[Far Cry 4]]'' would feature standalone content like ''[[Far Cry 3]]'' with ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon|Blood Dragon]]'', creative director Alex Hutchinson declared that a sequel to the game would not be happening, however they are planning something that can \"surprise\" players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blood-dragon-2-not-happening-says-far-cry-4-dev/1100-6423477/|title=Blood Dragon 2 Not Happening, Says Far Cry 4 Dev|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref> On January 5, 2015, Ubisoft released a survey and asked players about their favorite ''Far Cry'' setting.

He also felt that the animal companion mechanic was one of the game's strongest elements, saying that it has \"limitless potential\". In regard to the choice of setting, he felt it was a welcome and natural evolution in the ''Far Cry'' series. However, he described the story as being familiar and predictable and said that, even with the drastic change of setting, the ''Far Cry'' formula isn't as innovative as it once was.<ref name=\"Destructoid review\"/>\n\nMatt Buchholtz of [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] wrote, \"The graphics are stunning\u2014Ubisoft has truly mastered facial animations and lighting effects.\" He added, \"The game feels like a full-priced reskin of ''Far Cry 4'', without the engaging storyline\", finishing with, \"''Far Cry Primal'' really wants you to know that there are tons of things you can do in its prehistoric, open world. Unfortunately, you may not want to do any of them.\"<ref name=\"EGM review\"/>\n\nJeff Cork from [[Game Informer]] praised the setting for allowing for gameplay and story elements with more realism, specifically in regard to the protagonist not being a stereotype young male who inexplicably has advanced combat knowledge. He called the visuals and world design \"beautiful\", and said that the decision to use a primitive language made specifically for the game was \"effective\". Lastly, Cork wrote: \"Players who associate ''Far Cry'' with explosions and massive gunfights might find the setting disappointing, but it's one of my favorite entries in the series yet.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer review\"/>\n\nMatt Utley of [[Game Revolution]] called ''Far Cry Primal'' a \"breath of fresh air for both the franchise and first-person action games in general\". He praised the decision to remove guns and motorized vehicles for enabling more dynamic gameplay, called the graphics \"lush\" and \"evocative\", and, like others, commended the bold setting change. Utley's critiques were minor; he disliked some aspects of the control scheme, found that the quieter moments of the game were drowned-out by aggressive enemies, and felt that not enough improvements and fixes were made to the basic ''Far Cry'' formula.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/>\n\nMike Mahardy of [[GameSpot]] gave the game a mostly positive review, calling the setting its greatest strength. He praised the open world for being \"cohesive\" and \"foreboding\", enjoyed the \"tense\" focus on survival, and called the beast-taming mechanics \"creative\". Mahardy did feel as though there was a limited amount of weapons given to the player and disliked some of the gameplay for being \"repetitive\".<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/>\n\nJoe Skrebels from [[GamesRadar]] was more critical of the game, summarizing his thoughts with: \"''Primal'' takes the great structure of the ''Far Cry'' series, but little of its character. No clear goal and a limited arsenal end up making this feel a little prehistoric itself.\" Skrebels too praised the taming mechanic and the open world design.<ref name=\"GamesRadar review\"/>\n\nLuke Reilly of [[IGN]] summarized his review with: \"''Far Cry Primal'' comes to the table with a quiver of neat ideas but it forgot to bring much of a story with it.\" Reilly thought the game's strongest aspects were created by its twist on the series' formula, highlighting the scavenging elements and the animal-taming mechanics. However, Reilly felt the drastic change for the series wasn't without its flaws, saying that the characters, quests, and overall story were a step back from the memorable moments of the previous games.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s [[Justin McElroy]] particularly praised the open world environment, calling it the \"most immersive\" in the series. He summarized his review by writing: \"I don't want every ''Far Cry'' game from here on to trade bullets for arrows, motorcycles for tigers, but ''Primal'' is an invigorating example of how to re-imagine a tired franchise while keeping its soul intact.\"<ref name=\"Polygon review\"/>\n\nEven though he described the game as being \"very fun\" and felt that the decision to develop a spin-off-type game in the series was a great one, Simon Miller from VideoGamer.com recognized that ''Far Cry Primal'' \"doesn't do anything drastically new\" for the series. He too praised the animal taming mechanic and the visuals.<ref name=\"VideoGamer.com review\"/>\n\n=== Sales ===\nThe retail version was the best selling game in its week of release in the UK, debuting at No. 1 in the UK retail software sales chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-primal-conquers-uk-sales-chart/1100-6435171/|title=Far Cry Primal Conquers UK Sales Chart|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 29, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> It was also the best-selling game in the United States in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-ten-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-february-/1100-6435545/|title=Top Ten Best-Selling Games in the US for February 2016|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref> According to Ubisoft, the game performed better than they had expected, and that its release became the biggest launch of a game in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/12/11664974/the-division-far-cry-primal-ubisoft-sales-performance|title=The Division hits 9.5M players while Far Cry Primal sets a February sales record (update)|first=Samit|last=Sarker|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n*{{Official website|http://far-cry.ubisoft.com/primal/en-us/home/}}\n\n{{Far Cry series}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Far Cry]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Hunting video games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric people in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Jason Graves]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n[[Category:Video games set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Europe]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "name_user": "222.153.94.84", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_Primal"}
