It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was J.T. Walsh's final performance and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers David and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow, popular and outgoing, while the introverted David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950\u2019s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David\u2019s knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers\u2019 living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television, but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show\u2019s characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town \u2013 fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion and foreign concepts such as books, fire and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces sex to her peers, many of her classmates go to Lover's Lane to engage in sex, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill\u2019s interest in painting. After learning of sex and [[masturbation]] from Jennifer, Betty pleasures herself while bathing and, upon reaching orgasm, sees color and eventually becomes \"colored\" herself. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged, led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville\u2019s values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill\u2019s nude painting of Betty, done on his malt shop window. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is nearly raped by non-colored teenage boys. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his twin sister, his new girlfriend and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.

It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was J.T. Walsh's final performance and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers David and his twin sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow, popular and outgoing, while the introverted David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950\u2019s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David\u2019s knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers\u2019 living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television, but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show\u2019s characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town \u2013 fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school but has sex with him, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion and foreign concepts such as books, fire and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces sex to her peers, many of her classmates go to Lover's Lane to engage in sex, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill\u2019s interest in painting. After learning of sex and [[masturbation]] from Jennifer, Betty pleasures herself while bathing and, upon reaching orgasm, sees color and eventually becomes \"colored\" herself. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged, led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville\u2019s values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill\u2019s nude painting of Betty, done on his malt shop window. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]], and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is nearly raped by non-colored teenage boys. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his twin sister, his new girlfriend and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.

ABC ran a remake known as '''''[[V (2009 TV series)|V: The 2009 TV series]]''''' which ran for two seasons for 22 episodes from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the original series the title refers to the [[V sign#The V for Victory campaign and the victory-freedom sign|\"V for Victory\" sign]]. In the 1983 ''V'' miniseries, a group of children are shown spray painting generic graffiti over the Visitors' propaganda posters, but are then shown how to spray the V over the posters by Abraham Bernstein, a [[Holocaust]] survivor, who explains the meaning of the sign to them as he defaces the first poster. In the 2009 reboot of the series, however, ''V'' is used within the show as an abbreviation for the Visitors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | title=\"V\" IS FOR VICTORY, NOT FOR VISITORS! | publisher=visitorsamongus.com | accessdate=2011-01-22 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105103304/http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | archivedate=2011-01-05 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=V is for Visitors \u2014 and Victory | url=http://www.tvtyrant.com/2009/08/11/v-is-for-visitors-%E2%80%94-and-victory/ | accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/08/14021/ | title=Lost\u2019s Elizabeth Mitchell Fights Aliens in V Reboot | work=Wired.com | date=2009-08-11 | accessdate=2011-01-22 | quote='Propaganda has just become advertising' in modern society, [2009 series producer Jeffrey] Bell said.

Series creator Kenneth Johnson has said that the story was inspired by the 1935 novel ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]].<ref>Copp, Dan. Fascist Lizards from Outer Space: The Politics, Literary Influences and Cultural History of Kenneth Johnson\u2019s V. McFarland, 2017, page 21.</ref> In a commentary track on the [[DVD]] release of the first miniseries, Johnson reveals that ''V'' was originally intended as a straightforward political thriller, charting the rise of a fascist movement in the United States. NBC was interested in a sci-fi hit, to capitalize on the success of films such as the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy.\n\nThe miniseries was successful enough to spawn a sequel, ''V: The Final Battle'', which was meant to conclude the story, and also a television series in 1984\u20131985 that continued it. Johnson left the franchise during production of ''The Final Battle''. The cancellation of the TV series in the spring of 1985 meant that the season ends with a cliffhanger. The TV series' single season was released on Region 1 DVD in 2004. The series was remade in 2009.\n\n==Film==\nOn February 6, 2018, the reincarnated Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of ''V''. The film would be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added \"We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless\u2014and timely\u2014story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st Century&nbsp;...

Five were originally planned but the range soon extended beyond these. The first was a novelization of the first two miniseries combined into one story, originally planned as 2 books, Pinnacle later changed their minds during its writing, and decreed that it should be one book (The publishers were then left with the option of another book, this became ''East Coast Crisis'')  Because the Writers guide was not ready in time for the authors to consult, most of the original novels that followed did not feature characters or continuing storylines from the TV series, but rather focused on battles against the alien invaders in other parts of the world, some were also set during the \"unrecorded year\" between the end of \"The Final Battle\" and \"Liberation day\" to get around this problem.\n\nWhile the series was on the air, new novels were published once a month by [[Pinnacle Paperbacks]], and in the U.K. every 2 months by [[New English Library]].  In 1987\u201388, the remaining 5 books, left unpublished with the demise of Pinnacle books, were published by Tor.

ABC ran a remake known as '''''[[V (2009 TV series)|V: The 2009 TV series]]''''' which ran for two seasons for 22 episodes from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn the original series the title refers to the [[V sign#The V for Victory campaign and the victory-freedom sign|\"V for Victory\" sign]]. In the 1983 ''V'' miniseries, a group of children are shown spray painting generic graffiti over the Visitors' propaganda posters, but are then shown how to spray the V over the posters by Abraham Bernstein, a [[Holocaust]] survivor, who explains the meaning of the sign to them as he defaces the first poster. In the 2009 reboot of the series, however, ''V'' is used within the show as an abbreviation for the Visitors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | title=\"V\" IS FOR VICTORY, NOT FOR VISITORS! | publisher=visitorsamongus.com | accessdate=2011-01-22 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105103304/http://www.visitorsamongus.com/2009/11/v-is-for-victory-not-for-visitors.html | archivedate=2011-01-05 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=V is for Visitors \u2014 and Victory | url=http://www.tvtyrant.com/2009/08/11/v-is-for-visitors-%E2%80%94-and-victory/ | accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/08/14021/ | title=Lost\u2019s Elizabeth Mitchell Fights Aliens in V Reboot | work=Wired.com | date=2009-08-11 | accessdate=2011-01-22 | quote='Propaganda has just become advertising' in modern society, [2009 series producer Jeffrey] Bell said.

Johnson's novel ''[[V (The Second Generation)|V: The Second Generation]]'', an alternative sequel to the first miniseries which disregards ''V: The Final Battle'' and ''V: The Series'', (because of his non-involvement with them) was released on February 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html |title=V History |publisher=Kennethjohnson.us |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Johnson stated he was in negotiations for a TV adaptation of his sequel novel, but in October 2008, [[Warner Bros. Television]] announced they were producing a complete [[remake]] of ''V'' instead.  This [[V (2009 TV series)|new ''V'' series]] ran for two truncated seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], from November 3, 2009, to March 15, 2011.\n\n==Television==\n* ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'' miniseries (1983)\n* ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]'' sequel miniseries (1984)\n* ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'' ongoing series (1984\u20131985)\n* ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'' reboot series (2009\u20132011)\n\nThe original miniseries debuted in the United States on [[NBC]] on May 1, 1983. Series creator Kenneth Johnson has said that the story was inspired by the 1935 novel ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]].<ref>Copp, Dan. Fascist Lizards from Outer Space: The Politics, Literary Influences and Cultural History of Kenneth Johnson\u2019s V. McFarland, 2017, page 21.</ref> In a commentary track on the [[DVD]] release of the first miniseries, Johnson reveals that ''V'' was originally intended as a straightforward political thriller, charting the rise of a fascist movement in the United States. NBC was interested in a sci-fi hit, to capitalize on the success of films such as the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy.\n\nThe miniseries was successful enough to spawn a sequel, ''V: The Final Battle'', which was meant to conclude the story, and also a television series in 1984\u20131985 that continued it. Johnson left the franchise during production of ''The Final Battle''. The cancellation of the TV series in the spring of 1985 meant that the season ends with a cliffhanger. The TV series' single season was released on Region 1 DVD in 2004. The series was remade in 2009.\n\n==Film==\nOn February 6, 2018, the reincarnated Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of ''V''. The film would be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added \"We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless\u2014and timely\u2014story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st Century&nbsp;... V will be the first of a cinematic trilogy which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always envisioned.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html|title=V History|website=www.kennethjohnson.us}}</ref> Johnson later updated his site to say that Desilu's option has expired,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennethjohnson.us/V-News.html|title=V News|website=www.kennethjohnson.us}}</ref> and referred to allegations that the individual helming the new Desilu was defrauding investors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/cbs-alleges-man-used-lucille-balls-old-studio-trick-investors-1156709|title=CBS Alleges Man Used Lucille Ball's Old Studio to Trick Investors|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date= October 31, 2018 |first=Eriq |last=Gardner |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\n===Original series===\n''V'' spun off a series of original novels. Five were originally planned but the range soon extended beyond these. The first was a novelization of the first two miniseries combined into one story, originally planned as 2 books, Pinnacle later changed their minds during its writing, and decreed that it should be one book (The publishers were then left with the option of another book, this became ''East Coast Crisis'')  Because the Writers guide was not ready in time for the authors to consult, most of the original novels that followed did not feature characters or continuing storylines from the TV series, but rather focused on battles against the alien invaders in other parts of the world, some were also set during the \"unrecorded year\" between the end of \"The Final Battle\" and \"Liberation day\" to get around this problem.\n\nWhile the series was on the air, new novels were published once a month by [[Pinnacle Paperbacks]], and in the U.K. every 2 months by [[New English Library]].  In 1987\u201388, the remaining 5 books, left unpublished with the demise of Pinnacle books, were published by Tor. No U.K. publisher was found for these.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Num.\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| &nbsp; Title\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Author\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Published\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| ISBN\n{{Episode list |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title        = V\n |WrittenBy    = [[Ann C.

Prior to this event, High Captain Gerald manages to finally storm the resistance, but with little success, as they were currently liberating the Chicago Art Museum, the Visitors' ground base.

It was officially ceded to Montenegro following the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] in 1913 that ended the war. After the war, Ro\u017eaje was one of the main cities that participated in the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') in 1919, which fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. An estimated 700 Albanians were killed in Ro\u017eaje when the rebellion was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}}\n\nDuring [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], the city has seen conflict between the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], the [[Chetniks]], the [[Sand\u017eak Muslim militia|Sandzak Muslim Militia]], and the Albanian [[Vulnetari]].

The novel was put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]].\n\n==Overview==\nAlthough Rousseau wrote the work as a novel, a philosophical theory about authenticity permeates through it, as he explores autonomy and authenticity as moral values. A common interpretation is that Rousseau valued the [[ethics]] of authenticity over rational moral principles, as he illustrates the principle that one should do what is imposed upon him by society only insofar as it would seem congruent with one's \"secret principles\" and feelings, being constituent of one's core identity. Thus unauthentic behavior would pave the way to self-destruction.\n\n[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] cited ''Julie, or the New Heloise'' as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite web|last = Schopenhauer|first = Arthur|title = The Art of Literature|work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | accessdate = March 22, 2015}}</ref> It is thought that the virtuous atheist Wolmar is based on [[Baron d'Holbach]], given his friendship and generous sponsorship of Rousseau.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">Michael LeBuffe, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/holbach/ \"Paul-Henri Thiry (Baron) d\u2019Holbach\"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2006 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nHistorian [[Robert Darnton]] has argued that ''Julie'' \"was perhaps the biggest best-seller of the century\".<ref>[[Robert Darnton|Darnton, Robert]]. ''The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History''. New York: Viking (1984), 242.</ref> Publishers could not print copies fast enough so they rented the book out by the day and even by the hour. According to Darnton, there were at least 70 editions in print before 1800, \"probably more than for any other novel in the previous history of publishing.\"<ref>Darnton, 242.</ref>\n\nReaders were so overcome that they wrote to Rousseau in droves, creating the first celebrity author.<ref>Darnton, 243\u201344.</ref> One reader claimed that the novel nearly drove him mad from excess of feeling while another claimed that the violent sobbing he underwent cured his cold. Reader after reader describes their \"tears\", \"sighs\", \"torments\" and \"ecstasies\" to Rousseau.<ref>Darnton, 242\u201343.</ref> One wrote in a letter to Rousseau after finishing the novel:\n<blockquote>\nI dare not tell you the effect it made on me. No, I was past weeping. A sharp pain convulsed me. My heart was crushed. Julie dying was no longer an unknown person. I believed I was her sister, her friend, her Claire. My seizure became so strong that if I had not put the book away I would have been as ill as all those who attended that virtuous woman in her last moments.<ref>Qtd. in Darnton, 243.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Heloise13.jpg|thumb|Le premier mouvement de la Nature (the first movement of Nature)]]\nSome readers simply could not accept that the book was fiction. One woman wrote to Rousseau asking:\n<blockquote>\nMany people who have read your book and discussed it with me assert that it is only a clever fabrication on your part. I can't believe that. If so, how could a mistaken reading have produced sensations like the ones I felt when I read the book? I implore you, Monsieur, tell me: did Julie really live? Is Saint-Preux still alive? What country on this earth does he inhabit? Claire, sweet Claire, did she follow her dear friend to the grave? M. de Wolmar, milord Edouard, all those persons, are they only imaginary as some want to convince me? If that be the case, what kind of a world do we inhabit, in which virtue is but an idea?<ref>Qtd. in Darnton, 245.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nOther readers identified less with the individual characters and more with their general struggles. They saw in ''Julie'' a story of temptation, sin and redemption that resembled their own lives.<ref>Darnton, 246\u201347.</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Julie'' delighted Rousseau; he took pleasure in narrating a story about how a lady ordered a horse carriage to go to an Opera, and then picked up Julie only to continue reading the book till the next morning. So many women wrote to him offering their love that he speculated there was not a single high society woman with whom he would not have succeeded if he wanted to.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=170|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Public opinion]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n* Santo L.

The novel was put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]].\n\n==Overview==\nAlthough Rousseau wrote the work as a novel, a philosophical theory about authenticity permeates through it, as he explores autonomy and authenticity as moral values. A common interpretation is that Rousseau valued the [[ethics]] of authenticity over rational moral principles, as he illustrates the principle that one should do what is imposed upon him by society only insofar as it would seem congruent with one's \"secret principles\" and feelings, being constituent of one's core identity. Thus unauthentic behavior would pave the way to self-destruction.\n\n[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] cited ''Julie, or the New Heloise'' as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'' and ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref name=\"schopenhauer_art\">{{cite web|last = Schopenhauer|first = Arthur|title = The Art of Literature|work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | accessdate = March 22, 2015}}</ref> It is thought that the virtuous atheist Wolmar is based on [[Baron d'Holbach]], given his friendship and generous sponsorship of Rousseau.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">Michael LeBuffe, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/holbach/ \"Paul-Henri Thiry (Baron) d\u2019Holbach\"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2006 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nHistorian [[Robert Darnton]] has argued that ''Julie'' \"was perhaps the biggest best-seller of the century\".<ref>[[Robert Darnton|Darnton, Robert]]. ''The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History''. New York: Viking (1984), 242.</ref> Publishers could not print copies fast enough so they rented the book out by the day and even by the hour. According to Darnton, there were at least 70 editions in print before 1800, \"probably more than for any other novel in the previous history of publishing.\"<ref>Darnton, 242.</ref>\n\nReaders were so overcome that they wrote to Rousseau in droves, creating the first celebrity author.<ref>Darnton, 243\u201344.</ref> One reader claimed that the novel nearly drove him mad from excess of feeling while another claimed that the violent sobbing he underwent cured his cold. Reader after reader describes their \"tears\", \"sighs\", \"torments\" and \"ecstasies\" to Rousseau.<ref>Darnton, 242\u201343.</ref> One wrote in a letter to Rousseau after finishing the novel:\n<blockquote>\nI dare not tell you the effect it made on me. No, I was past weeping. A sharp pain convulsed me. My heart was crushed. Julie dying was no longer an unknown person. I believed I was her sister, her friend, her Claire. My seizure became so strong that if I had not put the book away I would have been as ill as all those who attended that virtuous woman in her last moments.<ref>Qtd. in Darnton, 243.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Heloise13.jpg|thumb|Le premier mouvement de la Nature (the first movement of Nature)]]\nome readers simply could not accept that the book was fiction. One woman wrote to Rousseau asking:\n<blockquote>\nMany people who have read your book and discussed it with me assert that it is only a clever fabrication on your part. I can't believe that. If so, how could a mistaken reading have produced sensations like the ones I felt when I read the book? I implore you, Monsieur, tell me: did Julie really live? Is Saint-Preux still alive? What country on this earth does he inhabit? Claire, sweet Claire, did she follow her dear friend to the grave? M. de Wolmar, milord Edouard, all those persons, are they only imaginary as some want to convince me? If that be the case, what kind of a world do we inhabit, in which virtue is but an idea?<ref>Qtd. in Darnton, 245.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nOther readers identified less with the individual characters and more with their general struggles. They saw in ''Julie'' a story of temptation, sin and redemption that resembled their own lives.<ref>Darnton, 246\u201347.</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Julie'' delighted Rousseau; he took pleasure in narrating a story about how a lady ordered a horse carriage to go to an Opera, and then picked up Julie only to continue reading the book till the next morning. So many women wrote to him offering their love that he speculated there was not a single high society woman with whom he would not have succeeded if he wanted to.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=170|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Public opinion]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n* Santo L.
