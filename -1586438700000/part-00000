The Eighth Army took part in many of the [[amphibious landing]]s in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], eventually participating in no less than sixty of them. The first mission of the Eighth Army, in September 1944, was to take over from the [[Sixth United States Army|U.S. Sixth Army]] in [[New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Admiralty Islands]] and on [[Morotai]], in order to free up the Sixth Army to engage in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)]].\n\nThe Eighth Army again followed in the wake of the Sixth Army in December 1944, when it took over control of operations on [[Leyte Island]] on 26 December. In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on [[Luzon]], landing the [[XI Corps (United States)|XI Corps]] on 29 January near [[San Antonio, Zambales|San Antonio]] and the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]] on the other side of [[Manila Bay]] two days later. Combining with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] and [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] of Sixth Army, the forces of Eighth Army next enveloped [[Manila]] in a great double-[[pincer movement]]. Eighth Army's final operation of the [[Pacific War]] was that of clearing out the southern Philippines of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]], including on the major island of [[Mindanao]], an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war.\n\n===Occupation of Japan===\nEighth Army was to have participated in [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan. It would have taken part in [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], the second phase of the invasion, which would have seen the invasion of the [[Kant\u014d Plain]] on eastern [[Honsh\u016b]]. However, the Japanese surrender cancelled the invasion, and the Eighth Army found itself in charge of occupying it peacefully. [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation forces]] landed on 30 August 1945, with its headquarters in [[Yokohama]], then the HQ moved to the [[DN Tower 21|Dai-Ichi]] building in [[Tokyo]]. At the beginning of 1946, Eighth Army assumed responsibility for occupying all of Japan. Four quiet years then followed, during which the Eighth Army gradually deteriorated from a combat-ready fighting force into a somewhat soft, minimally-trained constabulary. Lieutenant General [[Walton H. Walker]] took command in September 1948, and he tried to re-invigorate the Army's training, but he was largely unsuccessful. This situation was to have serious consequences in South Korea.\n\n===Korean War===\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, [[Korea]] was divided into [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] with North Korea (assisted by the [[Soviet Union]]),<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/korean-war-begins This Day in History], 1950, Korean War Begins</ref> becoming a [[communism|communist]] government after 1946, known as the [[People's Republic|Democratic People's Republic]], followed by South Korea becoming the [[Republic of Korea]].<ref name=\"National Archives\">[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/korean-conflict National Archives], ''US Enters the Korean Conflict''</ref> [[China]] became the communist People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1950, the Soviet Union backed North Korea while the United States backed South Korea, and China allied with the Soviet Union in what was to become the first military action of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault], Korean War</ref>\n\n[[File:Warkorea American Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fighting with the 2nd Inf. Div. north of the Chongchon River, SFC Major Cleveland, weapons squad leader, points out Communist-led North Korean position to his machine gun crew, 20 November 1950, PFC James Cox.]]\n\nThe peace of occupied Japan was shattered in June 1950 when 75,000 [[North Korean People's Army|North Korean]] troops with [[Soviet Union|Russian]] made tanks invaded South Korea, igniting the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault] Korean War</ref> U.S. naval and air forces quickly became involved in combat operations, and it was soon clear that U.S. ground forces would have to be committed. To stem the North Korean advance, the occupation forces in Japan were thus shipped off to South Korea as quickly as possible, but their lack of training and equipment was telling, as some of the initial U.S. units were destroyed by the North Koreans. However, the stage was eventually reached as enough units of Eighth Army arrived in Korea to make a firm front. The North Koreans threw themselves against that front, the [[Pusan Perimeter]], and failed to break it. {{quote|Eighth Army arrived in July 1950 and never left. \u2014Lt. Gen. Thomas S. Vandal, CG, Eighth Army, 29 August 2017<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/193076/the_national_defense_committee_visits_eighth_army_hqs The National Defense Committee visits Eighth Army Headquarters (29 August 2017)]</ref>}} In the meantime, Eighth Army had reorganized, since it had too many divisions under its command for it to exercise effective control directly. The [[U.S. I Corps|I Corps]] and the [[U.S. IX Corps|IX Corps]] were reactivated in the United States and then shipped to Korea to assume command of Eighth Army's subordinate divisions.\n\nThe stalemate was broken by the [[Battle of Incheon|Inchon landings]] of the [[U.S. X Corps|X Corps]] (tenth corps, consisting of soldiers and Marines). The North Korean forces, when confronted with this threat to their rear areas, combined with a breakout operation at Pusan, broke away and hastily retired north.\n\n[[File:General Walker and Lt. Gen William Dean.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lt. Gen. Walker (left) confers with Maj. Gen. [[William F. Dean]], Commander Ground Forces in Korea, on 7 July 1950]]\nBoth South and North Korea were almost entirely occupied by United Nations forces. However, once U.S. units neared the [[Yalu River]] and the frontier between North Korea and [[China]], the Chinese intervened and drastically changed the character of the war. Eighth Army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of the Chongchon River]] and forced to retreat all the way back to South Korea. U.S. historian [[Clay Blair]] noted that the Eighth Army was left completely unprotected on its right flank due to the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s retreat despite myths that arose about the Turks killing 200 enemies by bayonet. The defeat of the U.S. Eighth Army resulted in the longest retreat of any U.S. military unit in history. General Walker was killed in a jeep accident on 23 December 1950, and replaced by Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]]. The overstretched Eighth Army suffered heavily with the Chinese offensive, who were able to benefit from shorter lines of communication and with rather casually deployed enemy forces. The Chinese broke through the U.S. defenses despite U.S. [[air supremacy]] and the Eighth Army and U.N. forces retreated hastily to avoid encirclement. The Chinese offensive continued pressing U.S. forces, which lost [[Seoul]], the South Korean capital. Eighth Army's morale and ''esprit de corps'' hit rock bottom, to where it was widely regarded as a broken, defeated rabble.\n\nGeneral Ridgway forcefully restored Eighth Army to combat effectiveness over several months. Eighth Army slowed and ultimately halted the Chinese advance at the battles of [[Chipyong-ni]] and [[Wonju]]. It then counter-attacked the Chinese, re-took Seoul, and drove to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], where the front stabilized.\n\nWhen General Ridgway replaced [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] as the overall U.N. commander, Lieutenant General [[James Van Fleet]] assumed command of Eighth Army. After the war of movement during the first stages, the fighting in Korea settled down to a war of attrition. Ceasefire negotiations were begun at the village of [[Panmunjom]] in the summer of 1951, and they dragged on for two years. During the final combat operation of the war, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] (promoted to general 23 June 1953) commanded the Eighth Army. When the [[Military Demarcation Line]] was finally agreed to by the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Agreement]], South Korea and North Korea continued on as separate states.\n\n===Occupation of Korea===\n[[File:Eighth United States Army memorial (South Korea) 001.jpg|thumb|Eighth United States Army memorial at Yongsan]]\nDuring the [[aftermath of the Korean War]], the Eighth Army remained in South Korea. By the 1960s, I Corps, consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], remained as part of the Eighth Army. Then, in 1971, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, along with the command units of I Corps, which were moved across the Pacific Ocean to [[Fort Lewis]], [[State of Washington|Washington]].<ref>Don Oberdorfter, ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'', Addison-Wesley, 1997, p. 86.</ref> Later, in March 1977, a memo from President Jimmy Carter said \"...American forces will be withdrawn. Air cover will be continued.\" Bureaucratic resistance from the Executive Branch, with support in Congress, eventually saw the proposal watered down. Eventually one combat battalion and about 2,600 non-combat troops were withdrawn.<ref>Oberdorfer, The Two Koreas, 1997, 86-94.</ref>\n\nThis left the 2nd Infantry Division at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] to assist the [[South Korean Army]]. Besides forming a trip-wire against another North Korean invasion, the 2nd Infantry Division remained there as the only Army unit in South Korea armed with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. (Otherwise, there is only the [[U.S. Air Force]] in South Korea and on [[Okinawa]].)  All nuclear weapons were taken from the Army to be under Air Force control. Later, all U.S. nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea.\n\nIn 2003, plans were announced to move the 2nd Infantry Division southward. As of 2015, it appears that one brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division will remain at [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]], near [[Dongducheon]].\n\nThe headquarters of the Eighth Army is [[Yongsan Garrison]], but it is scheduled to move southward to [[Camp Humphreys]] by 2019.<ref name=MoveGarrison/> In April 2017 the Eighth Army headquarters began its move from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys and held a ceremony to relocate a statue of General Walton Walker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/04/26/2017042601582.html|publisher=The Chosun Ilbo|title=8th U.S. Army Starts Moving Out of Seoul|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current structure==\n[[File:Eighth US Army -

The Eighth Army took part in many of the [[amphibious landing]]s in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], eventually participating in no less than sixty of them. The first mission of the Eighth Army, in September 1944, was to take over from the [[Sixth United States Army|U.S. Sixth Army]] in [[New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Admiralty Islands]] and on [[Morotai]], in order to free up the Sixth Army to engage in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)]].\n\nThe Eighth Army again followed in the wake of the Sixth Army in December 1944, when it took over control of operations on [[Leyte Island]] on 26 December. In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on [[Luzon]], landing the [[XI Corps (United States)|XI Corps]] on 29 January near [[San Antonio, Zambales|San Antonio]] and the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]] on the other side of [[Manila Bay]] two days later. Combining with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] and [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] of Sixth Army, the forces of Eighth Army next enveloped [[Manila]] in a great double-[[pincer movement]]. Eighth Army's final operation of the [[Pacific War]] was that of clearing out the southern Philippines of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]], including on the major island of [[Mindanao]], an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war.\n\n===Occupation of Japan===\nEighth Army was to have participated in [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan. It would have taken part in [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], the second phase of the invasion, which would have seen the invasion of the [[Kant\u014d Plain]] on eastern [[Honsh\u016b]]. However, the Japanese surrender cancelled the invasion, and the Eighth Army found itself in charge of occupying it peacefully. [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation forces]] landed on 30 August 1945, with its headquarters in [[Yokohama]], then the HQ moved to the [[DN Tower 21|Dai-Ichi]] building in [[Tokyo]]. At the beginning of 1946, Eighth Army assumed responsibility for occupying all of Japan. Four quiet years then followed, during which the Eighth Army gradually deteriorated from a combat-ready fighting force into a somewhat soft, minimally-trained constabulary. Lieutenant General [[Walton H. Walker]] took command in September 1948, and he tried to re-invigorate the Army's training, but he was largely unsuccessful. This situation was to have serious consequences in South Korea.\n\n===Korean War===\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, [[Korea]] was divided into [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] with North Korea (assisted by the [[Soviet Union]]),<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/korean-war-begins This Day in History], 1950, Korean War Begins</ref> becoming a [[communism|communist]] government after 1946, known as the [[People's Republic|Democratic People's Republic]], followed by South Korea becoming the [[Republic of Korea]].<ref name=\"National Archives\">[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/korean-conflict National Archives], ''US Enters the Korean Conflict''</ref> [[China]] became the communist People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1950, the Soviet Union backed North Korea while the United States backed South Korea, and China allied with the Soviet Union in what was to become the first military action of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault], Korean War</ref>\n\n[[File:Warkorea American Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fighting with the 2nd Inf. Div. north of the Chongchon River, SFC Major Cleveland, weapons squad leader, points out Communist-led North Korean position to his machine gun crew, 20 November 1950, PFC James Cox.]]\n\nThe peace of occupied Japan was shattered in June 1950 when 75,000 [[North Korean People's Army|North Korean]] troops with [[Soviet Union|Russian]] made tanks invaded South Korea, igniting the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault] Korean War</ref> U.S. naval and air forces quickly became involved in combat operations, and it was soon clear that U.S. ground forces would have to be committed. To stem the North Korean advance, the occupation forces in Japan were thus shipped off to South Korea as quickly as possible, but their lack of training and equipment was telling, as some of the initial U.S. units were destroyed by the North Koreans. However, the stage was eventually reached as enough units of Eighth Army arrived in Korea to make a firm front. The North Koreans threw themselves against that front, the [[Pusan Perimeter]], and failed to break it. {{quote|Eighth Army arrived in July 1950 and never left. \u2014Lt. Gen. Thomas S. Vandal, CG, Eighth Army, 29 August 2017<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/193076/the_national_defense_committee_visits_eighth_army_hqs The National Defense Committee visits Eighth Army Headquarters (29 August 2017)]</ref>}} In the meantime, Eighth Army had reorganized, since it had too many divisions under its command for it to exercise effective control directly. The [[U.S. I Corps|I Corps]] and the [[U.S. IX Corps|IX Corps]] were reactivated in the United States and then shipped to Korea to assume command of Eighth Army's subordinate divisions.\n\nThe stalemate was broken by the [[Battle of Incheon|Inchon landings]] of the [[U.S. X Corps|X Corps]] (tenth corps, consisting of soldiers and Marines). The North Korean forces, when confronted with this threat to their rear areas, combined with a breakout operation at Pusan, broke away and hastily retired north.\n\n[[File:General Walker and Lt. Gen William Dean.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lt. Gen. Walker (left) confers with Maj. Gen. [[William F. Dean]], Commander Ground Forces in Korea, on 7 July 1950]]\nBoth South and North Korea were almost entirely occupied by United Nations forces. However, once U.S. units neared the [[Yalu River]] and the frontier between North Korea and [[China]], the Chinese intervened and drastically changed the character of the war. Eighth Army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of the Chongchon River]] and forced to retreat all the way back to South Korea. U.S. historian [[Clay Blair]] noted that the Eighth Army was left completely unprotected on its right flank due to the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s retreat despite myths that arose about the Turks killing 200 enemies by bayonet. The defeat of the U.S. Eighth Army resulted in the longest retreat of any U.S. military unit in history. General Walker was killed in a jeep accident on 23 December 1950, and replaced by Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]]. The overstretched Eighth Army suffered heavily with the Chinese offensive, who were able to benefit from shorter lines of communication and with rather casually deployed enemy forces. The Chinese broke through the U.S. defenses despite U.S. [[air supremacy]] and the Eighth Army and U.N. forces retreated hastily to avoid encirclement. The Chinese offensive continued pressing U.S. forces, which lost [[Seoul]], the South Korean capital. Eighth Army's morale and ''esprit de corps'' hit rock bottom, to where it was widely regarded as a broken, defeated rabble.\n\nGeneral Ridgway forcefully restored Eighth Army to combat effectiveness over several months. Eighth Army slowed and ultimately halted the Chinese advance at the battles of [[Chipyong-ni]] and [[Wonju]]. It then counter-attacked the Chinese, re-took Seoul, and drove to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], where the front stabilized.\n\nWhen General Ridgway replaced [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] as the overall U.N. commander, Lieutenant General [[James Van Fleet]] assumed command of Eighth Army. After the war of movement during the first stages, the fighting in Korea settled down to a war of attrition. Ceasefire negotiations were begun at the village of [[Panmunjom]] in the summer of 1951, and they dragged on for two years. During the final combat operation of the war, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] (promoted to general 23 June 1953) commanded the Eighth Army. When the [[Military Demarcation Line]] was finally agreed to by the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Agreement]], South Korea and North Korea continued on as separate states.\n\n===Occupation of Korea===\n[[File:Eighth United States Army memorial (South Korea) 001.jpg|thumb|Eighth United States Army memorial at Yongsan]]\nDuring the [[aftermath of the Korean War]], the Eighth Army remained in South Korea. By the 1960s, I Corps, consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], remained as part of the Eighth Army. Then, in 1971, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, along with the command units of I Corps, which were moved across the Pacific Ocean to [[Fort Lewis]], [[State of Washington|Washington]].<ref>Don Oberdorfter, ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'', Addison-Wesley, 1997, p. 86.</ref> Later, in March 1977, a memo from President Jimmy Carter said \"...American forces will be withdrawn. Air cover will be continued.\" Bureaucratic resistance from the Executive Branch, with support in Congress, eventually saw the proposal watered down. Eventually one combat battalion and about 2,600 non-combat troops were withdrawn.<ref>Oberdorfer, The Two Koreas, 1997, 86-94.</ref>\n\nThis left the 2nd Infantry Division at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] to assist the [[South Korean Army]]. Besides forming a trip-wire against another North Korean invasion, the 2nd Infantry Division remained there as the only Army unit in South Korea armed with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. (Otherwise, there is only the [[U.S. Air Force]] in South Korea and on [[Okinawa]].)  All nuclear weapons were taken from the Army to be under Air Force control. Later, all U.S. nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea.\n\nIn 2003, plans were announced to move the 2nd Infantry Division southward. As of 2015, it appears that one brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division will remain at [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]], near [[Dongducheon]].\n\nThe headquarters of the Eighth Army is [[Yongsan Garrison]], but it is scheduled to move southward to [[Camp Humphreys]] by 2019.<ref name=MoveGarrison/> In April 2017 the Eighth Army headquarters began its move from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys and held a ceremony to relocate a statue of General Walton Walker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/04/26/2017042601582.html|publisher=The Chosun Ilbo|title=8th U.S. Army Starts Moving Out of Seoul|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current structure==\n[[File:Eighth US Army -

in Europe, and in summer 1998 in the United States (as ''TOCA Championship Racing''). Featuring all the licensed cars (not including privateers) and tracks from the 1997 British Touring Car Championship, the game was critically acclaimed by the European games press\u2014especially on console where it was widely considered the best in its genre until the release of ''Gran Turismo'' several months later.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===''TOCA 2 Touring Cars'' (1998)===\n{{Main|TOCA 2 Touring Cars}}\nThe success of the first ''TOCA'' game saw a sequel arrive a year later in 1998. Whilst mainly an annual franchise update of cars and tracks, the game did add more detailed graphics, physics, multiplayer modes and other minor features. Fictional (but realistic) tracks were added, and support races such as Ford Fiestas, Formula Ford and others also arrived. The level of car damage possible during a race was also enhanced, which was a significant selling point compared with the likes of ''Gran Turismo''. It was called ''Touring Car Challenge'' in the USA.\n\n===''TOCA World Touring Cars'' (2000)===\n{{Main|TOCA World Touring Cars}}\nAs the title suggests, the series made a significant advance in featuring various Touring Car championships from around the world, ''TOCA World Touring Cars'', which was released in 2000, but despite carrying the TOCA name, a fully licensed British Touring Car Championship (TOCA) series was not included. This upset a lot of fans of the series, but it was not that bad, and success continued. The gameplay overall became more \"arcadey\" and the replacement of qualifying laps with random grid positions together with the omission of penalties for bad driving made the game much more playable for the casual gamer. Curiously, unlike the first two titles in the ''TOCA'' series, ''World Touring Cars'' was not released in a Windows version.\n\n===''TOCA Race Driver'' (2002)===\n{{Main|TOCA Race Driver}}\nThe series moved onto the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|6th generation of gaming]] in August 2002, with the release of ''TOCA Race Driver'' (called ''DTM Race Driver'' in Germany, ''Pro Race Driver'' in North America and ''V8 Supercars: Race Driver'' in Australia). The game took a new direction, reincluding the BTCC series that the previous game had been missing but most importantly, a plot (leading to the game being labelled as a \"Car-PG\") where the user took on the role of a fictional race driver called Ryan McKane, trying to make a name for himself in a multitude of car championships, all the while under the shadow of his more successful older brother and haunted by the death of his father on the racetrack (as witnessed by Ryan as a child).\n\n===''TOCA Race Driver 2'' (2004)===\n{{Main|TOCA Race Driver 2}}\n''Race Driver 2'' was released on Xbox and PC in April 2004, with a PlayStation 2 version following six months later.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Two PSP conversions were released in 2005 and 2006, the first being ''[[TOCA Race Driver 2]]'' in Europe and Japan and the second being ''Race Driver 2006'' in the US. The game continued to use a scripted career mode as introduced in the previous ''Race Driver'' game but dropped the Ryan McKane character.\n\n===''TOCA Race Driver 3'' (2006)===\n{{Main|TOCA Race Driver 3}}\nThe third game in the ''TOCA Race Driver'' series was released in February 2006, and continued to expand on the types of motorsport available. [[Open wheel car|Open wheel]], [[Grand tourer|GT]], [[Oval racing]], [[Rallying]] and [[Offroad racing]] were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World Tour. Up to 12 players are supported via Xbox Live and the PlayStation 2 version supports up to 8 online. This series is the only racing simulator that allows PlayStation players to race online before ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]''. It received good reviews, frequently being compared favourably to ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport]]'', in the aspects of cars on track, damage and AI.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===''Race Driver 2006'' (2006)===\n{{Main|Race Driver 2006}}\nIt is an expanded edition of ''[[TOCA Race Driver 2]]'' released exclusively for [[PlayStation Portable]].\n\n===''Race Driver: Create & Race'' (2007)===\n{{Main|Race Driver: Create & Race}}\nIt was the first game in the ''TOCA'' series to be available for [[Nintendo DS]] and was released in September 2007. It includes many licensed vehicles and tracks from across the world. It has also the ability to allow players to create their own circuit either using the [[stylus]] (albeit rather simply) or by using the custom-made pieces made by the game developers. Then you can also exchange tracks online using a [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. It also has career, multiplayer and single-race modes.\n\n===''Race Driver: Grid'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Race Driver: Grid}}\nPreviously going under the working title \"Race Driver One\", ''Race Driver: Grid'' is the full and official title of the sequel to ''TOCA Race Driver 3''. The game was released for [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Games for Windows]] on 3 June 2008, after over one million people downloaded the demo. It featured an improved [[graphics engine]] (a common complaint was that even on the lowest setting the graphics couldn't be handled by low-spec PCs) from ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt]]'', has over 40 real-life cars and a variety of both fictional and realistic interpretations of tracks.\n\n===''Grid 2'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Grid 2}}\nOn 8 August 2012, Codemasters announced that the sequel to ''Race Driver: GRID'', ''Grid 2'' was in development. Codemasters stated that ''Grid 2'' \"will challenge players to be fast, be first and be famous as they enter a stunning new world of competitive motorsport\", the game was released on 28 May 2013 on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codemasters.com/uk/article/the-race-returns-in-2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810234626/http://www.codemasters.com/uk/article/the-race-returns-in-2013 |archivedate=10 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===''Grid Autosport'' (2014)===\n{{Main|Grid Autosport}}\nThe ninth game aims to move the series back towards \"more authentic racing games\" following the release of Grid 2, which Codemasters felt was not as well-received by the company's core fanbase as it was hoped for. The developers consequently introduced major modifications to the handling model and built a lean, race-first oriented design for this title. It's available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]] with announced releases for iOS, Android, and [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Grid'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Grid (2019 video game)}}\nA fourth instalment in the ''Grid'' sub-series, simply known as ''[[Grid (2019 video game)|Grid]]'', was released on 11 October 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] and on 19 November 2019 for [[Google Stadia|Stadia]]. It featured vehicles from the GT Le Mans; the game was developed under [[Fernando Alonso]]'s consultation and employs a new AI system, called \"Nemesis\": opponents can be driven by up to 400 AI profiles, simulating different driving styles and behaviours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-21-codemasters-reveals-an-all-new-grid|title=Codemasters reveals an all-new Grid|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=21 May 2019|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/grid/grid-gameplay-codemasters|title=The Nemesis system in Codemasters\u2019 GRID reboot makes for dramatic racing|website=PCGamesN|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=-group/toca-racing-games}}\n\n{{TOCA series}}\n{{Codemasters}}\n\n[[Category:Codemasters franchises]]\n[[Category:Racing video games]]\n[[Category:TOCA| ]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1997]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the video game series|the organisers of the British Touring Car Championship|TOCA}}\n{{italic title|string=TOCA}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}\n{{Infobox VG series\n| title                  = TOCA\n| image                  = \n| caption                = \n| genre                  = [[Racing video game|Racing]]\n| developer              = [[Codemasters]]\n| publisher              = [[Codemasters]]\n| platforms              = [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Mobile game|Mobile]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[iOS]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Arcade game|Arcade]], [[Linux]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]]\n| first release version  = ''[[TOCA Touring Car Championship]]''\n| first release date     = November 1997\n| latest release version = ''[[Grid (2019 video game)|GRID]]''\n| latest release date    = 11 October 2019\n}}\n\n'''''TOCA''''' is a [[racing video game]] series developed and published by [[Codemasters]].

in Europe, and in summer 1998 in the United States (as ''TOCA Championship Racing''). Featuring all the licensed cars (not including privateers) and tracks from the 1997 British Touring Car Championship, the game was critically acclaimed by the European games press\u2014especially on console where it was widely considered the best in its genre until the release of ''Gran Turismo'' several months later.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===''TOCA 2 Touring Cars'' (1998)===\n{{Main|TOCA 2 Touring Cars}}\nThe success of the first ''TOCA'' game saw a sequel arrive a year later in 1998. Whilst mainly an annual franchise update of cars and tracks, the game did add more detailed graphics, physics, multiplayer modes and other minor features. Fictional (but realistic) tracks were added, and support races such as Ford Fiestas, Formula Ford and others also arrived. The level of car damage possible during a race was also enhanced, which was a significant selling point compared with the likes of ''Gran Turismo''. It was called ''Touring Car Challenge'' in the USA.\n\n===''TOCA World Touring Cars'' (2000)===\n{{Main|TOCA World Touring Cars}}\nAs the title suggests, the series made a significant advance in featuring various Touring Car championships from around the world, ''TOCA World Touring Cars'', which was released in 2000, but despite carrying the TOCA name, a fully licensed British Touring Car Championship (TOCA) series was not included. This upset a lot of fans of the series, but it was not that bad, and success continued. The gameplay overall became more \"arcadey\" and the replacement of qualifying laps with random grid positions together with the omission of penalties for bad driving made the game much more playable for the casual gamer. Curiously, unlike the first two titles in the ''TOCA'' series, ''World Touring Cars'' was not released in a Windows version.\n\n===''TOCA Race Driver'' (2002)===\n{{Main|TOCA Race Driver}}\nThe series moved onto the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|6th generation of gaming]] in August 2002, with the release of ''TOCA Race Driver'' (called ''DTM Race Driver'' in Germany, ''Pro Race Driver'' in North America and ''V8 Supercars: Race Driver'' in Australia). The game took a new direction, reincluding the BTCC series that the previous game had been missing but most importantly, a plot (leading to the game being labelled as a \"Car-PG\") where the user took on the role of a fictional race driver called Ryan McKane, trying to make a name for himself in a multitude of car championships, all the while under the shadow of his more successful older brother and haunted by the death of his father on the racetrack (as witnessed by Ryan as a child).\n\n===''TOCA Race Driver 2'' (2004)===\n{{Main|TOCA Race Driver 2}}\n''Race Driver 2'' was released on Xbox and PC in April 2004, with a PlayStation 2 version following six months later.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Two PSP conversions were released in 2005 and 2006, the first being ''[[TOCA Race Driver 2]]'' in Europe and Japan and the second being ''Race Driver 2006'' in the US. The game continued to use a scripted career mode as introduced in the previous ''Race Driver'' game but dropped the Ryan McKane character.\n\n===''TOCA Race Driver 3'' (2006)===\n{{Main|TOCA Race Driver 3}}\nThe third game in the ''TOCA Race Driver'' series was released in February 2006, and continued to expand on the types of motorsport available. [[Open wheel car|Open wheel]], [[Grand tourer|GT]], [[Oval racing]], [[Rallying]] and [[Offroad racing]] were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World Tour. Up to 12 players are supported via Xbox Live and the PlayStation 2 version supports up to 8 online. This series is the only racing simulator that allows PlayStation players to race online before ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]''. It received good reviews, frequently being compared favourably to ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport]]'', in the aspects of cars on track, damage and AI.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===''Race Driver 2006'' (2006)===\n{{Main|Race Driver 2006}}\nIt is an expanded edition of ''[[TOCA Race Driver 2]]'' released exclusively for [[PlayStation Portable]].\n\n===''Race Driver: Create & Race'' (2007)===\n{{Main|Race Driver: Create & Race}}\nIt was the first game in the ''TOCA'' series to be available for [[Nintendo DS]] and was released in September 2007. It includes many licensed vehicles and tracks from across the world. It has also the ability to allow players to create their own circuit either using the [[stylus]] (albeit rather simply) or by using the custom-made pieces made by the game developers. Then you can also exchange tracks online using a [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. It also has career, multiplayer and single-race modes.\n\n===''Race Driver: Grid'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Race Driver: Grid}}\nPreviously going under the working title \"Race Driver One\", ''Race Driver: Grid'' is the full and official title of the sequel to ''TOCA Race Driver 3''. The game was released for [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Games for Windows]] on 3 June 2008, after over one million people downloaded the demo. It featured an improved [[graphics engine]] (a common complaint was that even on the lowest setting the graphics couldn't be handled by low-spec PCs) from ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt]]'', has over 40 real-life cars and a variety of both fictional and realistic interpretations of tracks.\n\n===''Grid 2'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Grid 2}}\nOn 8 August 2012, Codemasters announced that the sequel to ''Race Driver: GRID'', ''Grid 2'' was in development. Codemasters stated that ''Grid 2'' \"will challenge players to be fast, be first and be famous as they enter a stunning new world of competitive motorsport\", the game was released on 28 May 2013 on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codemasters.com/uk/article/the-race-returns-in-2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810234626/http://www.codemasters.com/uk/article/the-race-returns-in-2013 |archivedate=10 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===''Grid Autosport'' (2014)===\n{{Main|Grid Autosport}}\nThe ninth game aims to move the series back towards \"more authentic racing games\" following the release of Grid 2, which Codemasters felt was not as well-received by the company's core fanbase as it was hoped for. The developers consequently introduced major modifications to the handling model and built a lean, race-first oriented design for this title. It's available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Linux]] and [[macOS]] with announced releases for iOS, Android, and [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Grid'' (2019)===\n{{Main|Grid (2019 video game)}}\nA fourth instalment in the ''Grid'' sub-series, simply known as ''[[Grid (2019 video game)|Grid]]'', was released on 11 October 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]], and [[Xbox One]]. It featured vehicles from the GT Le Mans; the game was developed under [[Fernando Alonso]]'s consultation and employs a new AI system, called \"Nemesis\": opponents can be driven by up to 400 AI profiles, simulating different driving styles and behaviours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-21-codemasters-reveals-an-all-new-grid|title=Codemasters reveals an all-new Grid|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=21 May 2019|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/grid/grid-gameplay-codemasters|title=The Nemesis system in Codemasters\u2019 GRID reboot makes for dramatic racing|website=PCGamesN|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-26}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=-group/toca-racing-games}}\n\n{{TOCA series}}\n{{Codemasters}}\n\n[[Category:Codemasters franchises]]\n[[Category:Racing video games]]\n[[Category:TOCA| ]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1997]]\n", "name_user": "Atul Kedia", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGrid (2019)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOCA_(series)"}

Though a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] for most of his political service, he joined the [[Know Nothing Party|Know Nothing]], or American, Party in 1855, and was the only governor of Kentucky ever elected from that party.\n\nMorehead's political service began in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] in 1828. In 1832, he was appointed [[Attorney General of Kentucky|state attorney general]]. He served in this capacity for five years, and later returned to the Kentucky House, where he was chosen [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] three times. He was elected to Congress in 1848 and served two terms. After his congressional tenure, he joined the Know Nothing Party and was chosen as the party's candidate for governor in 1855. The campaign was marred by anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic rhetoric that touched off the \"[[Bloody Monday]]\" riots in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].\n\nMorehead was a delegate to the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] and the [[Border States Convention]] that attempted to stave off the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He was released from prison in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and [[Mexico]]. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in [[Greenville, Mississippi]], where he died on December 21, 1868.\n\n==Early life==\nCharles Slaughter Morehead was born near [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Nelson County, Kentucky]] on July 7, 1802.<ref name=congbio>\"Charles S. Morehead\"</ref> He was the son of Charles and Margaret (Slaughter) Morehead and a first cousin to Kentucky's twelfth governor, James Turner Morehead.<ref name=powell50>Powell, p. 50</ref> His father served in [[bicameral legislature|both houses]] of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]].<ref name=powell50/>\n\nMorehead was educated in the area's public schools, then matriculated to Transylvania University.<ref name=congbio/> He earned a bachelor's degree in 1820, graduating with honors.<ref name=perrin89>Perrin, p. 89</ref><ref name=nga>Kentucky Governor Charles Slaughter Morehead</ref> After graduation, he became a tutor at the university and earned a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1822.<ref name=powell50/> He relocated to [[Christian County, Kentucky]], was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]], and commenced practice in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]].<ref name=congbio/><ref name=perrin89/> He also worked as a farmer, and owned [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s in [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].<ref name=congbio/>\n\nMorehead married Amanda Leavy on July 10, 1823.<ref name=harrison648>Harrison, p. 648</ref> She died July 5, 1829 at the age of twenty-five.<ref name=powell50/> Following her death, Morehead married Margaret Leavy, his first wife's sister, on September 6, 1831.<ref name=harrison648/> Together they had four children.<ref name=harrison648/> Charles and Margaret were very fond of music, theater, dances, and parties.<ref name=\"ramage75\">Ramage, p. 75.</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nMorehead was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1828 and was re-elected in 1829.<ref name=congbio/><ref name=harrison648/> Following his second term in the legislature, he moved to [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], believing it provided better opportunities for his legal practice.<ref>Perrin, pp. 89&ndash;90</ref> He was appointed as state attorney general in 1832 and served for five years.<ref name=perrin90>Perrin, p. 90</ref> In 1834, he co-authored ''A Digest of the Statute Laws of Kentucky'' with [[Mason Brown]].<ref name=harrison648/> He represented Franklin County in the state house from 1838 to 1842 and again in 1844; he was chosen Speaker of the House in 1840, 1841, and 1844.<ref name=levin119>Levin, p. 119</ref>\n\nMorehead was elected the [[Thirtieth Congress|Thirtieth]] and [[Thirty-first Congress|Thirty-first]] Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851.<ref name=congbio/> During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus considered him as a candidate for Speaker of the House.<ref name=holt471>Holt, p. 471</ref> The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849.<ref name=holt470>Holt, p. 470</ref> The caucus first chose [[Robert C. Winthrop]] as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus.<ref name=holt470>Holt, p. 470</ref> Some Whigs from northern states voted for [[David Wilmot]], a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]], while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for [[Meredith Poindexter Gentry|Meredith Gentry]].<ref name=holt470/> The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] were similarly unable to muster a majority for their candidate, [[Howell Cobb]].<ref name=holt470/>\n\nAt their caucus meeting on the night of December 10, the Whigs agreed to continue voting for Winthrop for one more day, and if he was not elected, to switch their support to Morehead, who they believed could hold all of Winthrop's votes and win the votes of the southern Whigs as well as some southern Democrats. They made their intentions known on December 11, and by the end of the day, Morehead reported that he had received commitments of support from twenty southern Democrats. During the day's voting, the five southern Whigs shifted their support from Gentry to Morehead. This shift cost Morehead the support of many northern Whigs who, at the caucus meeting the night of December 11, declared that Morehead's election \"would ruin the Whig party in the North\",<ref name=holt471>Holt, p. 471</ref> especially if he gained the support of southern Democrats. Rather than further fracture the caucus, Morehead withdrew his name from consideration. Cobb was finally elected on the sixty-third ballot on December 22.<ref name=holt472>Holt, pp. 471&ndash;472</ref>\n\n===Governor of Kentucky===\nFollowing his congressional tenure, Morehead resumed his law practice and management of his plantations.<ref name=congbio/> In 1852, he was a [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] for [[Winfield Scott]], and in 1853, he served another term in the Kentucky House.<ref name=powell50/> By early 1855, sectional divisions had ripped apart the national Whig Party.<ref name=holt936>Holt, p.936</ref> In Kentucky, many former Whigs associated with the Know Nothing Party.<ref name=holt936/> Morehead was among these; he claimed that the Know Nothing Party was more \"Union\" than the Democratic Party.<ref name=ramage75/> The ex-Whigs hoped to take over the Know Nothing Party and reshape it into a Unionist Whig organization.<ref name=holt936/> Accordingly, when the Know Nothing candidate for governor, Judge William Loving, withdrew from the race due to failing health, the influx of ex-Whigs nominated Morehead to replace him for the gubernatorial election of 1855.<ref name=holt936/> Prior to the dissolution of the party, most had expected the Whigs would nominate Morehead at their own party's convention in April.<ref name=holt936/>\n\nThough Kentucky had only a small population of immigrants and Catholics, much of Morehead's campaign oratory was directed against these groups.<ref name=ramage75/> Most of the state's immigrant and Catholic population resided in Louisville, and tensions there reached a climax with an anti-foreign riot known as \"Bloody Monday\" on August 6, 1855.<ref name=powell50/> Morehead won the election with 69,816 votes to 65,413 votes for Democrat [[Beverly L. Clarke]].<ref name=harrison648/> In his inaugural address, Morehead denounced the [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]] of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] and despite his campaign rhetoric, proclaimed \"perfect equality\" for naturalized citizens.<ref name=ramage76>Ramage, p. 76</ref>\n\nMorehead's term as governor was an active one. He approved the appropriation of funding for the first Kentucky State Fair, which was seen as a vehicle for encouraging improvements in agriculture.<ref name=harrison648/> He also approved the formation of the Kentucky State Agricultural Society in 1856.<ref name=harrison648/> The state geological survey begun under Governor [[Lazarus W. Powell]] was completed and published.<ref name=harrison648/> [[Internal improvements]] progressed as well; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead's term.<ref name=ramage76/>\n\nKentucky's school system was expanding rapidly, creating a shortage of qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University made the transition from a private institution to a state-supported university. Money raised through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.<ref name=ramage76/>\n\nThe number of prisoners housed in the state penitentiary at Frankfort was also increasing. By 1856, 237 prisoners were detained in the facility which  had only 126 cells.

Though a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] for most of his political service, he joined the [[Know Nothing Party|Know Nothing]], or American, Party in 1855, and was the only governor of Kentucky ever elected from that party.\n\nMorehead's political service began in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] in 1828. In 1832, he was appointed [[Attorney General of Kentucky|state attorney general]]. He served in this capacity for five years, and later returned to the Kentucky House, where he was chosen [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] three times. He was elected to Congress in 1848 and served two terms. After his congressional tenure, he joined the Know Nothing Party and was chosen as the party's candidate for governor in 1855. The campaign was marred by anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic rhetoric that touched off the \"[[Bloody Monday]]\" riots in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].\n\nMorehead was a delegate to the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] and the [[Border States Convention]] that attempted to stave off the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He was released from prison in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and [[Mexico]]. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in [[Greenville, Mississippi]], where he died on December 21, 1868.\n\n==Early life==\nCharles Slaughter Morehead was born near [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Nelson County, Kentucky]] on July 7, 1802.<ref name=congbio>\"Charles S. Morehead\"</ref> He was the son of Charles and Margaret (Slaughter) Morehead and a first cousin to Kentucky's twelfth governor, James Turner Morehead.<ref name=powell50>Powell, p. 50</ref> His father served in [[bicameral legislature|both houses]] of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]].<ref name=powell50/>\n\nMorehead was educated in the area's public schools, then matriculated to Transylvania University.<ref name=congbio/> He earned a bachelor's degree in 1820, graduating with honors.<ref name=perrin89>Perrin, p. 89</ref><ref name=nga>Kentucky Governor Charles Slaughter Morehead</ref> After graduation, he became a tutor at the university and earned a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1822.<ref name=powell50/> He relocated to [[Christian County, Kentucky]], was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]], and commenced practice in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]].<ref name=congbio/><ref name=perrin89/> He also worked as a farmer, and owned [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s in [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]].<ref name=congbio/>\n\nMorehead married Amanda Leavy on July 10, 1823.<ref name=harrison648>Harrison, p. 648</ref> She died July 5, 1829 at the age of twenty-five.<ref name=powell50/> Following her death, Morehead married Margaret Leavy, his first wife's sister, on September 6, 1831.<ref name=harrison648/> Together they had four children.<ref name=harrison648/> Charles and Margaret were very fond of music, theater, dances, and parties.<ref name=\"ramage75\">Ramage, p. 75.</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nMorehead was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1828 and was re-elected in 1829.<ref name=congbio/><ref name=harrison648/> Following his second term in the legislature, he moved to [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], believing it provided better opportunities for his legal practice.<ref>Perrin, pp. 89&ndash;90</ref> He was appointed as state attorney general in 1832 and served for five years.<ref name=perrin90>Perrin, p. 90</ref> In 1834, he co-authored ''A Digest of the Statute Laws of Kentucky'' with [[Mason Brown]].<ref name=harrison648/> He represented Franklin County in the state house from 1838 to 1842 and again in 1844; he was chosen Speaker of the House in 1840, 1841, and 1844.<ref name=levin119>Levin, p. 119</ref>\n\nMorehead was elected the [[Thirtieth Congress|Thirtieth]] and [[Thirty-first Congress|Thirty-first]] Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851.<ref name=congbio/> During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus considered him as a candidate for Speaker of the House.<ref name=holt471>Holt, p. 471</ref> The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849.<ref name=holt470>Holt, p. 470</ref> The caucus first chose [[Robert C. Winthrop]] as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus.<ref name=holt470>Holt, p. 470</ref> Some Whigs from northern states voted for [[David Wilmot]], a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]], while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for [[Meredith Poindexter Gentry|Meredith Gentry]].<ref name=holt470/> The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] were similarly unable to muster a majority for their candidate, [[Howell Cobb]].<ref name=holt470/>\n\nAt their caucus meeting on the night of December 10, the Whigs agreed to continue voting for Winthrop for one more day, and if he was not elected, to switch their support to Morehead, who they believed could hold all of Winthrop's votes and win the votes of the southern Whigs as well as some southern Democrats. They made their intentions known on December 11, and by the end of the day, Morehead reported that he had received commitments of support from twenty southern Democrats. During the day's voting, the five southern Whigs shifted their support from Gentry to Morehead. This shift cost Morehead the support of many northern Whigs who, at the caucus meeting the night of December 11, declared that Morehead's election \"would ruin the Whig party in the North\",<ref name=holt471>Holt, p. 471</ref> especially if he gained the support of southern Democrats. Rather than further fracture the caucus, Morehead withdrew his name from consideration. Cobb was finally elected on the sixty-third ballot on December 22.<ref name=holt472>Holt, pp. 471&ndash;472</ref>\n\n===Governor of Kentucky===\nFollowing his congressional tenure, Morehead resumed his law practice and management of his plantations.<ref name=congbio/> In 1852, he was a [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] for [[Winfield Scott]], and in 1853, he served another term in the Kentucky House.<ref name=powell50/> By early 1855, sectional divisions had ripped apart the national Whig Party.<ref name=holt936>Holt, p.936</ref> In Kentucky, many former Whigs associated with the Know Nothing Party.<ref name=holt936/> Morehead was among these; he claimed that the Know Nothing Party was more \"Union\" than the Democratic Party.<ref name=ramage75/> The ex-Whigs hoped to take over the Know Nothing Party and reshape it into a Unionist Whig organization.<ref name=holt936/> Accordingly, when the Know Nothing candidate for governor, Judge William Loving, withdrew from the race due to failing health, the influx of ex-Whigs nominated Morehead to replace him for the gubernatorial election of 1855.<ref name=holt936/> Prior to the dissolution of the party, most had expected the Whigs would nominate Morehead at their own party's convention in April.<ref name=holt936/>\n\nThough Kentucky had only a small population of immigrants and Catholics, much of Morehead's campaign oratory was directed against these groups.<ref name=ramage75/> Most of the state's immigrant and Catholic population resided in Louisville, and tensions there reached a climax with an anti-foreign riot known as \"Bloody Monday\" on August 6, 1855.<ref name=powell50/> Morehead won the election with 69,816 votes to 65,413 votes for Democrat [[Beverly L. Clarke]].<ref name=harrison648/> In his inaugural address, Morehead denounced the [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]] of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] and despite his campaign rhetoric, proclaimed \"perfect equality\" for naturalized citizens.<ref name=ramage76>Ramage, p. 76</ref>\n\nMorehead's term as governor was an active one. He approved the appropriation of funding for the first Kentucky State Fair, which was seen as a vehicle for encouraging improvements in agriculture.<ref name=harrison648/> He also approved the formation of the Kentucky State Agricultural Society in 1856.<ref name=harrison648/> The state geological survey begun under Governor [[Lazarus W. Powell]] was completed and published.<ref name=harrison648/> [[Internal improvements]] progressed as well; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead's term.<ref name=ramage76/>\n\nKentucky's school system was expanding rapidly, creating a shortage of qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University made the transition from a private institution to a state-supported university. Money raised through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.<ref name=ramage76/>\n\nThe number of prisoners housed in the state penitentiary at Frankfort was also increasing. By 1856, 237 prisoners were detained in the facility which  had only 126 cells. Though state law required [[solitary confinement]] at night, the statute was impossible to administer due to the space constraints. Morehead cooperated with the legislature and developed a plan to expand the penitentiary to 252 cells. He also renegotiated the state's contract with the warden that was more favorable to the state, and allowed the warden to collect income from convict labor.<ref name=ramage77>Ramage, p. 77</ref>\n\nEarly in his term, Morehead approved two new bank charters, but he later vetoed several others, beginning with the proposed Bank of [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]].<ref name=ramage76/> Many other proposed bank charters died in the General Assembly.<ref name=ramage76/> The later years of Morehead's administration were hindered by the financial Panic of 1857.<ref name=harrison648/> In December 1857, he reported state expenditures of $21,000 for relief of the poor.<ref name=ramage76/>\n\n==Civil War and later life==\nMorehead moved to Louisville in 1859 and formed a law partnership with his nephew, Charles M. Briggs.<ref name=perrin90/> In February 1861, he attended the Peace Conference of 1861 that tried to resolve the sectional differences between the states.<ref name=harrison648/> In May 1861, he was chosen as a delegate to the Border State Convention, an ultimately futile attempt to avert the Civil War.<ref name=powell50/> Morehead refused to sign the final document produced by the convention because he did not agree with all the statements it contained.<ref name=powell50/> He was an advocate of Kentucky's position of neutrality, but was personally sympathetic to the South and was an outspoken critic of the Lincoln administration.<ref name=harrison648/> He condemned Secretary of State [[William H.

Barr were arrested for disloyalty.<ref name=silver171>Silver, p. 171</ref> The three were taken to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, and the next day, Louisville [[circuit court]] judge [[John Catron]] issued a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for Morehead.<ref name=silver171/> On September 24, the officer who had arrested Morehead told Catron that [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]] had already ordered Morehead taken to [[Fort Lafayette]] in [[New York Harbor]].<ref name=silver172>Silver, p. 172</ref> Shortly after this, a [[grand jury]] was convened but failed to return any charges against Morehead.<ref name=silver172/>\n\nMorehead was later transferred to [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in [[Boston Harbor]].<ref name=powell50/> He complained to his captors about the conditions in the prison; specifically, the difficulty of writing letters when confined with nine other men in a room that measured just ten feet by twenty feet.<ref name=hesseltine40>Hesseltine, p. 40</ref> Petitions for Morehead's release were delivered to President Lincoln, but Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward that Morehead and those arrested with them would be released \"when [[James Guthrie (American politician)|James Guthrie]] and [[James Speed]] [friends of Lincoln's in Kentucky] think they should be\".<ref name=silver172/> Later, Guthrie told Lincoln that Morehead's arrest had \"not been beneficial\" to their cause in Kentucky.<ref name=silver172/> Morehead was paroled on January 6, 1862, on the condition that he swear an oath not to take part in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] insurgence.<ref name=powell50/><ref name=silver172/> On March 19, 1862, he was unconditionally discharged from his parole.<ref name=powell50/>\n\nMorehead returned to his home in Louisville, but feared his refusal to take an oath of allegiance to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] would lead to another arrest.<ref name=powell50/> In June 1862, he fled to Canada, then to Europe, and finally to Mexico.<ref name=powell50/> Following the war, Morehead returned to the United States and lived on his plantation in [[Greenville, Mississippi]].<ref name=congbio/> He died there on December 21, 1868 and was buried on the grounds.<ref name=congbio/> On May 31, 1879, he was reburied in the [[Frankfort Cemetery]] in Frankfort, Kentucky.<ref name=powell50/>\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{commons category}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{CongBio|M000936}} Retrieved on 2009-04-01\n*{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Lowell H. |authorlink=Lowell H.

Some Visigothic nobles found refuge in the mountain areas of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Cantabria]]. The Christians began to regain control under the leadership of the nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias]], who founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in 718 and defeated the Muslims at the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in ca. 722, in what is taken by historians to be the beginning of the [[Reconquista]].

They progressively adopted a new culture, retaining little of their original culture except for practical military customs, some artistic modalities, family traditions such as heroic songs and folklore, as well as select conventions to include Germanic names still in use in present-day Spain. It is these artifacts of the original Visigothic culture that give ample evidence of its contributing foundation for the present regional culture.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=331-332}} Portraying themselves heirs of the Visigoths, the subsequent Christian Spanish monarchs declared their responsibility for the Reconquista of Muslim Spain, which was completed with the [[Fall of Granada]] in 1492.{{sfn|O'Callaghan}}\n\n====Ostrogoths====\n{{Main|Ostrogoths}}\n{{Further|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Tomb of Theodoric the Great Ravenna (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]]]\nAfter the Hunnic invasion, many Goths became subjects of the Huns.

By 493,{{sfn|Howatson|2011}} Theodoric had conquered all of Italy from the [[Scirii|Scirian]] [[Odoacer]], whom he killed with his own hands;{{sfn|Thompson}} he subsequently formed the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. Theodoric settled his entire people in Italy, estimated at 100,000-200,000, mostly in the northern part of the country, and ruled the country very efficiently. The Goths in Italy constituted a small minority of the population in the country.{{sfn|Paul|MacMullen}} Intermarriage between Goths and Romans were forbidden, and Romans were also forbidden from carrying arms. Nevertheless, the Roman majority was treated fairly.{{sfn|Thompson}}\n\nThe Goths were briefly reunited under one crown in the early 6th century under Theodoric, who became regent of the Visigothic kingdom following the death of [[Alaric II]] at the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 in 507.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=193}} Shortly after Theodoric's death, the country was invaded by the Eastern Roman Empire in the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]], which severely devastated and depopulated the Italian peninsula.{{sfn|London|1917|p=8}} The Ostrogoths made a brief resurgence under their king [[Totila]],{{sfn|Bennett|2004}} who was, however, killed at the [[Battle of Taginae]] in 552. After the last stand of the Ostrogothic king [[Teia]] at the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] in 553, Ostrogothic resistance ended, and the remaining Goths in Italy were assimilated by the [[Lombards]], another Germanic tribe, who invaded Italy and founded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] in 567.{{sfn|Bennett|2004}}{{sfn|Wickham|Foot}}\n\n====Crimean Goths====\n{{Main|Crimean Goths}}\n[[File:Mangup 10.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Ruins of the citadel of [[Doros (Crimea)|Doros]], capital of the Crimean Goths]]\nGothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea,{{sfn|Heather|2018}} especially in [[Crimea]], were known as the [[Crimean Goths]].

[[John of Gothia]], the [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Doros (Crimea)|Doros]], capital of the Crimean Goths, briefly expelled the Khazars from Crimea in the late 8th century, and was subsequently [[canonized]] as an [[List of Eastern Orthodox saints|Eastern Orthodox saint]].{{sfn|Vasiliev|1936|pp=117\u2013135}}\n\nIn the 10th century, the lands of the Crimean Goths were once again raided by the Khazars.

The majority of the individuals carried types of haplogroup H and U, and notably displayed higher frequencies of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5b]] (a typically [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] lineage) than preceding and succeeding populations in the area. They were found to be most closely related to Iron Age Scandinavian populations and the [[Bell Beaker culture]]. Strong genetic similarities with modern [[Scandinavians]], such as [[Norwegians]] and [[Swedes]], were detected. The males and females of Kowalewko were found to be of significantly different origins, with males displaying closer links to Iron Age Scandinavia and carrying higher amounts of [[steppe ancestry]] and hunter-gatherer ancestry than the females.{{sfn|Stolarek|2018}}\n\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 27 Goths buried at a Wielbark cemetery in [[Mas\u0142om\u0119cz]] from the 2nd to the 4th centuries. They were found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup H and U. The individuals displayed even closer genetic links to Iron Age Scandinavian populations than did those of Kowalewko. Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko. The results appeared to support the theory that the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and expanded southwards through the Wielbark culture towards the [[Black Sea]], where they mixed with local populations and established the Chernyakhov culture.{{sfn|Stolarek|2019}}\n\nA genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in 2019 examined the mtDNA of three Gothic females from the Chernyakhov culture. They carried haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H1|H1n6]], H1c and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2g1]] respectively. The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade.

By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434.

In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths.

Some Visigothic nobles found refuge in the mountain areas of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Cantabria]]. The Christians began to regain control under the leadership of the nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias]], who founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in 718 and defeated the Muslims at the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in ca. 722, in what is taken by historians to be the beginning of the [[Reconquista]].

They progressively adopted a new culture, retaining little of their original culture except for practical military customs, some artistic modalities, family traditions such as heroic songs and folklore, as well as select conventions to include Germanic names still in use in present-day Spain. It is these artifacts of the original Visigothic culture that give ample evidence of its contributing foundation for the present regional culture.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=331-332}} Portraying themselves heirs of the Visigoths, the subsequent Christian Spanish monarchs declared their responsibility for the Reconquista of Muslim Spain, which was completed with the [[Fall of Granada]] in 1492.{{sfn|O'Callaghan}}\n\n====Ostrogoths====\n{{Main|Ostrogoths}}\n{{Further|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Tomb of Theodoric the Great Ravenna (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]]]]\nAfter the Hunnic invasion, many Goths became subjects of the Huns.

By 493,{{sfn|Howatson|2011}} Theodoric had conquered all of Italy from the [[Scirii|Scirian]] [[Odoacer]], whom he killed with his own hands;{{sfn|Thompson}} he subsequently formed the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. Theodoric settled his entire people in Italy, estimated at 100,000-200,000, mostly in the northern part of the country, and ruled the country very efficiently. The Goths in Italy constituted a small minority of the population in the country.{{sfn|Paul|MacMullen}} Intermarriage between Goths and Romans were forbidden, and Romans were also forbidden from carrying arms. Nevertheless, the Roman majority was treated fairly.{{sfn|Thompson}}\n\nThe Goths were briefly reunited under one crown in the early 6th century under Theodoric, who became regent of the Visigothic kingdom following the death of [[Alaric II]] at the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 in 507.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=193}} Shortly after Theodoric's death, the country was invaded by the Eastern Roman Empire in the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]], which severely devastated and depopulated the Italian peninsula.{{sfn|London|1917|p=8}} The Ostrogoths made a brief resurgence under their king [[Totila]],{{sfn|Bennett|2004}} who was, however, killed at the [[Battle of Taginae]] in 552. After the last stand of the Ostrogothic king [[Teia]] at the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] in 553, Ostrogothic resistance ended, and the remaining Goths in Italy were assimilated by the [[Lombards]], another Germanic tribe, who invaded Italy and founded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] in 567.{{sfn|Bennett|2004}}{{sfn|Wickham|Foot}}\n\n====Crimean Goths====\n{{Main|Crimean Goths}}\n[[File:Mangup 10.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Ruins of the citadel of [[Doros (Crimea)|Doros]], capital of the Crimean Goths]]\nGothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea,{{sfn|Heather|2018}} especially in [[Crimea]], were known as the [[Crimean Goths]].

[[John of Gothia]], the [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Doros (Crimea)|Doros]], capital of the Crimean Goths, briefly expelled the Khazars from Crimea in the late 8th century, and was subsequently [[canonized]] as an [[List of Eastern Orthodox saints|Eastern Orthodox saint]].{{sfn|Vasiliev|1936|pp=117\u2013135}}\n\nIn the 10th century, the lands of the Crimean Goths were once again raided by the Khazars.

The majority of the individuals carried types of haplogroup H and U, and notably displayed higher frequencies of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5b]] (a typically [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] lineage) than preceding and succeeding populations in the area. They were found to be most closely related to Iron Age Scandinavian populations and the [[Bell Beaker culture]]. Strong genetic similarities with modern [[Scandinavians]], such as [[Norwegians]] and [[Swedes]], were detected. The males and females of Kowalewko were found to be of significantly different origins, with males displaying closer links to Iron Age Scandinavia and carrying higher amounts of [[steppe ancestry]] and hunter-gatherer ancestry than the females.{{sfn|Stolarek|2018}}\n\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 27 Goths buried at a Wielbark cemetery in [[Mas\u0142om\u0119cz]] from the 2nd to the 4th centuries. They were found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup H and U. The individuals displayed even closer genetic links to Iron Age Scandinavian populations than did those of Kowalewko. Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko. The results appeared to support the theory that the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and expanded southwards through the Wielbark culture towards the [[Black Sea]], where they mixed with local populations and established the Chernyakhov culture.{{sfn|Stolarek|2019}}\n\nA genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in 2019 examined the mtDNA of three Gothic females from the Chernyakhov culture. They carried haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H1|H1n6]], H1c and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2g1]] respectively. The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Ulfilas]] explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it.

By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434.

In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths.
