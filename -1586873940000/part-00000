(Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2. Magnum is also frequently assisted by two former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], Rick Wright and TC Calvin.

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2. Magnum is also frequently assisted by two former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], Rick Wright and TC Calvin. Rick is now a bar owner, while TC is a pilot whose main business is running helicopter tours of the islands. Magnum tends to butt heads with HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, but the two also help each other when needed.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as [[Thomas Magnum]], a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who is a security consultant for the successful novelist Robin Masters, living in the guest house on his estate, while also working as a [[private investigator]]\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as [[Jonathan Higgins#2018 reboot|Juliet Higgins]], a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent who is [[majordomo]] to Robin Masters; she and Magnum bicker but become allies\n* [[Zachary Knighton]] as Orville \"Rick\" Wright, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] veteran and former [[door gunner]], who runs his own [[tiki bar]] and is also a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]]\n* Stephen Hill as Theodore \"TC\" Calvin, a Marine veteran and [[helicopter]] pilot who runs helicopter tours of Hawaii and is a member of Magnum's team\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Teuila \"Kumu\" Tuileta, the cultural [[curator]] of Robin Masters' estate\n* [[Tim Kang]] as HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, who dislikes Magnum but usually comes to the team's aid when needed\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James Remar]] as Captain Buck Greene, Magnum's former C.O.\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Sebastian Nuzo, Magnum's friend who was killed in the pilot but recurs in flashbacks\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Francis \"Icepick\" Hofstetler, Rick's underworld-connected father figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |title=Corbin Bernsen Cast on ''Magnum P.I.'' as [Spoiler]'s Degenerate Father Figure |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123200751/https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |archive-date=November 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bernsen guest starred in [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0 ]] in another part.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Luther H.

Achilles leads his [[Myrmidons]] along with the rest of the Greek army invading the historical city of [[Troy]], defended by Hector's Trojan army. The end of the film (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the ''Iliad'', but rather from [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]'s ''[[Posthomerica]]'' as the ''Iliad'' concludes with Hector's death and funeral.\n\nTroy made over $497 million worldwide, temporarily placing it in the #60 spot of top box office hits of all time. It received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] and was the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|8th highest-grossing film of 2004]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2004&p=.htm |title=2004 Worldwide Grosses |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA battle between the armies of King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]] and King [[Triopas]] of [[Thessaly]] is averted when the great warrior [[Achilles]], fighting for Agamemnon, defeats Boagrius, Triopas' champion, in single combat. Thessaly joins Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms.\n\nPrince [[Hector]] of [[Troy]] and his younger brother [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] negotiate a peace treaty with [[Menelaus]], King of [[Sparta]]. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Agamemnon has [[Odysseus]], King of [[Ithaca]], persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go after his mother [[Thetis]] tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.\n\nIn Troy, King [[Priam]] is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his [[Myrmidons]]. Achilles has the temple of [[Apollo]] sacked, and claims [[Briseis]] \u2014 a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector \u2014 as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.\n\nThe Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris, causing him to cower behind Hector; when Menelaus attempts to kill Paris despite his victory, he himself is killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of [[Patroclus]], his cousin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nDespite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and kills him, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, both armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife [[Andromache]] a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].\n\nThe next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve-day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.\n\nAgamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a [[Trojan Horse|gigantic wooden horse]] as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Despite objections from Paris who requests for it to be burned down, Priam orders the horse be brought into the city after Archeptolemus views it as a gift intended for calming the gods. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the [[Sack of Troy]]. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to a young boy named [[Aeneas]], instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them [[Rome|a new home]]. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through [[Achilles' heel]] and then several into his body. Achilles extracts all the arrows but the one in his heel.  He then bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.\n\nIn the aftermath, Troy is finally taken by the Greeks and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus Boagrius named in plot summary, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Achilles]], Greece's greatest warrior and leader of the Myrmidons\n* [[Eric Bana]] as [[Hector]], Crown Prince of Troy and commander of the Trojan armies\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of Troy and Hector's younger brother\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], former Queen of Sparta who became a Princess of Troy\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Agamemnon]], King of the united Greek city-states\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Odysseus]], King of Ithaca\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Menelaus]], King of Sparta and younger brother of Agamemnon\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as [[Andromache]], Hector's wife and Crown Princess of Troy\n* [[Julie Christie]] as [[Thetis]], Achilles' mother\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Priam]], King of Troy\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as [[Briseis]], priestess of the Trojan Temple of Apollo\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as [[Patroclus]], Achilles' younger cousin\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], Agemememnon's advisor\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as Archeptolemus, the Trojan high priest\n* [[James Cosmo]] as [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], second-in command of the Trojan armies\n* [[Julian Glover]] as [[Triopas]], King of Thessaly\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as [[Eudorus]], Achilles' right-hand man of the Myrmdions\n* [[Trevor Eve]] as Velior\n* [[Tyler Mane]] as [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]\n* [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] as Boagrius, Triopas' champion\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe city of Troy was built in the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Malta]] at [[Fort Ricasoli]] from April to June 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,633152,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=MEN AND MYTHS | date=May 2004 | accessdate=2012-02-20 | first1=Gillian | last1=Flynn}}</ref>  Other important scenes were shot in [[Mellie\u0127a]], a small town in the north of [[Malta]], and on the small island of [[Comino]].

So I was put in ''Troy.'' It wasn\u2019t painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it.

[[Tanja Carovska]] provided vocals on various portions of the music, as she later would on composer James Horner's version of the soundtrack. However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thescreamonline.com/film/film4-3/yared.html |title=The Score of Troy - A Mystery Unveiled: by Gabriel Yared |publisher=TheScreamOnline.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> [[James Horner]] composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska's vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter [[Josh Groban]] and lyricist [[Cynthia Weil]] to write an original song for the film's end credits. The product of this collaboration, \"Remember\" was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004 through [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Director's cut==\n''Troy: Director's Cut'' was screened at the [[57th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 17, 2007 and received a [[limited release]] in [[Germany]] in April 2007. [[Warner Home Video]] reportedly spent more than $1 million for the [[director's cut]], which includes \"at least 1,000 new cuts\" or almost 30 minutes extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007 in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of [[Danny Elfman]]'s theme for ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy.\n\nVarious shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, showing much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were given more time to develop, specifically [[Priam]] and [[Odysseus]], the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier's dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to [[Mount Ida]]. In one of the commentary sequences, the film's writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow ''The Iliad'' or to do what was best for the film, they always decided with what was best for the film.\n\n== Home media ==\nTroy was released on DVD on January 4, 2005<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy|date=2005-01-04|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Brad-Pitt/dp/B0002Z0EYK|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> The Director's  cut was released on Blu-Ray & DVD on September 18, 2007<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy: Director's Cut|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Special-Blu-ray/dp/B000TGGJKU/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_74_t_1/140-4514335-5977559?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WW2ZD1VV7DTFXNZZ0V42|publisher=Warner Brothers|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Troy|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B000TGJ8IU/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1515020966&sr=1-2&keywords=Troy++Directors+Cut&refinements=p_n_format_browse-bin:2650304011|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>  The Directors Cut is the only edition of the film available on Blu-Ray, however the theatrical cut was released on HD-DVD.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Commercial performance===\nWhen the film was completed, total production costs were approximately $185 million.

Achilles leads his [[Myrmidons]] along with the rest of the Greek army invading the historical city of [[Troy]], defended by Hector's Trojan army. The end of the film (the sack of Troy) is not taken from the ''Iliad'', but rather from [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]'s ''[[Posthomerica]]'' as the ''Iliad'' concludes with Hector's death and funeral.\n\nTroy made over $497 million worldwide, temporarily placing it in the #60 spot of top box office hits of all time. It received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] and was the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|8th highest-grossing film of 2004]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2004&p=.htm |title=2004 Worldwide Grosses |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA battle between the armies of King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]] and King [[Triopas]] of [[Thessaly]] is averted when the great warrior [[Achilles]], fighting for Agamemnon, defeats Boagrius, Triopas' champion, in single combat. Thessaly joins Agamemnon's loose alliance of all the Greek kingdoms.\n\nPrince [[Hector]] of [[Troy]] and his younger brother [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] negotiate a peace treaty with [[Menelaus]], King of [[Sparta]]. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Agamemnon has [[Odysseus]], King of [[Ithaca]], persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go after his mother [[Thetis]] tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.\n\nIn Troy, King [[Priam]] is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his [[Myrmidons]]. Achilles has the temple of [[Apollo]] sacked, and claims [[Briseis]] \u2014 a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector \u2014 as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.\n\nThe Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris, causing him to cower behind Hector; when Menelaus attempts to kill Paris despite his victory, he himself is killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of [[Patroclus]], his cousin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nDespite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and kills him, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, both armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife [[Andromache]] a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].\n\nThe next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve-day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.\n\nAgamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a [[Trojan Horse|gigantic wooden horse]] as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Despite objections from Paris who requests for it to be burned down, Priam orders the horse be brought into the city after Archeptolemus views it as a gift intended for calming the gods. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the [[Sack of Troy]]. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to a young boy named [[Aeneas]], instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them [[Rome|a new home]]. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through [[Achilles' heel]] and then several into his body. Achilles extracts all the arrows but the one in his heel.  He then bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.\n\nIn the aftermath, Troy is finally taken by the Greeks and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus Boagrius named in plot summary, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Achilles]], Greece's greatest warrior and leader of the Myrmidons\n* [[Eric Bana]] as [[Hector]], Crown Prince of Troy and commander of the Trojan armies\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of Troy and Hector's younger brother\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], former Queen of Sparta who became a Princess of Troy\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Agamemnon]], King of the united Greek city-states\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[Odysseus]], King of Ithaca\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Menelaus]], King of Sparta and younger brother of Agamemnon\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as [[Andromache]], Hector's wife and Crown Princess of Troy\n* [[Julie Christie]] as [[Thetis]], Achilles' mother\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Priam]], King of Troy\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as [[Briseis]], priestess of the Trojan Temple of Apollo\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as [[Patroclus]], Achilles' younger cousin\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], Agemememnon's advisor\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as Archeptolemus, the Trojan high priest\n* [[James Cosmo]] as [[Glaucus (soldier)|Glaucus]], second-in command of the Trojan armies\n* [[Julian Glover]] as [[Triopas]], King of Thessaly\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as [[Eudorus]], Achilles' right-hand man of the Myrmdions\n* [[Trevor Eve]] as Velior\n* [[Tyler Mane]] as [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]\n* [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] as Boagrius, Triopas' champion\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe city of Troy was built in the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Malta]] at [[Fort Ricasoli]] from April to June 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,633152,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=MEN AND MYTHS | date=May 2004 | accessdate=2012-02-20 | first1=Gillian | last1=Flynn}}</ref>  Other important scenes were shot in [[Mellie\u0127a]], a small town in the north of [[Malta]], and on the small island of [[Comino]].

However, the reactions at test screenings which used an incomplete version of the score were negative, and in less than a day Yared was off the project without a chance to fix or change his music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thescreamonline.com/film/film4-3/yared.html |title=The Score of Troy - A Mystery Unveiled: by Gabriel Yared |publisher=TheScreamOnline.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> [[James Horner]] composed a replacement score in about four weeks. He used Carovska's vocals again and also included traditional Eastern Mediterranean music and brass instruments. Horner also collaborated with American singer-songwriter [[Josh Groban]] and lyricist [[Cynthia Weil]] to write an original song for the film's end credits. The product of this collaboration, \"Remember\" was performed by Groban with additional vocals by Carovska.\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was released on May 11, 2004 through [[Reprise Records]].\n\n==Director's cut==\n''Troy: Director's Cut'' was screened at the [[57th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 17, 2007 and received a [[limited release]] in [[Germany]] in April 2007. [[Warner Home Video]] reportedly spent more than $1 million for the [[director's cut]], which includes \"at least 1,000 new cuts\" or almost 30 minutes extra footage (with a new running time of 196 minutes). The DVD was released on September 18, 2007 in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of [[Danny Elfman]]'s theme for ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy.\n\nVarious shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, showing much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were given more time to develop, specifically [[Priam]] and [[Odysseus]], the latter being given a humorous introduction scene. Lastly, bookend scenes were added: the beginning being a soldier's dog finding its dead master and the end including a sequence where the few surviving Trojans escape to [[Mount Ida]]. In one of the commentary sequences, the film's writer, David Benioff, said that when it came to deciding whether to follow ''The Iliad'' or to do what was best for the film, they always decided with what was best for the film.\n\n== Home media ==\nTroy was released on DVD on January 4, 2005<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy|date=2005-01-04|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Brad-Pitt/dp/B0002Z0EYK|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> The Director's  cut was released on Blu-Ray & DVD on September 18, 2007<ref>{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Wolfgang|title=Troy: Director's Cut|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Special-Blu-ray/dp/B000TGGJKU/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_74_t_1/140-4514335-5977559?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=WW2ZD1VV7DTFXNZZ0V42|publisher=Warner Brothers|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Troy|date=2007-09-18|url=https://www.amazon.com/Troy-Directors-Cut-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B000TGJ8IU/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1515020966&sr=1-2&keywords=Troy++Directors+Cut&refinements=p_n_format_browse-bin:2650304011|publisher=Warner Home Video|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>  The Directors Cut is the only edition of the film available on Blu-Ray, however the theatrical cut was released on HD-DVD.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Commercial performance===\nWhen the film was completed, total production costs were approximately $185 million.

With Parliament offering them a financial incentive, three of Charlotte's uncles, sons of George III, were prepared to marry.

Shortly after their marriage, the Kents moved to [[Germany]], where the cost of living would be cheaper. Soon after, Victoria became pregnant, and the Duke and Duchess, determined to have their child born in England, raced back.{{sfn|Hibbert|2000|pp=9\u201310}}{{sfn|Gill|2009|p=34}} Arriving at Dover on 23 April 1819, they moved into [[Kensington Palace]], where Victoria gave birth to a daughter on 24 May 1819, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, later [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name=odnb/> An efficient organiser, Sir [[John Conroy]]'s planning ensured the Kents' speedy return to England in time for the birth of their first child.{{sfn|Longford|2004}}\n\n==Widowhood==\n[[File:Vicky of Kent.jpg|thumb|right|The Duchess of Kent by [[Sir George Hayter]] in 1835]]\nThe Duke of Kent died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in January 1820, six days before his father, [[King George III]].<ref name=odnb/> His widow the Duchess had little cause to remain in the United Kingdom, since she did not speak the language and had a palace at home in Coburg where she could live cheaply on the revenues of her first husband. However, the British succession at this time was far from assured&nbsp;\u2013 of the three brothers older than Edward, the new king, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], and the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] were both estranged from their wives, who were in any case past childbearing age. The third brother, the Duke of Clarence, had yet to produce any surviving children with his wife. The Duchess of Kent decided that she would do better by gambling on her daughter's accession than by living quietly in Coburg and, having inherited her second husband's debts, sought support from the British government. After the death of Edward and his father, the young Princess Victoria was still only third in line for the throne, and [[British Parliament|Parliament]] was not inclined to support yet more impoverished royalty. \n\nThe provision made for the Duchess of Kent was mean: she resided in a suite of rooms in the dilapidated [[Kensington Palace]], along with several other impoverished members of the royal family, and received little financial support from the [[Civil List]], since Parliament had vivid memories of the late Duke's extravagance.  In practice, a main source of support for her was her brother, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]]. The latter had a huge income of fifty thousand pounds per annum for life, representing an annuity allotted to him by the British Parliament on his marriage to Princess Charlotte, which had made him seem likely to become in due course the consort of the monarch.{{sfn|Chambers|p=164}} Even after Charlotte's death, Leopold's annuity was not revoked by Parliament.\n\nIn 1831, with George IV dead and the new king [[William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom|William IV]] (formerly the Duke of Clarence) being over 60 without any surviving legitimate issue, and whose nearly 40-year-old wife was considered to be at the end of childbearing age, the young princess's status as [[heir presumptive]] and the Duchess's prospective place as [[regent]] led to major increases in British state income for the Kents. A contributing factor was Leopold's designation as [[King of the Belgians]], upon which he surrendered his British income.\n\n==Royal feud==\n[[File:Duchess of Kent and Victoria by Henry Bone.jpg|thumb|left|The Duchess of Kent with her daughter, the future [[Queen Victoria]]]]\nTogether in a hostile environment,{{sfn|Longford|2004}}{{#tag:ref|A German, the Duchess of Kent was unpopular in England, and did not mix well with the British royal family.{{sfn|Vallone|2001|p=63}}|group=note}} [[John Conroy]]'s relationship with the Duchess was very close, with him serving as her [[comptroller]] and private secretary for the next nineteen years,{{sfn|Hough|1996|p=20}} as well as holding the unofficial roles of public relations officer, counsellor, confidant and political agent.{{sfn|Gill|2009|p=47}} While it is not clear which of the two was more responsible for devising the [[Kensington System]],{{sfn|Hough|1996|p=20}} it was created to govern young Victoria's upbringing. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed [[regent]] upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.{{sfn|Longford|2004}} The Duchess and Conroy continued to be unpopular with the royal family and, in 1829, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]] spread rumours that they were lovers in an attempt to discredit them.<ref>Hibbert, p. 27; Longford, pp. 35\u201338, 118\u2013119; St Aubyn, pp. 21\u201322; Woodham-Smith, pp. 70\u201372. The rumours were false in the opinion of these biographers.</ref> The [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] referred to Conroy as \"King John\",{{sfn|Longford|2004}} while the [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Duchess of Clarence]] wrote to the Duchess of Kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from the royal family and that she must not grant Conroy too much power.{{sfn|Williams|2010|pp=211\u201312}}{{sfn|Hibbert|2001|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nThe Duchess of Kent was extremely protective, and raised Victoria largely isolated from other children under the so-called \"Kensington System\". The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them.<ref>Hibbert, pp. 27\u201328; Waller, pp. 341\u2013342; Woodham-Smith, pp. 63\u201365</ref> The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children,<ref>Hibbert, pp. 32\u201333; Longford, pp. 38\u201339, 55; Marshall, p. 19</ref> and perhaps prompted the emergence of [[Victorian morality]] by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.<ref>[[Robert Lacey|Lacey, Robert]] (2006) ''Great Tales from English History, Volume 3'', London: Little, Brown, and Company, {{ISBN|0-316-11459-6}}, pp. 133\u2013136</ref> Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her [[King Charles Spaniel]], [[Dash (spaniel)|Dash]].<ref>Waller, pp. 338\u2013341; Woodham-Smith, pp. 68\u201369, 91</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of Conroy's influence, the relationship between the Duchess's household and King William IV soon soured, with the Duchess regarding the King as an oversexed oaf.<ref>Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.152. Penguin Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-7394-2025-9}}.</ref> As far as she dared, the Duchess denied the King access to his niece. She prevented her daughter from attending William's coronation out of a disagreement of precedence,{{#tag:ref|King William ordered that Victoria follow his brothers down the aisle during the coronation. The Duchess interpreted this as a deliberate slight.{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=226}}|group=note}} a decision attributed by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] to Conroy.{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=227}}{{sfn|Hibbert|2001|p=33}} In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents.{{sfn|Rappaport|2003|p=101}}{{sfn|Williams|2010|pp=218\u201320}} Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship.{{sfn|Barrow|1831|p=242}}{{sfn|Vallone|2001|p=72}}\n\nThe Duchess further offended the King by taking rooms in Kensington Palace that the King had reserved for himself. Both before and during William's reign, she snubbed his illegitimate children, the [[William IV of the United Kingdom#Illegitimate|FitzClarences]]. Both the King and his wife [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] were fond of their niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said,\n<blockquote>\nI trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer&nbsp;... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.<ref>Somerset, p. 209.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.<ref>Allen, p.225</ref>\n\nConroy had high hopes for his patroness and himself: He envisaged Victoria succeeding the throne at a young age, thus needing a [[Regent|regency]] government, which, following the [[Regency Act 1830]], would be headed by the princess's mother (who had already served in that capacity in Germany following the death of her first husband).<ref>Hibbert, p. 31; St Aubyn, p. 26; Woodham-Smith, p. 81</ref> As the personal secretary of the Duchess, Conroy would be the veritable \"power behind the throne\". He had not counted on  William IV surviving long enough for Victoria to succeed to the throne as an adult and consequently, while cultivating her mother, had shown little consideration for Victoria. When the latter succeeded, Conroy risked having no influence over her. He tried to force Victoria to agree to make him her personal secretary once she succeeded, but this plan, too, backfired.  Victoria resented her mother's support for Conroy's schemes and being  pressured by her to sign a paper declaring Conroy her personal secretary. The result was that when Victoria became queen, she relegated the Duchess to separate accommodations, away from her own.{{sfn|Gill|2009|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n==Reconciliation==\n[[File:N-W0001-053-portrait-of-marie-louise-victoria-duchess-of-kent.jpg|thumb|The Duchess of Kent in a portrait by Winterhalter]]\nWhen the Queen's first child, the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]], was born, the Duchess of Kent unexpectedly found herself welcomed back into Victoria's inner circle. It is likely that this came about as a result of the dismissal of [[Baroness Lehzen]] at the behest of Victoria's husband (and the Duchess's nephew), [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. Firstly, this removed Lehzen's influence, and Lehzen had long despised the Duchess and Conroy, suspecting them of an illicit affair. Secondly, it left the Queen wholly open to Albert's influence, and he likely prevailed upon her to reconcile with her mother. Thirdly, Conroy by now lived in exile on the Continent and so his divisive influence was removed. The Duchess's finances, which had been left in shambles by Conroy, were restored thanks to Victoria and her advisors. By all accounts, the Duchess became a doting grandmother and was closer to her daughter than she ever had been.<ref>Packard, p. 85</ref>\n\n==Rumours of affairs==\n{{See also|Legitimacy of Queen Victoria}}\n\nSome historians, including [[A. N. Wilson]], suggested that Victoria's father could not have been the Duke of Kent. Those who promote this position point to the absence of [[porphyria]] in the British royal family among the descendants of Queen Victoria \u2013 it had been widespread before her; and [[haemophilia]], unknown in either the Duke's or Duchess's family, had arisen among the best documented families in history.<ref>A. N. Wilson, ''The Victorians'' (Hutchinson, 2002). {{ISBN|0-09-179421-8}}, page 25</ref>\n\nIn practice, this would have required the Duchess's lover to be [[haemophiliac]]&nbsp;\u2013 an extremely unlikely survival, given the poor state of medicine at the time,<ref name=packard>Packard, Jerrold (1973).  ''Victoria's Daughters''.  New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 43-44</ref> or the Duchess herself to be a carrier of haemophilia, since haemophilia is [[X-linked]], meaning that her mother would have been a carrier, if haemophilia was not otherwise previously expressed in the Duchess's parents.<ref name=packard/> Actual evidence to support this theory has not arisen, and haemophilia occurs spontaneously through mutation in at least 30% of cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hemophilia.org/NHFWeb/MainPgs/MainNHF.aspx?menuid=181&contentid=46&rptname=bleeding|title=Hemophilia B (Factor IX)|publisher=National Hemophilia Foundation|year=2006|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn R\u00f6hl's book, ''Purple Secret'', documents evidence of [[porphyria]] in [[Victoria, Princess Royal]]'s daughter [[Princess Charlotte of Prussia|Charlotte]], and her granddaughter, [[Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen|Feodora]].<ref name=rohl>[[John C.

With Parliament offering them a financial incentive, three of Charlotte's uncles, sons of George III, were prepared to marry. One of them, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]] (1767\u20131820) proposed to Victoria and she accepted.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB |id=101008526 |first=Elizabeth |last=Longford |title=Edward, Prince, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767\u20131820) |date=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101008526/Prince-Edward}}</ref> The couple were married on 29 May 1818 at [[Amorbach]] and on 11 July 1818 at [[Kew]], a joint ceremony at which Edward's brother, the Duke of Clarence, later [[King William IV]], married [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]]. Shortly after their marriage, the Kents moved to [[Germany]], where the cost of living would be cheaper. Soon after, Victoria became pregnant, and the Duke and Duchess, determined to have their child born in England, raced back.{{sfn|Hibbert|2000|pp=9\u201310}}{{sfn|Gill|2009|p=34}} Arriving at Dover on 23 April 1819, they moved into [[Kensington Palace]], where Victoria gave birth to a daughter on 24 May 1819, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, later [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name=odnb/> An efficient organiser, Sir [[John Conroy]]'s planning ensured the Kents' speedy return to England in time for the birth of their first child.{{sfn|Longford|2004}}\n\n==Widowhood==\n[[File:Vicky of Kent.jpg|thumb|right|The Duchess of Kent by [[Sir George Hayter]] in 1835]]\nThe Duke of Kent died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in January 1820, six days before his father, [[King George III]].<ref name=odnb/> His widow the Duchess had little cause to remain in the United Kingdom, since she did not speak the language and had a palace at home in Coburg where she could live cheaply on the revenues of her first husband. However, the British succession at this time was far from assured&nbsp;\u2013 of the three brothers older than Edward, the new king, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], and the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] were both estranged from their wives, who were in any case past childbearing age. The third brother, the Duke of Clarence, had yet to produce any surviving children with his wife. The Duchess of Kent decided that she would do better by gambling on her daughter's accession than by living quietly in Coburg and, having inherited her second husband's debts, sought support from the British government. After the death of Edward and his father, the young Princess Victoria was still only third in line for the throne, and [[British Parliament|Parliament]] was not inclined to support yet more impoverished royalty. \n\nThe provision made for the Duchess of Kent was mean: she resided in a suite of rooms in the dilapidated [[Kensington Palace]], along with several other impoverished members of the royal family, and received little financial support from the [[Civil List]], since Parliament had vivid memories of the late Duke's extravagance.  In practice, a main source of support for her was her brother, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]]. The latter had a huge income of fifty thousand pounds per annum for life, representing an annuity allotted to him by the British Parliament on his marriage to Princess Charlotte, which had made him seem likely to become in due course the consort of the monarch.{{sfn|Chambers|p=164}} Even after Charlotte's death, Leopold's annuity was not revoked by Parliament.\n\nIn 1831, with George IV dead and the new king [[William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom|William IV]] (formerly the Duke of Clarence) being over 60 without any surviving legitimate issue, and whose nearly 40-year-old wife was considered to be at the end of childbearing age, the young princess's status as [[heir presumptive]] and the Duchess's prospective place as [[regent]] led to major increases in British state income for the Kents. A contributing factor was Leopold's designation as [[King of the Belgians]], upon which he surrendered his British income.\n\n==Royal feud==\n[[File:Duchess of Kent and Victoria by Henry Bone.jpg|thumb|left|The Duchess of Kent with her daughter, the future [[Queen Victoria]]]]\nTogether in a hostile environment,{{sfn|Longford|2004}}{{#tag:ref|A German, the Duchess of Kent was unpopular in England, and did not mix well with the British royal family.{{sfn|Vallone|2001|p=63}}|group=note}} [[John Conroy]]'s relationship with the Duchess was very close, with him serving as her [[comptroller]] and private secretary for the next nineteen years,{{sfn|Hough|1996|p=20}} as well as holding the unofficial roles of public relations officer, counsellor, confidant and political agent.{{sfn|Gill|2009|p=47}} While it is not clear which of the two was more responsible for devising the [[Kensington System]],{{sfn|Hough|1996|p=20}} it was created to govern young Victoria's upbringing. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed [[regent]] upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.{{sfn|Longford|2004}} The Duchess and Conroy continued to be unpopular with the royal family and, in 1829, the [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]] spread rumours that they were lovers in an attempt to discredit them.<ref>Hibbert, p. 27; Longford, pp. 35\u201338, 118\u2013119; St Aubyn, pp. 21\u201322; Woodham-Smith, pp. 70\u201372. The rumours were false in the opinion of these biographers.</ref> The [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] referred to Conroy as \"King John\",{{sfn|Longford|2004}} while the [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Duchess of Clarence]] wrote to the Duchess of Kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from the royal family and that she must not grant Conroy too much power.{{sfn|Williams|2010|pp=211\u201312}}{{sfn|Hibbert|2001|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nThe Duchess of Kent was extremely protective, and raised Victoria largely isolated from other children under the so-called \"Kensington System\". The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them.<ref>Hibbert, pp. 27\u201328; Waller, pp. 341\u2013342; Woodham-Smith, pp. 63\u201365</ref> The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children,<ref>Hibbert, pp. 32\u201333; Longford, pp. 38\u201339, 55; Marshall, p. 19</ref> and perhaps prompted the emergence of [[Victorian morality]] by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety.<ref>[[Robert Lacey|Lacey, Robert]] (2006) ''Great Tales from English History, Volume 3'', London: Little, Brown, and Company, {{ISBN|0-316-11459-6}}, pp. 133\u2013136</ref> Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her [[King Charles Spaniel]], [[Dash (spaniel)|Dash]].<ref>Waller, pp. 338\u2013341; Woodham-Smith, pp. 68\u201369, 91</ref>\n\nPerhaps because of Conroy's influence, the relationship between the Duchess's household and King William IV soon soured, with the Duchess regarding the King as an oversexed oaf.<ref>Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.152. Penguin Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-7394-2025-9}}.</ref> As far as she dared, the Duchess denied the King access to his niece. She prevented her daughter from attending William's coronation out of a disagreement of precedence,{{#tag:ref|King William ordered that Victoria follow his brothers down the aisle during the coronation. The Duchess interpreted this as a deliberate slight.{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=226}}|group=note}} a decision attributed by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] to Conroy.{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=227}}{{sfn|Hibbert|2001|p=33}} In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents.{{sfn|Rappaport|2003|p=101}}{{sfn|Williams|2010|pp=218\u201320}} Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship.{{sfn|Barrow|1831|p=242}}{{sfn|Vallone|2001|p=72}}\n\nThe Duchess further offended the King by taking rooms in Kensington Palace that the King had reserved for himself. Both before and during William's reign, she snubbed his illegitimate children, the [[William IV of the United Kingdom#Illegitimate|FitzClarences]]. Both the King and his wife [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] were fond of their niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said,\n<blockquote>\nI trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer&nbsp;... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.<ref>Somerset, p. 209.</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe breach between the Duchess and the King and Queen was never fully healed, but Victoria always viewed both of them with kindness.<ref>Allen, p.225</ref>\n\nConroy had high hopes for his patroness and himself: He envisaged Victoria succeeding the throne at a young age, thus needing a [[Regent|regency]] government, which, following the [[Regency Act 1830]], would be headed by the princess's mother (who had already served in that capacity in Germany following the death of her first husband).<ref>Hibbert, p. 31; St Aubyn, p. 26; Woodham-Smith, p. 81</ref> As the personal secretary of the Duchess, Conroy would be the veritable \"power behind the throne\". He had not counted on  William IV surviving long enough for Victoria to succeed to the throne as an adult and consequently, while cultivating her mother, had shown little consideration for Victoria. When the latter succeeded, Conroy risked having no influence over her. He tried to force Victoria to agree to make him her personal secretary once she succeeded, but this plan, too, backfired.  Victoria resented her mother's support for Conroy's schemes and being  pressured by her to sign a paper declaring Conroy her personal secretary. The result was that when Victoria became queen, she relegated the Duchess to separate accommodations, away from her own.{{sfn|Gill|2009|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n==Reconciliation==\n[[File:N-W0001-053-portrait-of-marie-louise-victoria-duchess-of-kent.jpg|thumb|The Duchess of Kent in a portrait by Winterhalter]]\nWhen the Queen's first child, the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]], was born, the Duchess of Kent unexpectedly found herself welcomed back into Victoria's inner circle. It is likely that this came about as a result of the dismissal of [[Baroness Lehzen]] at the behest of Victoria's husband (and the Duchess's nephew), [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. Firstly, this removed Lehzen's influence, and Lehzen had long despised the Duchess and Conroy, suspecting them of an illicit affair. Secondly, it left the Queen wholly open to Albert's influence, and he likely prevailed upon her to reconcile with her mother. Thirdly, Conroy by now lived in exile on the Continent and so his divisive influence was removed. The Duchess's finances, which had been left in shambles by Conroy, were restored thanks to Victoria and her advisors. By all accounts, the Duchess became a doting grandmother and was closer to her daughter than she ever had been.<ref>Packard, p. 85</ref>\n\n==Rumours of affairs==\n{{See also|Legitimacy of Queen Victoria}}\n\nSome historians, including [[A. N. Wilson]], suggested that Victoria's father could not have been the Duke of Kent. Those who promote this position point to the absence of [[porphyria]] in the British royal family among the descendants of Queen Victoria \u2013 it had been widespread before her; and [[haemophilia]], unknown in either the Duke's or Duchess's family, had arisen among the best documented families in history.<ref>A. N. Wilson, ''The Victorians'' (Hutchinson, 2002). {{ISBN|0-09-179421-8}}, page 25</ref>\n\nIn practice, this would have required the Duchess's lover to be [[haemophiliac]]&nbsp;\u2013 an extremely unlikely survival, given the poor state of medicine at the time,<ref name=packard>Packard, Jerrold (1973).  ''Victoria's Daughters''.  New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 43-44</ref> or the Duchess herself to be a carrier of haemophilia, since haemophilia is [[X-linked]], meaning that her mother would have been a carrier, if haemophilia was not otherwise previously expressed in the Duchess's parents.<ref name=packard/> Actual evidence to support this theory has not arisen, and haemophilia occurs spontaneously through mutation in at least 30% of cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hemophilia.org/NHFWeb/MainPgs/MainNHF.aspx?menuid=181&contentid=46&rptname=bleeding|title=Hemophilia B (Factor IX)|publisher=National Hemophilia Foundation|year=2006|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn R\u00f6hl's book, ''Purple Secret'', documents evidence of [[porphyria]] in [[Victoria, Princess Royal]]'s daughter [[Princess Charlotte of Prussia|Charlotte]], and her granddaughter, [[Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen|Feodora]].<ref name=rohl>[[John C.
