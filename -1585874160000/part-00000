{"title_page": "Magnetorotational instability", "text_new": "The '''magnetorotational instability (MRI)''' is a [[fluid]] [[instability]] that causes an [[accretion disk]] orbiting a massive central object to become [[turbulent]].  It arises when the [[angular velocity]] of a conducting fluid in a magnetic field decreases as the distance from the rotation center increases. It is also known as the '''Velikhov\u2013Chandrasekhar instability''' or '''Balbus\u2013Hawley instability''' in the literature, not to be confused with the electrothermal [[electrothermal instability|Velikhov instability]]. The MRI is of particular relevance in [[astrophysics]] where it is an important part of the dynamics in [[accretion disk]]s.\n\nGases or liquids containing mobile electrical charges are subject to the influence of a magnetic field. In addition to hydrodynamical forces such as pressure and gravity, an element of magnetized fluid also feels the [[Lorentz force]] <math>\\boldsymbol J\\times\\boldsymbol B\\ ,</math> where <math>\\boldsymbol J</math> is the current density and <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> is the magnetic field vector. If the fluid is in a state of differential rotation about a fixed origin, this Lorentz force can be surprisingly disruptive, even if the magnetic field is very weak. In particular,  if the angular velocity of rotation <math>\\Omega</math> decreases with radial distance <math>R\\ ,</math> the motion is unstable: a fluid element undergoing a small displacement from circular motion experiences a destabilizing force that increases at a rate which is itself proportional to the displacement. This process is known as the ''Magnetorotational Instability'', or  \"MRI\".\n\nIn astrophysical settings, differentially rotating systems are very common and magnetic fields are ubiquitous. In particular, thin disks of gas are often found around [[star formation|forming stars]] or in [[binary star]] systems, where they are known as accretion disks. Accretion disks are also commonly present in the centre of galaxies, and in some cases can be extremely luminous: [[quasars]], for example, are thought to originate from a gaseous disk surrounding a very massive [[black hole]]. Our modern understanding of the MRI arose from attempts to understand the behavior of accretion disks in the presence of magnetic fields; it is now understood that the MRI is likely to occur in a very wide variety of different systems.\n\n==History==\nThe MRI was first noticed in a non-astrophysical context by [[Evgeny Velikhov]] in 1959 when considering the stability of [[Couette flow]] of an ideal [[magnetohydrodynamics|hydromagnetic]] fluid.<ref name=\"V1959\">{{Citation\n | last=Velikhov | first=E.

Normally, such a force is restoring, a strongly stabilizing influence that would allow a type of magnetic wave to propagate.  If the fluid medium is not stationary but rotating, however, attractive forces can actually be destabilizing. The MRI is a consequence of this surprising behavior.\n\nConsider, for example, two masses, '''m<sub>i</sub>''' (\"inner\") and '''m<sub>o</sub>''' (\"outer\") connected by a spring under tension, both masses in orbit around a central body, '''M<sub>c</sub>'''. In such a system, the angular velocity of circular orbits near the center is greater than the angular velocity of orbits farther from the center, but the angular momentum of the inner orbits is smaller than that of the outer orbits. If '''m<sub>i</sub>''' is allowed to orbit a little bit closer to the center than '''m<sub>o</sub>''', it will have a slightly higher angular velocity. The connecting spring will pull back on '''m<sub>i</sub>''', and drag '''m<sub>o</sub>''' forward. This means that '''m<sub>i</sub>''' experiences a retarding torque, loses angular momentum, and must fall inward to an orbit of smaller radius, corresponding to a smaller angular momentum. '''m<sub>o</sub>''', on the other hand, experiences a positive torque, acquires more angular momentum, and moves outward to a higher orbit. The spring stretches yet more, the torques become yet larger, and the motion is unstable! Because magnetic forces act like a spring under tension connecting fluid elements, the behavior of a magnetized fluid is almost exactly analogous to this simple mechanical system. This is the essence of the MRI .\n\n==A more detailed explanation==\n\nTo see this unstable behavior more quantitatively, consider the equations of motion for a fluid element mass in circular motion with an angular velocity <math>\\Omega\\ .</math>  In general <math>\\Omega</math> will be a function of the distance from the rotation axis <math>R\\ ,</math> and we assume that the orbital radius is <math>r=R_0\\ .</math>  The centripetal acceleration required to keep the mass in orbit is <math>-R\\Omega^2(R)\\ ,</math> the minus sign indicates a direction toward the center.  If this force is gravity from a point mass at the center, then the centripetal acceleration is simply <math>-GM/R^2,</math> where <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]] and <math>M</math> is the central mass.\nLet us now consider small departures from the circular motion of the orbiting mass element caused by some perturbing force.  We transform variables into a [[non-inertial reference frame|rotating frame]] moving with the orbiting mass element at angular velocity <math>\\Omega(R_0)=\\Omega_0\\ ,</math> with origin located at the unperturbed, orbiting location of the mass element. As usual when working in a rotating frame, we need to add to the equations of motion a [[Coriolis force]] <math>-2\\boldsymbol\\Omega_0\\times\\boldsymbol v</math> plus a centrifugal force <math>R\\Omega_0^2\\ .</math> The velocity <math>v</math> is the velocity as measured in the rotating frame. Furthermore, we restrict our attention to a small neighborhood near <math>R_0\\ ,</math> say <math>R_0+x\\ ,</math> with <math>x</math> much smaller than <math>R_0\\ .</math>  Then the sum of the centrifugal and centripetal forces is\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\nR[\\Omega_0^2 - \\Omega^2(R_0+x)] \\simeq -x R{d\\Omega^2\\over dR}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n  \nto linear order in <math>x\\ .</math>  With our <math>x</math> axis pointing radial outward from the unperturbed location of the fluid element and our <math>y</math> axis pointing in the direction of increasing azimuthal angle (the direction of the unperturbed orbit), the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> equations of motion for a small departure from a circular orbit <math>R=R_0</math> are:\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\ddot{x} - 2\\Omega_0 \\dot{y} = -x R{d\\Omega^2\\over dR} +f_x</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\ddot{y} + 2\\Omega_0 \\dot{x} =f_y</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nwhere <math>f_x</math> and <math>f_y</math> are the forces per unit mass in the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> directions, and a dot indicates a time derivative (i.e., <math>\\dot x</math> is the <math>x</math> velocity, <math>\\ddot x</math> is the <math>x</math> acceleration, etc.).  Provided that <math>f_x</math> and <math>f_y</math> are either 0 or linear in x and y, this is a system of coupled second-order [[linear differential equations]] that can be solved analytically.\nIn the absence of external forces, <math>f_x = 0</math> and <math>f_y = 0</math>, the equations of motion have solutions with the time dependence <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\ ,</math> where the angular frequency <math>\\omega</math> satisfies the equation\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\omega^2 = 4\\Omega_0^2 + R{d\\Omega^2\\over dR}\\equiv \\kappa^2</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\kappa^2</math> is known as the [[epicyclic frequency]].  In our solar system, for example, deviations from a sun-centered circular orbit that are familiar ellipses when viewed by an external viewer at rest, appear instead as small radial and azimuthal oscillations of the orbiting element when viewed by an observer moving with the undisturbed circular motion.\nThese oscillations trace out a small retrograde ellipse (i.e. rotating in the opposite sense of the large circular orbit), centered on the undisturbed orbital location of the mass element.\n\nThe epicyclic frequency may equivalently be written <math>(1/R^3)(dR^4\\Omega^2/dR)\\ ,</math> which shows that it is proportional to the radial derivative of the angular momentum per unit mass, or specific angular momentum.  The specific angular momentum must increase outward if stable epicyclic oscillations are to exist, otherwise displacements would grow exponentially, corresponding to instability.  This is a very general result known as the ''Rayleigh criterion'' (Chandrasekhar 1961) for stability. For orbits around a point mass, the specific angular momentum is proportional to <math>R^{1/2}\\ ,</math> so the Rayleigh criterion is well satisfied.\n\nConsider next the solutions to the equations of motion if the mass element is subjected to an external restoring force, <math>f_x=-Kx\\ ,</math> <math>f_y=-Ky</math> where <math>K</math> is an arbitrary constant (the \"spring constant\").  If we now seek solutions for the modal displacements in <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> with time dependence <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\ ,</math> we find a much more complex equation for <math>\\omega\\ :</math>\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\omega^4 - (2K+\\kappa^2)\\omega^2 +K(K+Rd\\Omega^2/dR) =0</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nEven though the spring exerts an attractive force, it may destabilize.  For example, if the spring constant <math>K</math> is sufficiently weak, the dominant balance will be between the final two terms on the left side of the equation.  Then, a decreasing outward angular velocity profile will produce negative values for <math>\\omega^2\\ ,</math> and both positive and negative imaginary values for <math>\\omega\\ .</math> The negative imaginary root results not in oscillations, but in exponential growth of very small displacements.  A weak spring therefore causes the type of instability described qualitatively at the end of the previous section.  A ''strong'' spring on the other hand, will produce oscillations, as one intuitively expects.\n\n==The spring-like nature of magnetic fields==\nTo understand the how the MRI works, we must first understand the conditions inside a perfectly conducting fluid in motion.  This is often a good approximation to astrophysical gases. In the presence of a magnetic field <math>\\boldsymbol B\\ ,</math> a moving conductor responds by trying to eliminate the Lorentz force on the free charges.  The magnetic force acts in such a way as to locally rearrange these charges to produce an internal electric field of <math>\\boldsymbol {E=-{v\\times B}}\\ .</math> In this way, the direct Lorentz force on the charges <math>\\boldsymbol {E+v\\times B}</math> vanishes. (Alternatively, the electric field in the local rest frame of the moving charges vanishes.) This induced electric field can now itself induce further changes in the magnetic field <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> according to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]],\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n- \\boldsymbol {\\nabla\\times E} = {\\partial\\boldsymbol B\\over\\partial t}\\quad {\\rm or}\\quad\\boldsymbol {\\nabla\\times (v\\times B)} = {\\partial\\boldsymbol B\\over\\partial t}</math>|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nAnother way to write this equation is that if in time <math>\\delta t</math> the fluid makes a displacement <math>\\boldsymbol \\xi = \\boldsymbol v\\delta t\\ ,</math> then the magnetic field changes by\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\delta \\boldsymbol B = \\boldsymbol {\\nabla\\times (\\xi \\times B)}</math>|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nThe equation of a magnetic field in a perfect conductor in motion has a special property: the combination of Faraday induction and zero Lorentz force makes the field lines behave as though they were painted, or \"frozen,\" into the fluid.  In particular, if <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> is initially nearly constant and <math>\\xi</math> is a [[divergence-free]] displacement, then our equation reduces to\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\delta \\boldsymbol B = \\boldsymbol {\\ {(B\\cdot\\nabla)\\xi}},</math>|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\nbecause of the [[vector calculus identity]] <math> \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{\\xi} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\mathbf{\\xi} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\mathbf{B} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\xi}) + (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{\\xi} - (\\mathbf{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{B} \\ . </math>\nOut of these 4 terms, <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0</math> is one of [[Maxwell's equations]].  By the divergence-free assumption, <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\xi} = 0</math>.  <math>(\\mathbf{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{B} = 0 </math> because B is assumed to be nearly constant. Equation {{EquationNote|8}} shows that <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> changes only when there is a shearing displacement along the field line.\nTo understand the MRI, it is sufficient to consider the case in which <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> is uniform in vertical <math>z</math> direction, and <math>\\xi</math> varies as <math>e^{ikz}\\ .</math>  Then\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\delta \\boldsymbol B =ikB\\boldsymbol \\xi,</math>|{{EquationRef|9}}}}\n\nwhere it is understood that the real part of this equation expresses its physical content. (If <math>\\boldsymbol \\xi</math> is proportional to <math>\\cos(kz)\\ ,</math> for example, then <math>\\delta\\boldsymbol B</math> is proportional to <math>-\\sin(kz)\\ .</math>)\n\nA magnetic field exerts a force per unit volume on an electrically neutral, conducting fluid equal to <math>\\boldsymbol J\\times\\boldsymbol B\\ .</math> [[Maxwell's equations#Amp.C3.A8re.27s law with Maxwell.27s correction|Ampere's circuital law]] gives <math>\\mu_0\\boldsymbol {J=\\nabla\\times B}\\ ,</math> because Maxwell's correction is neglected in the MHD approximation.  The force per unit volume becomes\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\right)\\boldsymbol{(\\nabla\\times B)\\times B} = -\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_{0}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\right)\\boldsymbol{ (B\\cdot\\nabla) B}</math>|{{EquationRef|10}}}}\nwhere we have used the same vector calculus identity.  This equation is fully general, and makes no assumptions about the strength or direction of the magnetic field.\nThe first term on the right is analogous to a pressure gradient.  In our problem it may be neglected because it exerts no force in the plane of the disk, perpendicular to <math>z\\ .</math>  The second term acts like a magnetic tension force, analogous to a taut string.  For a small disturbance <math>\\delta\\boldsymbol B\\ ,</math> it exerts an acceleration given by force divided by mass, or equivalently, force per unit volume divided by mass per unit volume:\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}\\rho}\\right)\\boldsymbol{(B\\cdot\\nabla)\\delta B} =\n\\left(\\frac{ikB\\boldsymbol {\\delta B}}{\\mu_0\\rho}\\right)= -{k^2B^2\\over\\mu_0\\rho}\\boldsymbol (\\xi)</math>|{{EquationRef|11}}}}\n\nThus, a magnetic tension force gives rise to a return force which is directly proportional to the displacement.  This means that the oscillation frequency <math>\\omega</math> for small displacements in the plane of rotation of a disk with a uniform magnetic field in the vertical direction satisfies an equation (\"dispersion relation\") exactly analogous to equation {{EquationNote|5}}, with the \"spring constant\" <math>K={k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho}\\ :</math>\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\omega^4 - [2(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)+\\kappa^2]\\omega^2 +(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)\n[(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)+Rd\\Omega^2/dR] =0</math>|{{EquationRef|12}}}}\nAs before, if <math>d\\Omega^2/dR<0\\ ,</math> there is an exponentially growing root of this equation for wavenumbers <math>k</math> satisfying <math>(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)< - Rd\\Omega^2/dR\\ .</math>\nThis corresponds to the MRI.  \nNotice that the magnetic field appears in equation {{EquationNote|12}} only as the product <math>kB\\ .</math> Thus, even if <math>B</math> is very small, for very large wavenumbers <math>k</math> this magnetic tension can be important.  This is why the MRI is so sensitive to even very weak magnetic fields: their effect is amplified by multiplication by <math>k\\ .</math>  Moreover, it can be shown that MRI is present regardless of the magnetic field geometry, as long as the field is not too strong.\n\nIn astrophysics, one is generally interested in the case for which the disk is supported by rotation against the gravitational attraction of a central mass.  A balance between the Newtonian gravitational force and the radial centripetal force immediately gives\n{{NumBlk|::|<math>\n\\Omega^2 = {GM\\over R^3}</math>|{{EquationRef|13}}}}\n \nwhere <math>G</math> is the Newtonian gravitational constant, <math>M</math> is the central mass, and <math>R</math> is radial location in the disk. Since <math>Rd\\Omega^2/dR=-3\\Omega^2<0\\ ,</math> this so-called ''Keplerian disk'' is unstable to the MRI .  Without a weak magnetic field, the flow would be stable.\n\nFor a Keplerian disk, the maximum growth rate is <math>\\gamma=3\\Omega/4\\ ,</math> which occurs at a wavenumber satisfying <math>(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)=15\\Omega^2/16\\ .</math>\n<math>\\gamma</math> is very rapid, corresponding to an amplification factor of more than 100 per rotation period.\nThe nonlinear development of the MRI into fully developed turbulence may be followed via large scale numerical computation.\n\n==Applications and laboratory experiments==\nInterest in the MRI is based on the fact that it appears to give an explanation for the origin of turbulent flow in astrophysical accretion disks  (Balbus and Hawley, 1991).\nA promising model for the compact, intense X-ray sources discovered in the 1960s was that of a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]] drawing in (\u201caccreting\u201d) gas from its surroundings (Prendergast and Burbidge, 1968). Such gas always accretes with a finite amount of angular momentum relative to the central object, and so it must first form a rotating disk \u2014 it cannot accrete directly onto the object without first losing its angular momentum. But how an element of gaseous fluid managed to lose its angular momentum and spiral onto the central object was not at all obvious.\n\nOne explanation involved shear-driven turbulence  (Shakura and Sunyaev, 1973). There would be significant shear in an accretion disk  (gas closer to the centre rotates more rapidly than outer disk regions), and shear layers often break down into turbulent flow. The presence of shear-generated turbulence, in turn, produces the powerful torques needed to transport angular momentum from one (inner) fluid element to another (farther out).\n\nThe breakdown of shear layers into turbulence is routinely observed in flows with velocity gradients, but without systematic rotation. This is an important point, because rotation produces strongly stabilizing Coriolis forces, and this is precisely what occurs in accretion disks . As can be seen in equation {{EquationNote|5}}, the K = 0 limit produces Coriolis-stabilized oscillations, not exponential growth. These oscillations are present under much more general conditions as well: a recent laboratory experiment (Ji et al., 2006) has shown stability of the flow profile expected in accretion disks under conditions in which otherwise troublesome dissipation effects are (by a standard measure known as the Reynolds number) well below one part in a million. All of this changes, however, are when even a very weak magnetic field is present. The MRI produces torques that are not stabilized by Coriolis forces. Large scale numerical simulations of the MRI indicate that the rotational disk flow breaks down into turbulence  (Hawley et al., 1995), with strongly enhanced angular momentum transport properties. This is just what is required for the accretion disk model to work. The formation of stars (Stone et al., 2000), the production of X-rays in neutron star and black hole systems (Blaes, 2004), and the creation of active galactic nuclei  (Krolik, 1999) and gamma ray bursts  (Wheeler, 2004) are all thought to involve the development of the MRI at some level.\n\nThus far, we have focused rather exclusively on the dynamical breakdown of laminar flow into turbulence triggered by a weak magnetic field, but it is also the case that the resulting highly agitated flow can act back on this same magnetic field. Embedded magnetic field lines are stretched by the turbulent flow, and it is possible that systematic field amplification could result. The process by which fluid motions are converted to magnetic field energy is known as a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] (Moffatt, 1978); the two best studied examples are the Earth's liquid outer core and the layers close to the surface of the Sun. Dynamo activity in these regions is thought to be responsible for maintaining the terrestrial and solar magnetic fields. In both of these cases thermal [[convection]] is likely to be the primary energy source, though in the case of the Sun differential rotation may also play an important role. Whether the MRI is an efficient dynamo process in accretion disks is currently an area of active research (Fromang and Papaloizou, 2007).\n\nThere may also be applications of the MRI outside of the classical accretion disk venue. Internal rotation in stars (Ogilvie, 2007), and even planetary dynamos (Petitdemange et al., 2008) may, under some circumstances, be vulnerable to the MRI in combination with convective instabilities. These studies are also ongoing.\n\nFinally, the MRI can, in principle, be studied in the laboratory (Ji et al., 2001), though these experiments are very difficult to implement. A typical set-up involves either concentric spherical shells or coaxial cylindrical shells. Between (and confined by) the shells, there is a conducting liquid metal such as sodium or gallium. The inner and outer shells are set in rotation at different rates, and viscous torques compel the trapped liquid metal to differentially rotate. The experiment then investigates whether the differential rotation profile is stable or not in the presence of an applied magnetic field.\n\nA claimed detection of the MRI in a spherical shell experiment (Sisan et al., 2004), in which the underlying state was itself turbulent, awaits confirmation at the time of this writing (2009). A magnetic instability that bears some similarity to the MRI can be excited if both vertical and azimuthal magnetic fields are present in the undisturbed state (Hollerbach and R\u00fcdiger, 2005). This is sometimes referred to as the ''helical-MRI,'' (Liu et al., 2006) though its precise relation to the MRI described above has yet to be fully elucidated. Because it is less sensitive to stabilizing ohmic resistance than is the classical MRI, this helical magnetic instability is easier to excite in the laboratory, and there are indications that it may have been found (Stefani et al., 2006). The detection of the classical MRI in a hydrodynamically quiescent background state has yet to be achieved in the laboratory, however. \n\nThe spring-mass analogue of the standard MRI has been demonstrated in rotating Taylor\u2013Couette / Keplerian-like flow [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-018-0103-7 (Hung et al. 2019)]. \n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{cite journal | last=Acheson | first=D J | last2=Hide | first2=R | title=Hydromagnetics of rotating fluids | journal=Reports on Progress in Physics | publisher=IOP Publishing | volume=36 | issue=2 | date=1973-02-01 | issn=0034-4885 | doi=10.1088/0034-4885/36/2/002 | pages=159\u2013221}}\n* {{cite journal | last=Acheson | first=D.

It arises when the [[angular velocity]] of a conducting fluid in a magnetic field decreases as the distance from the rotation center increases. It is also known as the '''Velikhov\u2013Chandrasekhar instability''' or '''Balbus\u2013Hawley instability''' in the literature, not to be confused with the electrothermal [[electrothermal instability|Velikhov instability]]. The MRI is of particular relevance in [[astrophysics]] where it is an important part of the dynamics in [[accretion disk]]s.\n\nGases or liquids containing mobile electrical charges are subject to the influence of a magnetic field. In addition to hydrodynamical forces such as pressure and gravity, an element of magnetized fluid also feels the [[Lorentz force]] <math>\\boldsymbol J\\times\\boldsymbol B\\ ,</math> where <math>\\boldsymbol J</math> is the current density and <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> is the magnetic field vector. If the fluid is in a state of differential rotation about a fixed origin, this Lorentz force can be surprisingly disruptive, even if the magnetic field is very weak. In particular,  if the angular velocity of rotation <math>\\Omega</math> decreases with radial distance <math>R\\ ,</math> the motion is unstable: a fluid element undergoing a small displacement from circular motion experiences a destabilizing force that increases at a rate which is itself proportional to the displacement. This process is known as the ''Magnetorotational Instability'', or  \"MRI\".\n\nIn astrophysical settings, differentially rotating systems are very common and magnetic fields are ubiquitous. In particular, thin disks of gas are often found around [[star formation|forming stars]] or in [[binary star]] systems, where they are known as accretion disks. Accretion disks are also commonly present in the centre of galaxies, and in some cases can be extremely luminous: [[quasars]], for example, are thought to originate from a gaseous disk surrounding a very massive [[black hole]]. Our modern understanding of the MRI arose from attempts to understand the behavior of accretion disks in the presence of magnetic fields; it is now understood that the MRI is likely to occur in a very wide variety of different systems.\n\n==History==\nThe MRI was first noticed in a non-astrophysical context by [[Evgeny Velikhov]] in 1959 when considering the stability of [[Couette flow]] of an ideal [[magnetohydrodynamics|hydromagnetic]] fluid.<ref name=\"V1959\">{{Citation\n | last=Velikhov | first=E.

Normally, such a force is restoring, a strongly stabilizing influence that would allow a type of magnetic wave to propagate.  If the fluid medium is not stationary but rotating, however, attractive forces can actually be destabilizing. The MRI is a consequence of this surprising behavior.\n\nConsider, for example, two masses, '''m<sub>i</sub>''' (\"inner\") and '''m<sub>o</sub>''' (\"outer\") connected by a spring under tension, both masses in orbit around a central body, '''M<sub>c</sub>'''. In such a system, the angular velocity of circular orbits near the center is greater than the angular velocity of orbits farther from the center, but the angular momentum of the inner orbits is smaller than that of the outer orbits. If '''m<sub>i</sub>''' is allowed to orbit a little bit closer to the center than '''m<sub>o</sub>''', it will have a slightly higher angular velocity. The connecting spring will pull back on '''m<sub>i</sub>''', and drag '''m<sub>o</sub>''' forward. This means that '''m<sub>i</sub>''' experiences a retarding torque, loses angular momentum, and must fall inward to an orbit of smaller radius, corresponding to a smaller angular momentum. '''m<sub>o</sub>''', on the other hand, experiences a positive torque, acquires more angular momentum, and moves outward to a higher orbit. The spring stretches yet more, the torques become yet larger, and the motion is unstable! Because magnetic forces act like a spring under tension connecting fluid elements, the behavior of a magnetized fluid is almost exactly analogous to this simple mechanical system. This is the essence of the MRI .\n\n==A more detailed explanation==\n\nTo see this unstable behavior more quantitatively, consider the equations of motion for a fluid element mass in circular motion with an angular velocity <math>\\Omega\\ .</math>  In general <math>\\Omega</math> will be a function of the distance from the rotation axis <math>R\\ ,</math> and we assume that the orbital radius is <math>r=R_0\\ .</math>  The centripetal acceleration required to keep the mass in orbit is <math>-R\\Omega^2(R)\\ ,</math> the minus sign indicates a direction toward the center.  If this force is gravity from a point mass at the center, then the centripetal acceleration is simply <math>-GM/R^2,</math> where <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]] and <math>M</math> is the central mass.\nLet us now consider small departures from the circular motion of the orbiting mass element caused by some perturbing force.  We transform variables into a [[non-inertial reference frame|rotating frame]] moving with the orbiting mass element at angular velocity <math>\\Omega(R_0)=\\Omega_0\\ ,</math> with origin located at the unperturbed, orbiting location of the mass element. As usual when working in a rotating frame, we need to add to the equations of motion a [[Coriolis force]] <math>-2\\boldsymbol\\Omega_0\\times\\boldsymbol v</math> plus a centrifugal force <math>R\\Omega_0^2\\ .</math> The velocity <math>v</math> is the velocity as measured in the rotating frame. Furthermore, we restrict our attention to a small neighborhood near <math>R_0\\ ,</math> say <math>R_0+x\\ ,</math> with <math>x</math> much smaller than <math>R_0\\ .</math>  Then the sum of the centrifugal and centripetal forces is\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\nR[\\Omega_0^2 - \\Omega^2(R_0+x)] \\simeq -x R{d\\Omega^2\\over dR}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n  \nto linear order in <math>x\\ .</math>  With our <math>x</math> axis pointing radial outward from the unperturbed location of the fluid element and our <math>y</math> axis pointing in the direction of increasing azimuthal angle (the direction of the unperturbed orbit), the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> equations of motion for a small departure from a circular orbit <math>R=R_0</math> are:\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\ddot{x} - 2\\Omega_0 \\dot{y} = -x R{d\\Omega^2\\over dR} +f_x</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\ddot{y} + 2\\Omega_0 \\dot{x} =f_y</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nwhere <math>f_x</math> and <math>f_y</math> are the forces per unit mass in the <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> directions, and a dot indicates a time derivative (i.e., <math>\\dot x</math> is the <math>x</math> velocity, <math>\\ddot x</math> is the <math>x</math> acceleration, etc.).  Provided that <math>f_x</math> and <math>f_y</math> are either 0 or linear in x and y, this is a system of coupled second-order [[linear differential equations]] that can be solved analytically.\nIn the absence of external forces, <math>f_x = 0</math> and <math>f_y = 0</math>, the equations of motion have solutions with the time dependence <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\ ,</math> where the angular frequency <math>\\omega</math> satisfies the equation\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\omega^2 = 4\\Omega_0^2 + R{d\\Omega^2\\over dR}\\equiv \\kappa^2</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\kappa^2</math> is known as the [[epicyclic frequency]].  In our solar system, for example, deviations from a sun-centered circular orbit that are familiar ellipses when viewed by an external viewer at rest, appear instead as small radial and azimuthal oscillations of the orbiting element when viewed by an observer moving with the undisturbed circular motion.\nThese oscillations trace out a small retrograde ellipse (i.e. rotating in the opposite sense of the large circular orbit), centered on the undisturbed orbital location of the mass element.\n\nThe epicyclic frequency may equivalently be written <math>(1/R^3)(dR^4\\Omega^2/dR)\\ ,</math> which shows that it is proportional to the radial derivative of the angular momentum per unit mass, or specific angular momentum.  The specific angular momentum must increase outward if stable epicyclic oscillations are to exist, otherwise displacements would grow exponentially, corresponding to instability.  This is a very general result known as the ''Rayleigh criterion'' (Chandrasekhar 1961) for stability. For orbits around a point mass, the specific angular momentum is proportional to <math>R^{1/2}\\ ,</math> so the Rayleigh criterion is well satisfied.\n\nConsider next the solutions to the equations of motion if the mass element is subjected to an external restoring force, <math>f_x=-Kx\\ ,</math> <math>f_y=-Ky</math> where <math>K</math> is an arbitrary constant (the \"spring constant\").  If we now seek solutions for the modal displacements in <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> with time dependence <math>e^{i\\omega t}\\ ,</math> we find a much more complex equation for <math>\\omega\\ :</math>\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\omega^4 - (2K+\\kappa^2)\\omega^2 +K(K+Rd\\Omega^2/dR) =0</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nEven though the spring exerts an attractive force, it may destabilize.  For example, if the spring constant <math>K</math> is sufficiently weak, the dominant balance will be between the final two terms on the left side of the equation.  Then, a decreasing outward angular velocity profile will produce negative values for <math>\\omega^2\\ ,</math> and both positive and negative imaginary values for <math>\\omega\\ .</math> The negative imaginary root results not in oscillations, but in exponential growth of very small displacements.  A weak spring therefore causes the type of instability described qualitatively at the end of the previous section.  A ''strong'' spring on the other hand, will produce oscillations, as one intuitively expects.\n\n==The spring-like nature of magnetic fields==\nTo understand the how the MRI works, we must first understand the conditions inside a perfectly conducting fluid in motion.  This is often a good approximation to astrophysical gases. In the presence of a magnetic field <math>\\boldsymbol B\\ ,</math> a moving conductor responds by trying to eliminate the Lorentz force on the free charges.  The magnetic force acts in such a way as to locally rearrange these charges to produce an internal electric field of <math>\\boldsymbol {E=-{v\\times B}}\\ .</math> In this way, the direct Lorentz force on the charges <math>\\boldsymbol {E+v\\times B}</math> vanishes. (Alternatively, the electric field in the local rest frame of the moving charges vanishes.) This induced electric field can now itself induce further changes in the magnetic field <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> according to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]],\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n- \\boldsymbol {\\nabla\\times E} = {\\partial\\boldsymbol B\\over\\partial t}\\quad {\\rm or}\\quad\\boldsymbol {\\nabla\\times (v\\times B)} = {\\partial\\boldsymbol B\\over\\partial t}</math>|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nAnother way to write this equation is that if in time <math>\\delta t</math> the fluid makes a displacement <math>\\boldsymbol \\xi = \\boldsymbol v\\delta t\\ ,</math> then the magnetic field changes by\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\delta \\boldsymbol B = \\boldsymbol {\\nabla\\times (\\xi \\times B)}</math>|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nThe equation of a magnetic field in a perfect conductor in motion has a special property: the combination of Faraday induction and zero Lorentz force makes the field lines behave as though they were painted, or \"frozen,\" into the fluid.  In particular, if <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> is initially nearly constant and <math>\\xi</math> is a [[divergence-free]] displacement, then our equation reduces to\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\delta \\boldsymbol B = \\boldsymbol {\\ {(B\\cdot\\nabla)\\xi}},</math>|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\nbecause of the [[vector calculus identity]] <math> \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{\\xi} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\mathbf{\\xi} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\mathbf{B} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\xi}) + (\\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{\\xi} - (\\mathbf{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{B} \\ . </math>\nOut of these 4 terms, <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0</math> is one of [[Maxwell's equations]].  By the divergence-free assumption, <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{\\xi} = 0</math>.  <math>(\\mathbf{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{B} = 0 </math> because B is assumed to be nearly constant. Equation {{EquationNote|8}} shows that <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> changes only when there is a shearing displacement along the field line.\nTo understand the MRI, it is sufficient to consider the case in which <math>\\boldsymbol B</math> is uniform in vertical <math>z</math> direction, and <math>\\xi</math> varies as <math>e^{ikz}\\ .</math>  Then\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\delta \\boldsymbol B =ikB\\boldsymbol \\xi,</math>|{{EquationRef|9}}}}\n\nwhere it is understood that the real part of this equation expresses its physical content. (If <math>\\boldsymbol \\xi</math> is proportional to <math>\\cos(kz)\\ ,</math> for example, then <math>\\delta\\boldsymbol B</math> is proportional to <math>-\\sin(kz)\\ .</math>)\n\nA magnetic field exerts a force per unit volume on an electrically neutral, conducting fluid equal to <math>\\boldsymbol J\\times\\boldsymbol B\\ .</math> [[Maxwell's equations#Amp.C3.A8re.27s law with Maxwell.27s correction|Ampere's circuital law]] gives <math>\\mu_0\\boldsymbol {J=\\nabla\\times B}\\ ,</math> because Maxwell's correction is neglected in the MHD approximation.  The force per unit volume becomes\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\right)\\boldsymbol{(\\nabla\\times B)\\times B} = -\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_{0}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\right)\\boldsymbol{ (B\\cdot\\nabla) B}</math>|{{EquationRef|10}}}}\nwhere we have used the same vector calculus identity.  This equation is fully general, and makes no assumptions about the strength or direction of the magnetic field.\nThe first term on the right is analogous to a pressure gradient.  In our problem it may be neglected because it exerts no force in the plane of the disk, perpendicular to <math>z\\ .</math>  The second term acts like a magnetic tension force, analogous to a taut string.  For a small disturbance <math>\\delta\\boldsymbol B\\ ,</math> it exerts an acceleration given by force divided by mass, or equivalently, force per unit volume divided by mass per unit volume:\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}\\rho}\\right)\\boldsymbol{(B\\cdot\\nabla)\\delta B} =\n\\left(\\frac{ikB\\boldsymbol {\\delta B}}{\\mu_0\\rho}\\right)= -{k^2B^2\\over\\mu_0\\rho}\\boldsymbol (\\xi)</math>|{{EquationRef|11}}}}\n\nThus, a magnetic tension force gives rise to a return force which is directly proportional to the displacement.  This means that the oscillation frequency <math>\\omega</math> for small displacements in the plane of rotation of a disk with a uniform magnetic field in the vertical direction satisfies an equation (\"dispersion relation\") exactly analogous to equation {{EquationNote|5}}, with the \"spring constant\" <math>K={k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho}\\ :</math>\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\omega^4 - [2(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)+\\kappa^2]\\omega^2 +(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)\n[(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)+Rd\\Omega^2/dR] =0</math>|{{EquationRef|12}}}}\nAs before, if <math>d\\Omega^2/dR<0\\ ,</math> there is an exponentially growing root of this equation for wavenumbers <math>k</math> satisfying <math>(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)< - Rd\\Omega^2/dR\\ .</math>\nThis corresponds to the MRI.  \nNotice that the magnetic field appears in equation {{EquationNote|12}} only as the product <math>kB\\ .</math> Thus, even if <math>B</math> is very small, for very large wavenumbers <math>k</math> this magnetic tension can be important.  This is why the MRI is so sensitive to even very weak magnetic fields: their effect is amplified by multiplication by <math>k\\ .</math>  Moreover, it can be shown that MRI is present regardless of the magnetic field geometry, as long as the field is not too strong.\n\nIn astrophysics, one is generally interested in the case for which the disk is supported by rotation against the gravitational attraction of a central mass.  A balance between the Newtonian gravitational force and the radial centripetal force immediately gives\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n\\Omega^2 = {GM\\over R^3}</math>|{{EquationRef|13}}}}\n \nwhere <math>G</math> is the Newtonian gravitational constant, <math>M</math> is the central mass, and <math>R</math> is radial location in the disk. Since <math>Rd\\Omega^2/dR=-3\\Omega^2<0\\ ,</math> this so-called ''Keplerian disk'' is unstable to the MRI .  Without a weak magnetic field, the flow would be stable.\n\nFor a Keplerian disk, the maximum growth rate is <math>\\gamma=3\\Omega/4\\ ,</math> which occurs at a wavenumber satisfying <math>(k^2B^2/\\mu_0\\rho)=15\\Omega^2/16\\ .</math>\n<math>\\gamma</math> is very rapid, corresponding to an amplification factor of more than 100 per rotation period.\nThe nonlinear development of the MRI into fully developed turbulence may be followed via large scale numerical computation.\n\n==Applications and laboratory experiments==\nInterest in the MRI is based on the fact that it appears to give an explanation for the origin of turbulent flow in astrophysical accretion disks  (Balbus and Hawley, 1991).\nA promising model for the compact, intense X-ray sources discovered in the 1960s was that of a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]] drawing in (\u201caccreting\u201d) gas from its surroundings (Prendergast and Burbidge, 1968). Such gas always accretes with a finite amount of angular momentum relative to the central object, and so it must first form a rotating disk \u2014 it cannot accrete directly onto the object without first losing its angular momentum. But how an element of gaseous fluid managed to lose its angular momentum and spiral onto the central object was not at all obvious.\n\nOne explanation involved shear-driven turbulence  (Shakura and Sunyaev, 1973). There would be significant shear in an accretion disk  (gas closer to the centre rotates more rapidly than outer disk regions), and shear layers often break down into turbulent flow. The presence of shear-generated turbulence, in turn, produces the powerful torques needed to transport angular momentum from one (inner) fluid element to another (farther out).\n\nThe breakdown of shear layers into turbulence is routinely observed in flows with velocity gradients, but without systematic rotation. This is an important point, because rotation produces strongly stabilizing Coriolis forces, and this is precisely what occurs in accretion disks . As can be seen in equation {{EquationNote|5}}, the K = 0 limit produces Coriolis-stabilized oscillations, not exponential growth. These oscillations are present under much more general conditions as well: a recent laboratory experiment (Ji et al., 2006) has shown stability of the flow profile expected in accretion disks under conditions in which otherwise troublesome dissipation effects are (by a standard measure known as the Reynolds number) well below one part in a million. All of this changes, however, are when even a very weak magnetic field is present. The MRI produces torques that are not stabilized by Coriolis forces. Large scale numerical simulations of the MRI indicate that the rotational disk flow breaks down into turbulence  (Hawley et al., 1995), with strongly enhanced angular momentum transport properties. This is just what is required for the accretion disk model to work. The formation of stars (Stone et al., 2000), the production of X-rays in neutron star and black hole systems (Blaes, 2004), and the creation of active galactic nuclei  (Krolik, 1999) and gamma ray bursts  (Wheeler, 2004) are all thought to involve the development of the MRI at some level.\n\nThus far, we have focused rather exclusively on the dynamical breakdown of laminar flow into turbulence triggered by a weak magnetic field, but it is also the case that the resulting highly agitated flow can act back on this same magnetic field. Embedded magnetic field lines are stretched by the turbulent flow, and it is possible that systematic field amplification could result. The process by which fluid motions are converted to magnetic field energy is known as a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] (Moffatt, 1978); the two best studied examples are the Earth's liquid outer core and the layers close to the surface of the Sun. Dynamo activity in these regions is thought to be responsible for maintaining the terrestrial and solar magnetic fields. In both of these cases thermal [[convection]] is likely to be the primary energy source, though in the case of the Sun differential rotation may also play an important role. Whether the MRI is an efficient dynamo process in accretion disks is currently an area of active research (Fromang and Papaloizou, 2007).\n\nThere may also be applications of the MRI outside of the classical accretion disk venue. Internal rotation in stars (Ogilvie, 2007), and even planetary dynamos (Petitdemange et al., 2008) may, under some circumstances, be vulnerable to the MRI in combination with convective instabilities. These studies are also ongoing.\n\nFinally, the MRI can, in principle, be studied in the laboratory (Ji et al., 2001), though these experiments are very difficult to implement. A typical set-up involves either concentric spherical shells or coaxial cylindrical shells. Between (and confined by) the shells, there is a conducting liquid metal such as sodium or gallium. The inner and outer shells are set in rotation at different rates, and viscous torques compel the trapped liquid metal to differentially rotate. The experiment then investigates whether the differential rotation profile is stable or not in the presence of an applied magnetic field.\n\nA claimed detection of the MRI in a spherical shell experiment (Sisan et al., 2004), in which the underlying state was itself turbulent, awaits confirmation at the time of this writing (2009). A magnetic instability that bears some similarity to the MRI can be excited if both vertical and azimuthal magnetic fields are present in the undisturbed state (Hollerbach and R\u00fcdiger, 2005). This is sometimes referred to as the ''helical-MRI,'' (Liu et al., 2006) though its precise relation to the MRI described above has yet to be fully elucidated. Because it is less sensitive to stabilizing ohmic resistance than is the classical MRI, this helical magnetic instability is easier to excite in the laboratory, and there are indications that it may have been found (Stefani et al., 2006). The detection of the classical MRI in a hydrodynamically quiescent background state has yet to be achieved in the laboratory, however. \n\nThe spring-mass analogue of the standard MRI has been demonstrated in rotating Taylor\u2013Couette / Keplerian-like flow [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-018-0103-7 (Hung et al. 2019)]. \n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{cite journal | last=Acheson | first=D J | last2=Hide | first2=R | title=Hydromagnetics of rotating fluids | journal=Reports on Progress in Physics | publisher=IOP Publishing | volume=36 | issue=2 | date=1973-02-01 | issn=0034-4885 | doi=10.1088/0034-4885/36/2/002 | pages=159\u2013221}}\n* {{cite journal | last=Acheson | first=D.

{"title_page": "Australian Chinese cuisine", "text_new": "'''Australian Chinese cuisine''' is a style of cooking developed by [[Chinese Australians|Australians of Chinese descent]], who adapted dishes to satisfy local Anglo-Celtic tastes. Its roots can be traced to indentured Chinese who were brought to work as cooks in country pubs and [[sheep station|sheep stations]].\n\nMigrant numbers exploded with the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] of the 19th century. By 1890, a third of all cooks were Chinese. Historians believe exemptions for Chinese chefs under the [[White Australia policy]] led to the eventual spread of Chinese restaurants across suburbs and country towns. \n\nMost early Chinese migrants were from [[Guangdong]] province, and so [[Cantonese cuisine]] became the chief influence, using locally available vegetables and more meat than was usual in traditional recipes. Later Chinese immigration, as well as increasingly adventurous domestic palates, have led to restaurants with more authentic dishes from a wider selection of provinces. Chinese food is Australia's favourite foreign cuisine.\n\n== History ==\nNot until the Australian Gold Rushes did many Chinese immigrants move to the country. The gold rushes drew thousands of Chinese people, mostly from villages in Southern China - especially [[Pearl River Delta|the Pearl River delta]].{{fact|date=November 2018}} In 1855, there were 11,493 Chinese arrivals in [[Melbourne|Melbourne, Victoria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Diggers From China: The Story of Chinese on the Goldfields.|last=Gittins|first=Jean|publisher=Melbourne : Quartet Books|year=1981|isbn=0908128169|location=Victoria|pages=128}}</ref> \n\nAs gold was rare, and mining always a dangerous job, Chinese people started to do different jobs to earn a living. Many chose to open small grocery stores or fruit and vegetable-hawking businesses, enter the fishing and fish curing industry. or become market gardeners.

Therefore, Chinese cuisine in Australia from the beginning were usually hot, spicy and numbing ([[Sichuan cuisine]]); and/or sweet and sour ([[Cantonese cuisine|Guangdong cuisine]]).<ref>Cantonese Cuisine.

As a result, after the White Australia policy was revoked, many Chinese migrants brought seeds from China and started to grow their own vegetables at home to increase the variety in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=State of Queensland (Metro South Health) 2015|first=|date=|title=Food and cultural practices of the Chinese community in Australia \u2013 a community resource|url=https://metrosouth.health.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/content/heau-cultural-profile-chinese.pdf|journal=Queensland Government Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Since then, the Australian Chinese cuisine started to develop more authentically with an increasing utilisation of traditional ingredients.{{or-inline|date=November 2018}} Nowadays, Australia has welcomed and adapted to different Chinese cooking styles from different provinces including Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and others.{{or-inline|date=November 2018}} Nonetheless, there are still differences between the Chinese cuisine found in China and Australia.{{or-inline|date=November 2018}}\n\nChinese food has been named as Australia's favourite cuisine according to Roy Morgan Research.<ref>Morgan, R.

One of the reason for this is due to the conflicts between Australian and Chinese people. In order for these Chinese restaurants to survive, Chinese chefs were expected to provide food that would not directly compete with that of white establishments, but would still suit Western tastes. As a result, many Australian Chinese restaurants have adjusted their food to better adapt to the Australians' appetites. For instance, traditional cuisines of China considers vegetables as a main dish; while Westerners only treat vegetables as side dishes. To better suit the local diners, Chinese restaurants offer more meat options on the menus.<ref>The Little-Known History of Chinese Restaurants in Australia. (2016, March).

Their cooking methods usually favor steaming and braising the most. However, to better adapt to the Australian palates, deep-fried and saucy Asian dishes have also been included in the new menus. These includes sweet and sour pork, sticky lemon chicken and [[dim sim]]. Inspired by the authentic Chinese style of dishes, [[dim sum]], the dim sim or \u201cdimmy\u201d is developed by Chinese chef [[William Wing Young]] around 1945 in Melbourne. Dimsim is a dumpling with thick (crispy) skin filled with meat and is usually fried.<ref name=dimsimkwong>{{Cite news|url=https://mabelkwong.com/2013/03/14/asian-food-in-australia-not-authentic-but-still-delicious/|title=Asian Food In Australia: Not Authentic But Still Delicious|date=2013-03-14|work=Mabel Kwong|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}</ref> It is normally mistaken for [[dim sum]] - small bite-sized portions of [[food]] served in small baskets which are usually cooked by the [[Steaming|steaming method]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}\n\nAnother example showing the adaptation of the Chinese cuisine can be seen through how [[Matthew Chan (chef)|Matthew Chan]] has developed [[Peacock Gardens Restaurant]] into the symbol of Modern Australian Chinese cuisine. In an interview with [[News.com.au]], Matthew said that back in the 70's, Australian customers are not yet familiar with dishes such as \u201cchicken chop suey, san choy bow and beef and black bean\". It was Matthew Chan who has introduced these dishes into Australia with a few Western twists. For example, with 'san choy bow', understanding that Australian people were not familiar with [[Columbidae#As_food|pigeon meat]], Chan decided to change the main protein to pork and beef mince. Furthermore, many vegetables were also substituted: cabbage to celery; bamboo shoots to water chestnuts; and most notably how [[Broccoli|Western broccoli]] have been used more frequently instead of [[Gai lan|Chinese broccoli]] .<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/australias-chinese-food-rates-among-the-best-in-the-world-thanks-to-this-pioneer/news-story/dbc8b50b5fecc847f4a9afb496647180|title=Chan celebrates 42 years at Peacock Gardens|work=News.Com.Au|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, as the popularity of Chinese cuisine has been increasing steadily in Australia for the past century, unheard Chinese ingredients are now appearing in Australian kitchens more regularly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-21/humble-chinese-diner-mapped-by-food-historians/7187218|title=Story of Chinese food down under mapped by historians|date=2016-02-21|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-AU}}</ref> For instance, tofu - a dish that was not accepted in Australia has now been the main ingredient in many dishes served in the country. Tofu was discovered over 2000 years ago by the action of curdling soymilk and pressing those curds into blocks with different textures such as soft, firm and extra-firm. A well-known tofu dish that are normally served in Chinese restaurants around the country is [[Mapo doufu|Mapo Tofu]].\n\nHowever, on the other hand, some Australian Chinese dishes are actually inspired by Western cuisine, this includes the Wasabi Prawn. This dish was developed by Matthew Chan during a business trip to America \u201cI got the idea from the Hilton\u2019s San Francisco Grill where they had mustard on roast beef. I tried to do mustard steak but it didn\u2019t work, so I tried it with prawns.\u201d In this dish, the prawns are coated with the tangy and creamy English mustard and are served with a side of deep-fried spinach leaves sprinkled with sugar to balance the mustard's sharp and strong flavours.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn short, most Chinese restaurants in Australia are designed to be able to cater both Chinese and non-Chinese customers. That being said, there are many items on the menu such as chicken liver, ox tongue, pig uteri and other dishes that can 'frighten' the Western customers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/pig-heads-lamb-testicles-and-stirfried-cockroaches-top-sydney8217s-scariest-food-list/news-story/6a72a7183f87799dfd1734784a99dc26|title=Scariest Food in Sydney|last=Meryment|first=Elizabeth|date=31 August 2013|website=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, due to the growing population of Chinese people in Australia, there are more and more Australian Chinese restaurants that serve highly authentic tastes, and there is a wider variety of types of Chinese Restaurants. This has included a significant boom in [[Cha chaan teng|Hong Kong(/Macau) Style Cafes]], often serving mixed Cantonese-western dishes with HK-style coffee or tea. [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] restaurants have also significantly increased, especially in the major cities.\n\n==Restaurants==\n{{main|Chinese restaurants in Australia}}\nDue to such large popularity, Chinese restaurants can be found in most suburbs and cities of Australia. However, the most concentrated locations of Chinese restaurants in Australia are identified as [[Chinatown]]s. Here, the dishes are normally prepared to cater for recent Asian immigrants, tourists as well as Western people with a larger variety of cuisine; including [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]], [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]], [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]] and others. \n\nChinese restaurants can also be serving food at different price points; as well as serving both traditional and modern Chinese food. For instance, Chinese restaurants which are found in food-courts normally provide food for customers with shoestring budget. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/sydney/restaurants/the-best-cheap-eats-in-sydney|title=The best cheap eats in Sydney|work=Time Out Sydney|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}</ref> For instance, in [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]],[[Sydney]], inside Dixon House, there are many Chinese food stalls that serve affordable Chinese meals. Dixon House, opened in 1982, is one of the most well-known Chinatown food courts. According to Thang Ngo \"[Dixon House] is still the most Chinese of the Chinatown food courts\" <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://noodlies.com/2016/03/best-food-courts-chinatown-sydney/|title=Complete list of every Chinatown food court stall {{!}} noodlies - A Sydney food blog by Thang Ngo|date=2016-03-20|work=noodlies - A Sydney food blog by Thang Ngo|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}</ref> The place now boasts restaurants such as Oriental Dumpling King and Sizzling and Hot Pot Kitchen, where customers can find meals that range from AU$10 - AU$20. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn the other hand, Chinese restaurants can also be very expensive. The [[Golden Century Seafood Restaurant]], located in [[Chinatown, Sydney|Sydney Chinatown]], has become the symbol for Chinese luxurious dining. The restaurant was established in 1989 and is known for their 'from tank to plate' serving style. This serving style, according to presenter [[Gus Worland]], has provided an assurance for the freshness of the ingredients. Signature dishes such as ''Braised Lobster with Ginger and Shallot'' as well as ''Braised Whole Abalone with Oyster Sauce'' can cost the customers around AU$300. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dimmi.com.au/restaurant/golden-century/menu|title=Golden Century|last=Dimmi|website=Dimmi|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref> Moreover, the reason why The Golden Century Seafood Restaurant has become very well-known is that the place has been hosting royalty, politicians and celebrities. For instance, former United States president, [[George W. Bush]] has been spotted eating Peking Duck; or well-known celebrities such as [[Rihanna]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have also been seen to enjoy seafood at the restaurant. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodfood.com.au/golden-century-seafood-restaurant-haymarket/golden-century-seafood-restaurant-review-20180215-h0w5bb|title=Good times, every time, at Golden Century|last=Rigby|first=Myffy|website=Good Food|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref> \n\nAustralia also contains of authentic restaurants which serves traditional styles as well as restaurants that serves contemporary Chinese cuisine. Authentic Chinese cuisine can be found in [[Supper Inn Chinese Restaurant]]. Supper Inn was established in the 1980s; the restaurant is located in the central business district of Melbourne. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/melbourne/restaurants/supper-inn-chinese-restaurant|title=Supper Inn Chinese Restaurant {{!}} Restaurants in Melbourne, Melbourne|work=Time Out Melbourne|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}</ref>  The food served by Super Inn is described as classic Chinese/Cantonese food: \"It is such a simple comfort to eat here, [the restaurant] serves quality consistent Cantonese food.\" Super Inn's signature dishes include chicken [[congee]] and [[Suckling pig|BBQ Suckling Pig]]. These dishes have been around in China for thousands of years. Moreover, the restaurant is also famous for its late night food; the restaurant only decided to close at 2:30 AM - everyday.{{fact|date=November 2018}} \n\nOn the contrary, there are also restaurants that decided to combine the authentic tastes Chinese cuisine with other cuisines around the world to create its own version of contemporary Chinese food.

Its roots can be traced to indentured Chinese who were brought to work as cooks in country pubs and [[sheep station|sheep stations]].\n\nMigrant numbers exploded with the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] of the 19th century. By 1890, a third of all cooks were Chinese. Historians believe exemptions for Chinese chefs under the [[White Australia policy]] led to the eventual spread of Chinese restaurants across suburbs and country towns. \n\nMost early Chinese migrants were from [[Guangdong]] province, and so [[Cantonese cuisine]] became the chief influence, using locally available vegetables and more meat than was usual in traditional recipes. Later Chinese immigration, as well as increasingly adventurous domestic palates, have led to restaurants with more authentic dishes from a wider selection of provinces. Chinese food is Australia's favourite foreign cuisine.\n\n== History ==\nNot until the Australian Gold Rushes did many Chinese immigrants move to the country.

One of the reason for this is due to the conflicts between Australian and Chinese people. In order for these Chinese restaurants to survive, Chinese chefs were expected to provide food that would not directly compete with that of white establishments, but would still suit Western tastes. As a result, many Australian Chinese restaurants have adjusted their food to better adapt to the Australians' appetites. For instance, traditional cuisines of China considers vegetables as a main dish; while Westerners only treat vegetables as side dishes. To better suit the local diners, Chinese restaurants offer more meat options on the menus.<ref>The Little-Known History of Chinese Restaurants in Australia. (2016, March).

In an interview with [[News.com.au]], Matthew said that back in the 70's, Australian customers are not yet familiar with dishes such as \u201cchicken chop suey, san choy bow and beef and black bean\". It was Matthew Chan who has introduced these dishes into Australia with a few Western twists. For example, with 'san choy bow', understanding that Australian people were not familiar with [[Columbidae#As_food|pigeon meat]], Chan decided to change the main protein to pork and beef mince. Furthermore, many vegetables were also substituted: cabbage to celery; bamboo shoots to water chestnuts; and most notably how [[Broccoli|Western broccoli]] have been used more frequently instead of [[Gai lan|Chinese broccoli]] .<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/australias-chinese-food-rates-among-the-best-in-the-world-thanks-to-this-pioneer/news-story/dbc8b50b5fecc847f4a9afb496647180|title=Chan celebrates 42 years at Peacock Gardens|work=News.Com.Au|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, as the popularity of Chinese cuisine has been increasing steadily in Australia for the past century, unheard Chinese ingredients are now appearing in Australian kitchens more regularly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-21/humble-chinese-diner-mapped-by-food-historians/7187218|title=Story of Chinese food down under mapped by historians|date=2016-02-21|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-AU}}</ref> For instance, tofu - a dish that was not accepted in Australia has now been the main ingredient in many dishes served in the country. Tofu was discovered over 2000 years ago by the action of curdling soymilk and pressing those curds into blocks with different textures such as soft, firm and extra-firm. A well-known tofu dish that are normally served in Chinese restaurants around the country is [[Mapo doufu|Mapo Tofu]].\n\nHowever, on the other hand, some Australian Chinese dishes are actually inspired by Western cuisine, this includes the Wasabi Prawn. This dish was developed by Matthew Chan during a business trip to America \u201cI got the idea from the Hilton\u2019s San Francisco Grill where they had mustard on roast beef. I tried to do mustard steak but it didn\u2019t work, so I tried it with prawns.\u201d In this dish, the prawns are coated with the tangy and creamy English mustard and are served with a side of deep-fried spinach leaves sprinkled with sugar to balance the mustard's sharp and strong flavours.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn short, most Chinese restaurants in Australia are designed to be able to cater both Chinese and non-Chinese customers. That being said, there are many items on the menu such as chicken liver, ox tongue, pig uteri and other dishes that can 'frighten' the Western customers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/pig-heads-lamb-testicles-and-stirfried-cockroaches-top-sydney8217s-scariest-food-list/news-story/6a72a7183f87799dfd1734784a99dc26|title=Scariest Food in Sydney|last=Meryment|first=Elizabeth|date=31 August 2013|website=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, due to the growing population of Chinese people in Australia, there are more and more Australian Chinese restaurants that serve highly authentic tastes, and there is a wider variety of types of Chinese Restaurants. This has included a significant boom in [[Cha chaan teng|Hong Kong(/Macau) Style Cafes]], often serving mixed Cantonese-western dishes with HK-style coffee or tea. [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] restaurants have also significantly increased, especially in the major cities.\n\n==Restaurants==\n{{main|Chinese restaurants in Australia}}\nDue to such large popularity, Chinese restaurants can be found in most suburbs and cities of Australia. However, the most concentrated locations of Chinese restaurants in Australia are identifies as [[Chinatown]]s.

The [[Golden Century Seafood Restaurant]], located in [[Chinatown, Sydney|Sydney Chinatown]], has become the symbol for Chinese luxurious dining. The restaurant was established in 1989 and is known for their 'from tank to plate' serving style. This serving style, according to presenter [[Gus Worland]], has provided an assurance for the freshness of the ingredients. Signature dishes such as ''Braised Lobster with Ginger and Shallot'' as well as ''Braised Whole Abalone with Oyster Sauce'' can cost the customers around AU$300. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dimmi.com.au/restaurant/golden-century/menu|title=Golden Century|last=Dimmi|website=Dimmi|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref> Moreover, the reason why The Golden Century Seafood Restaurant has become very well-known is that the place has been hosting royalty, politicians and celebrities. For instance, former United States president, [[George W.

As [[Ann Demeulemeester]] said of it, \"Black is poetic. How do you imagine a poet? In a bright yellow jacket? Probably not.\" In the early 19th century, black was adopted by the [[Romantics]] such as [[Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], and [[Keats]], due ton its melancholic aura. As the [[Victorian era]] began, black transitions from a color of art to one of grief and mourning \u2013 widows were expected to wear black for at least four years \u2013 and also for service livery, as the uniform for [[maid]]s.\n\nIn 1926 [[Gabrielle Chanel|Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel]] published a picture of a short, simple black dress in American ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. It was calf-length, straight and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. ''Vogue'' called it \"Chanel's Ford\".

[[Hollywood]]'s influence on fashion helped the little black dress's popularity, but for more practical reasons: as [[Technicolor]] films became more common, filmmakers relied on little black dresses because other colors looked distorted on screen and botched the coloring process. During [[World War II]], the style continued in part due to widespread rationing of textiles, and in part as a common uniform (accessorized for businesswear) for civilian women entering the workforce.\n[[File:Black evening dress by Patou.jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|Black evening dress by Jean Patou]]\nThe rise of [[The New Look (style)|Dior's \"New Look\"]] in the post-war era and the sexual conservatism of the 1950s returned the little black dress to its roots as a uniform and a symbol of the dangerous woman. Hollywood [[femme fatale]]s and [[fallen women]] characters were portrayed often in black halter-style dresses in contrast to the more conservative dresses of housewives or more wholesome Hollywood stars. Synthetic fibres made popular in the 1940s and 1950s broadened the availability and affordability of many designs.\n\nThe generation gap of the 1960s created a dichotomy in the design of the little black dress. The younger \"[[mod (subculture)|mod]]\" generation preferred, in general, a miniskirt on their versions of the dress and designers catering to the [[youth culture]] continued to push the envelope - shortening the skirt even more, creating cutouts or slits in the skirt or bodice of the dress, using sheer fabrics such as [[netting]] or [[Tulle (netting)|tulle]]. Many women aspired to simple black sheath dresses similar to the [[Black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn|black Givenchy dress]] worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.\n\nThe popularity of casual fabrics, especially knits, for dress and business wear during the 1980s brought the little black dress back into vogue. Coupled with the fitness craze, the new designs incorporated details already popular at the time such as broad shoulders or [[Overskirt|peplums]]: later in the decade and into the 1990s, simpler designs in a variety of lengths and fullness were popular. The [[Grunge#Presentation and fashion|grunge]] culture of the 1990s saw the combination of the little black dress with both sandals and [[combat boots]], though the dress itself remained simple in cut and fabric.\n\nThe new glamour of the late 1990s led to new variations of the dress but, like the 1950s and the 1970s, colour re-emerged as a factor in fashion and formalwear and repeatedly shows an aversion to black. The resurgence of body conscious clothing, muted colour schemes, and the reemergence of predominant black, along with the retrospective trends of the 1980s in the late 2000s paved way to the return of interest to the dress.\n\n==Famous little black dresses==\n\nThe [[black Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn]] as Holly Golightly in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s]]'', designed by [[Hubert de Givenchy]], epitomized the standard for wearing little black dresses accessorized with pearls (together called \"basic black\"), as was frequently seen throughout the early 1960s.
