Pisa 1909|Pisa]], [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[Inter Milan]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]. He won a [[Double (association football)#Spain|domestic double]] with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1996, and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] with Inter in [[1998 UEFA Cup Final|1998]], also winning another [[Double (association football)#Italy|domestic double]] with Lazio in 2000, as well as the [[1999 UEFA Super Cup]] and the [[2000 Supercoppa Italiana]]. Simeone was [[Cap (sports)|capped]] over [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|100]] times for the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] and represented the country at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s, and in four editions of the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], winning the tournament in [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1991]] and [[1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1993]]. He also won the [[King Fahd Cup]] in [[1992 King Fahd Cup|1992]], and a silver medal at the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympic games]].\n\nAs a manager, Simeone has coached Argentine sides Racing Club, [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] and Italian club [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] before joining Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2011. He won the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] both with Estudiantes and River Plate, and has had his biggest managerial success with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, winning La Liga, the [[Copa del Rey]], two [[UEFA Europa League]]s, two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, and also being runner-up of the [[UEFA Champions League]] twice.\n\n==Club career==\n[[File:Simeone 1987.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Simeone with [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]] in 1987]]\nWhen Simeone was 14, his youth coach [[Victorio Spinetto]] nicknamed him \"''[[Cholo]]''\", as his energetic play reminded him of former [[Boca Juniors]] player and Argentine international [[Carmelo Simeone]] (no relation) who possessed the nickname.<ref name=\"ole.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/diario/2002/06/05/m-397561.htm |title=Jens Fjellstr\u00f6m ny tr\u00e4nare i Malm\u00f6 FF (Jens Fjellstr\u00f6m new coach in Malm\u00f6 FF) |publisher=aftonbladet.se |date=26 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nAfter starting his career with [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]], Simeone moved to Italian [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Pisa 1909|Pisa]] in 1990. The club was relegated in his [[1990\u201391 Serie A|first season]] and, after it failed to gain promotion the [[1991\u201392 Serie B|following year]], Simeone was sold to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the Spanish [[La Liga]]. Simeone played two seasons in Seville, after which he was signed by [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]]. At Atl\u00e9tico, he was part of the team which won the [[Double (association football)|double]] of the [[List of Spanish football champions|Liga title]] and [[1995\u201396 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] during the [[1995\u201396 La Liga|1995\u201396 season]].\n\nIn 1997, Simeone returned to Serie A with [[Inter Milan]] and played two full seasons, winning the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup]] in a side spearheaded by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] up front. In 1999, Simeone joined fellow Argentines [[N\u00e9stor Sensini]], [[Mat\u00edas Almeyda]], [[Hern\u00e1n Crespo]] and [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] at [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]'s [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. The side had gone close to the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' in the season before Simeone's arrival and he helped deliver the championship after [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|a season]], where [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] led the standings by two points going into the last day. A Juve loss at rainy [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] coupled with Lazio's comfortable home win over [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] ensured Simeone's first Serie A title. After winning the double in Spain, he would then add the Italian double as Lazio edged out Inter to claim the [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia]].\n\nHe went on to play three more seasons in Rome, which included more last day drama as Simeone's goal against former club Inter on the last day of the [[2001\u201302 Serie A|2001\u201302 campaign]] effectively ruined his old employers' title dream.\n\nSimeone returned to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2003, spending his next two seasons there. In total, he played in 165 matches for Atl\u00e9tico, scoring 31 goals. In 2005, he left Europe to finish his playing career in Argentina with [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]].\n\n==International career==\nIn 1992, Simeone represented the Argentina under-23 team at the [[1992 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament]] in Paraguay, which saw Argentina fail to qualify for the 1992 Summer Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/argentina-v-bolivia-02-february-1992-243429/|title=Argentina v Bolivia, 02 February 1992|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina senior team]], Simeone amassed [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|106 caps]],<ref name=\"RSSSF\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/arg-recintlp.html |title=RSSSF Argentine international players |publisher=Rsssf.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4olopA?url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/arg-recintlp.html |archivedate=17 January 2010}}</ref> the first coming in 1988.\n\nSimeone won the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica 1991|1991]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica 1993|1993]] editions of the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] with Argentina.

In this formation, the two wingers move inside and act like attacking midfielders, creating space for the full backs and fluidity in the attack, effectively being a 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 when the team is on the offensive. The two holding midfielders provide the defensive muscle needed to win midfield battles. Utilizing this formation, Simeone's Estudiantes won the [[2006\u201307 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|2006 Apertura]] by beating [[Boca Juniors]] 2\u20131 while being down to ten men from the first half. It is essentially this formation that Simeone also utilizes at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Simeone has listed his coaching influences being [[Marcelo Bielsa]], [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]], [[Alfio Basile]], [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Luigi Simoni]], [[Carlos Bilardo]] and [[Radomir Anti\u0107]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/07/04/investigating-the-origins-of-cholismo/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000510/https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/07/04/investigating-the-origins-of-cholismo/ |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was manager at River Plate, a team graced with the attacking talents of [[Radamel Falcao]], [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]], [[Ariel Ortega]], [[Mauro Rosales]], [[Diego Buonanotte]], [[Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Sebasti\u00e1n Abreu]], Simeone played an aggressive 3\u20133\u20131\u20133 formation reminiscent of those used by influential manager (and Simeone's mentor) [[Marcelo Bielsa]].<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-finishing-bottom-argentine-league-8062543</ref> Using this formation, River won the [[2007\u201308 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|2008 Clausura]], but in the next season, with S\u00e1nchez having returned to [[Udinese]] and several players suffering from injuries, the 3\u20133\u20131\u20133 backfired and River finished bottom of the table, with Simeone being sacked in the process.<ref>\u2013https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-finishing-bottom-argentine-league-8062543</ref>\n\nA common feature of Simeone's teams is defensive compactness and quick counter-attacks. Their defending consists of two stages: deep defending in their own defensive third in a narrow 4\u20134\u20132 consisting of two closely connected defensive lines of four players, and counter-pressing in their opponents' third to win the ball high up the pitch. When the ball is won, the team attack as a unit, deploying their fluid 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation, with the forwards often shifting to the flanks to create even more space.<ref>http://www.zonalmarking.net/2015/02/10/atletico-madrid-4-0-real-madrid-atletico-solid-in-central-areas-when-defending-and-fluid-to-cause-overloads-out-wide-when-attacking/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j6ZT_NFJ8U</ref> In defense, the key idea is to force opponents into wide areas, gain numerical dominance in the ball's zone and steal the ball or force the opponent into a backward pass.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j6ZT_NFJ8U</ref> Counter-pressing consists of reducing an opposing team's space, disrupting their build-up and reducing the number of \"safe\" positions for opponents' movement on the pitch, thus eliminating goal threats.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j6ZT_NFJ8U</ref> [[Claudio Ranieri]]'s [[Premier League]]-winning [[2015-16 Leicester City F.C. season|2015-16 Leicester City]] team has been compared to Simeone's Atletico Madrid for upsetting bigger teams by also playing a narrow 4\u20134\u20132 and being compact in defense and midfield.<ref>http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/04/27/22851442/filipe-luis-leicester-are-like-atletico</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/07/atletico-madrid-title-win-leicester-president</ref>\n\nIn the short time he managed Italian side Catania in 2011, he switched between a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 and a 4\u20133\u20131\u20132 in order to bring out the best from playmaker [[Adri\u00e1n Ricchiuti]] while employing many of the counter-attacking features that would later become his trademark at Atl\u00e9tico. Ricchiuti was tasked with linking the midfield and attack and creating chances for whichever of [[Maxi L\u00f3pez]], [[Gonzalo Bergessio]] and [[Francesco Lodi]] were selected up front. Simeone said he did not want to \u201cfossilise [himself] with a rigid tactic,\u201d saying managers cannot have a favourite formation \u201cfor the simple fact that we have to adapt not to what we like but to what we have to work with\u201d.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2019/feb/20/diego-simeone-italy-catania-atletico-madrid</ref> His players stayed compact and narrow when defending, with the widemen \u2013 two of [[Ezequiel Schelotto]], [[Giuseppe Mascara]], [[Raphael Martinho]] and [[Papu G\u00f3mez|Alejandro G\u00f3mez]] \u2013 expected to drop back and tuck in when out of possession; meanwhile, playmaker Ricchiuti and the central striker \u2013 more often than not L\u00f3pez \u2013 moved back into midfield rather than pressing the centre-backs, with the aim being preventing simple passes into the middle of the pitch.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2019/feb/20/diego-simeone-italy-catania-atletico-madrid</ref>\n\nSimeone is also renowned for his attention to detail and quick adaptability to a game's changing situations. During his time as manager of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, he has placed emphasis on creating chances from set-pieces, while not allowing the opponent to create chances from set-pieces. Several important goals, including the one that gave Atl\u00e9tico the 2014 La Liga title, have been scored from set-pieces.<ref>http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/05/19/barcelona-1-1-atletico-simeones-side-seal-historic-title-victory-at-the-camp-nou/</ref> While his teams aren't known for controlling possession, they are lauded for controlling the pace and space in which a game is played. He is quick in making tactical changes to influence a game's outcome. In the [[2015-16 UEFA Champions League]] semi-final against Bayern in Munich, with his team down 1\u20130 after 45 minutes, he moved [[Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez]] from the right wing to a holding midfielder position, changing the 4\u20134\u20132 to a 4\u20131\u20134\u20131 formation with [[Yannick Carrasco|Carrasco]] and Griezmann on the flanks. While on paper Sa\u00fal was seemingly out of his normal position in this role, in effect this change meant that midfielders [[Gabi (footballer)|Gabi]] and [[Koke (footballer, born 1992)|Koke]], who were overwhelmed in the first half by Bayern's pressure, would now be shielded by Sa\u00fal's presence behind them, and the midfield would regain its much-needed composure. Eventually, the change had the desired outcome, with Atl\u00e9tico equalizing through [[Antoine Griezmann]] and advancing to the Champions League final.<ref>http://www.football-lineups.com/match/235316/</ref><ref>http://www.zonalmarking.net/2016/05/05/atletico-madrid-2-2-bayern-munich-atletico-progress-on-away-goals/</ref>\n\nSimeone has also earned praise for instilling confidence and discipline in his players, which has helped his teams emerge victorious under adverse conditions. For example, in the last game of 2014's La Liga, at the [[Camp Nou]] against Barcelona, when Atl\u00e9tico needed a draw to win the championship, both [[Diego Costa]] and [[Arda Turan]] were taken out of the game due to injury in the first half, and Barcelona opened the scoring. However, Simeone was able to rally his team at half-time and Godin's header in the second half gave them the much needed draw. Simeone said: \"At half-time I told them to be relaxed. In the first half we did well. I knew if we scored, it would cost them. That's what happened. There was an amazing collective effort from everyone.\"<ref>http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2014/05/17/4824696/simeone-im-sure-aragones-was-defending-with-us</ref> During a leg in the [[2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League]] semi-final against [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] at the [[Emirates Stadium]], Atl\u00e9tico were playing without key players [[Diego Costa]], [[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]], [[Filipe Luis]] and [[Vitolo (footballer, born 1989)|Vitolo]], and in the 10th minute, [[Sime Vrsaljko]] was sent off with a red card, followed by Simeone being also sent off. Despite playing with ten men, without their manager at the bench, with most players in makeshift positions, and enjoying only 24% of ball possession, the team lost neither its shape nor its composure, eventually holding out to a 1\u20131 draw that was enough for them to progress to the final.<ref>http://www.football-lineups.com/match/285420/</ref> \u201cSimeone taught us to enjoy suffering,\u201d Arda Turan said in 2015, supporting this feeling that the Argentinean coach is a man who takes the best things out of bad situations.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-finishing-bottom-argentine-league-8062543</ref> Diego Godin has also said about his manager: \"\"The players would die for him [Simeone]. He gives belief that we can compete against much bigger teams. We have great confidence in him, we are with him to the death and also he with us - and that shows on the pitch. I believe the whole team has confidence in the coach and we all know the path we have to take: he marks the way for us and we go with him until the death. That is how you achieve things.\"<ref>http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3310/goal-50/2016/11/09/29340332/godin-were-with-simeone-until-the-death</ref><ref>https://www.scoopnest.com/user/ChampionsLeague/733260615314247680-godin-the-players-would-die-for-him-simeone-he-gives-belief-that-we-can-compete-against-much-bigger-teams</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSimeone's sons [[Giovanni Simeone|Giovanni]] and [[Gianluca Simeone|Gianluca]] are professional footballers, currently playing for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima]] respectively.<ref name=\"50 best young footballers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2017/jan/24/50-best-young-footballers-italy-serie-a|title=The 50 best young footballers in Italy|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Blair Newman|author2=Luca Hodges-Ramon|author3=Richard Hall|author4=Franco Ficetola|author5=Mark Neale|author6=Emmet Gates|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Business Standard\">{{cite news|title=Gianluca Simeone, son of Atleti manager, signs with Argentine club|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/gianluca-simeone-son-of-atleti-manager-signs-with-argentine-club-119010801308_1.html|accessdate=9 January 2019|work=Business Standard|date=8 January 2019}}</ref> His third son, Giuliano, has been seen as a ball-boy for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/en/2015/01/08/en/football/spanish_football/1420675239.html|title=Who did Simeone celebrate the goals with?|last=MARCA.com|date=8 January 2015|website=MARCA|language=en|access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n:Source:<ref>{{NFT |10041|name=Diego Simeone|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Super Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield|V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield]]\n|[[1987\u201388 Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina|1987\u201388]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]]\n|28||4||||||||||||||||\n|-\n|[[1988\u201389 Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina|1988\u201389]]\n|16||2||||||||||||||||\n|-\n|[[1989-90 Primera Divisi\u00f3n Argentina|1989\u201390]]\n|32||8||||||||||||||||\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!76||14||||||||||||||||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Pisa Calcio|Pisa]]\n|[[1990\u201391 Serie A|1990\u201391]]\n|[[Serie A]]\n|31||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||4\n|-\n|1991\u201392||[[Serie B]]\n|24||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!55||6||2||0||0||0||0||0||57||6\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]\n|[[1992\u201393 La Liga|1992\u201393]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[La Liga]]\n|33||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||33||4\n|-\n|[[1993\u201394 La Liga|1993\u201394]]\n|31||8||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||8\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!64||12||0||0||||||||||64||12\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]]\n|[[1994\u201395 La Liga|1994\u201395]]\n|rowspan=\"3\"|La Liga\n|29||6||8||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||8\n|-\n|[[1995\u201396 La Liga|1995\u201396]]\n|37||12||8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||45||12\n|-\n|[[1996\u201397 La Liga|1996\u201397]]\n|32||3||3||0||2||0||7||4||44||7\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!98||21||19||2||2||0||7||4||126||27\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Inter Milan]]\n|[[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Serie A\n|30||6||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||1||41||7\n|-\n|[[1998\u201399 Serie A|1998\u201399]]\n|27||5||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||2||43||7\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!57||11||9||0||0||0||18||3||84||14\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[S.S.

The club was relegated in his [[1990\u201391 Serie A|first season]] and, after it failed to gain promotion the [[1991\u201392 Serie B|following year]], Simeone was sold to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the Spanish [[La Liga]]. Simeone played two seasons in Seville, after which he was signed by [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]]. At Atl\u00e9tico, he was part of the team which won the [[Double (association football)|double]] of the [[List of Spanish football champions|Liga title]] and [[1995\u201396 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] during the [[1995\u201396 La Liga|1995\u201396 season]].\n\nIn 1997, Simeone returned to Serie A with [[Inter Milan]] and played two full seasons, winning the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup]] in a side spearheaded by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] up front.

A Juve loss at rainy [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] coupled with Lazio's comfortable home win over [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] ensured Simeone's first Serie A title. After winning the double in Spain, he would then add the Italian double as Lazio edged out Inter to claim the [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia]].\n\nHe went on to play three more seasons in Rome, which included more last day drama as Simeone's goal against former club Inter on the last day of the [[2001\u201302 Serie A|2001\u201302 campaign]] effectively ruined his old employers' title dream.\n\nSimeone returned to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2003, spending his next two seasons there.

After the final goal, Real Madrid's [[Rapha\u00ebl Varane]] kicked the ball towards Simeone, causing Simeone to run onto the pitch in anger.

In response, Atl\u00e9tico acquired striker [[Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107]] from [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], goalkeeper [[Jan Oblak]] from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and forwards [[Antoine Griezmann]] from [[Real Sociedad]] and [[\u00c1ngel Correa]] from [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]], and recover young midfielder [[Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez|Sa\u00fal]] who was on loan at [[Rayo Vallecano]]. The season started with Atl\u00e9tico defeating city rivals Real Madrid for the [[2014 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a|Spanish Super Cup]] in August and repeating the previous year's victory in the Bernab\u00e9u for the league in September. In January, the team acquired [[Fernando Torres]] on loan from Milan. However, Atl\u00e9tico finished the league in third place and was eliminated in the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] quarter-finals by Real Madrid 1\u20130, on aggregate.\n\n====2015\u201316: Defensive records and second Champions League final====\nBefore the start of the season, Filipe Lu\u00eds returned from Chelsea with the team also acquiring Montenegrin defender [[Stefan Savi\u0107]] and Belgian midfielder [[Yannick Carrasco]]. Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 left for [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. In 2015\u201316, Atl\u00e9tico was the team with the best defensive record in Europe's \"big five\" leagues, only allowing 18 goals scored against them in 38 La Liga games. Atl\u00e9tico was also the team with the most clean sheets in their games. The team was contending the [[2015\u201316 La Liga|league title]] until the last fixture against Barcelona and Real Madrid, settling for third with 88 points. \n\nIn the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], Simeone led Atl\u00e9tico to their second Champions League final in three seasons, becoming the first Argentine manager since [[H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper]] to reach two Champions League finals. Atl\u00e9tico had defeated [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on penalties during the round of 16, beat defending champions Barcelona 3\u20132 on aggregate and favourites Bayern Munich 2\u20132, going through on away goals, setting up a repeat of the 2014 final again facing Real Madrid. The match ended 1\u20131 after extra time leading to a penalty shootout. [[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]] was the only player to miss his kick, enabling [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] to score Real's last spot kick, condemning Atl\u00e9tico to a second Champions League final defeat in three seasons.\n\n====2016\u201317====\nIn the summer of 2016, Atl\u00e9tico purchased forward [[Kevin Gameiro]] from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], midfielder [[Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n]] from Benfica, defender [[\u0160ime Vrsaljko]] from [[U.S. Sassuolo|Sassuolo]]. They also acquired the rights to Fernando Torres (previously on loan from Milan).

In this formation, the two wingers move inside and act like attacking midfielders, creating space for the full backs and fluidity in the attack, effectively being a 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 when the team is on the offensive. The two holding midfielders provide the defensive muscle needed to win midfield battles. Utilizing this formation, Simeone's Estudiantes won the [[2006\u201307 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|2006 Apertura]] by beating [[Boca Juniors]] 2\u20131 while being down to ten men from the first half. It is essentially this formation that Simeone also utilizes at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Simeone has listed his coaching influences being [[Marcelo Bielsa]], [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]], [[Alfio Basile]], [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Luigi Simoni]], [[Carlos Bilardo]] and [[Radomir Anti\u0107]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/07/04/investigating-the-origins-of-cholismo/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000510/https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/07/04/investigating-the-origins-of-cholismo/ |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was manager at River Plate, a team graced with the attacking talents of [[Radamel Falcao]], [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]], [[Ariel Ortega]], [[Mauro Rosales]], [[Diego Buonanotte]], [[Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez]] and [[Sebasti\u00e1n Abreu]], Simeone played an aggressive 3\u20133\u20131\u20133 formation reminiscent of those used by influential manager (and Simeone's mentor) [[Marcelo Bielsa]].<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-finishing-bottom-argentine-league-8062543</ref> Using this formation, River won the [[2007\u201308 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|2008 Clausura]], but in the next season, with S\u00e1nchez having returned to [[Udinese]] and several players suffering from injuries, the 3\u20133\u20131\u20133 backfired and River finished bottom of the table, with Simeone being sacked in the process.<ref>\u2013https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-finishing-bottom-argentine-league-8062543</ref>\n\nA common feature of Simeone's teams is defensive compactness and quick counter-attacks. Their defending consists of two stages: deep defending in their own defensive third in a narrow 4\u20134\u20132 consisting of two closely connected defensive lines of four players, and counter-pressing in their opponents' third to win the ball high up the pitch. When the ball is won, the team attack as a unit, deploying their fluid 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation, with the forwards often shifting to the flanks to create even more space.<ref>http://www.zonalmarking.net/2015/02/10/atletico-madrid-4-0-real-madrid-atletico-solid-in-central-areas-when-defending-and-fluid-to-cause-overloads-out-wide-when-attacking/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j6ZT_NFJ8U</ref> In defense, the key idea is to force opponents into wide areas, gain numerical dominance in the ball's zone and steal the ball or force the opponent into a backward pass.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j6ZT_NFJ8U</ref> Counter-pressing consists of reducing an opposing team's space, disrupting their build-up and reducing the number of \"safe\" positions for opponents' movement on the pitch, thus eliminating goal threats.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j6ZT_NFJ8U</ref> [[Claudio Ranieri]]'s [[Premier League]]-winning [[2015-16 Leicester City F.C. season|2015-16 Leicester City]] team has been compared to Simeone's Atletico Madrid for upsetting bigger teams by also playing a narrow 4\u20134\u20132 and being compact in defense and midfield.<ref>http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/04/27/22851442/filipe-luis-leicester-are-like-atletico</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/07/atletico-madrid-title-win-leicester-president</ref>\n\nIn the short time he managed Italian side Catania in 2011, he switched between a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 and a 4\u20133\u20131\u20132 in order to bring out the best from playmaker [[Adri\u00e1n Ricchiuti]] while employing many of the counter-attacking features that would later become his trademark at Atl\u00e9tico. Ricchiuti was tasked with linking the midfield and attack and creating chances for whichever of [[Maxi L\u00f3pez]], [[Gonzalo Bergessio]] and [[Francesco Lodi]] were selected up front. Simeone said he did not want to \u201cfossilise [himself] with a rigid tactic,\u201d saying managers cannot have a favourite formation \u201cfor the simple fact that we have to adapt not to what we like but to what we have to work with\u201d.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2019/feb/20/diego-simeone-italy-catania-atletico-madrid</ref> His players stayed compact and narrow when defending, with the widemen \u2013 two of [[Ezequiel Schelotto]], [[Giuseppe Mascara]], [[Raphael Martinho]] and [[Papu G\u00f3mez|Alejandro G\u00f3mez]] \u2013 expected to drop back and tuck in when out of possession; meanwhile, playmaker Ricchiuti and the central striker \u2013 more often than not L\u00f3pez \u2013 moved back into midfield rather than pressing the centre-backs, with the aim being preventing simple passes into the middle of the pitch.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2019/feb/20/diego-simeone-italy-catania-atletico-madrid</ref>\n\nSimeone is also renowned for his attention to detail and quick adaptability to a game's changing situations. During his time as manager of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, he has placed emphasis on creating chances from set-pieces, while not allowing the opponent to create chances from set-pieces. Several important goals, including the one that gave Atl\u00e9tico the 2014 La Liga title, have been scored from set-pieces.<ref>http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/05/19/barcelona-1-1-atletico-simeones-side-seal-historic-title-victory-at-the-camp-nou/</ref> While his teams aren't known for controlling possession, they are lauded for controlling the pace and space in which a game is played. He is quick in making tactical changes to influence a game's outcome. In the [[2015-16 UEFA Champions League]] semi-final against Bayern in Munich, with his team down 1\u20130 after 45 minutes, he moved [[Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez]] from the right wing to a holding midfielder position, changing the 4\u20134\u20132 to a 4\u20131\u20134\u20131 formation with [[Yannick Carrasco|Carrasco]] and Griezmann on the flanks. While on paper Sa\u00fal was seemingly out of his normal position in this role, in effect this change meant that midfielders [[Gabi (footballer)|Gabi]] and [[Koke (footballer, born 1992)|Koke]], who were overwhelmed in the first half by Bayern's pressure, would now be shielded by Sa\u00fal's presence behind them, and the midfield would regain its much-needed composure. Eventually, the change had the desired outcome, with Atl\u00e9tico equalizing through [[Antoine Griezmann]] and advancing to the Champions League final.<ref>http://www.football-lineups.com/match/235316/</ref><ref>http://www.zonalmarking.net/2016/05/05/atletico-madrid-2-2-bayern-munich-atletico-progress-on-away-goals/</ref>\n\nSimeone has also earned praise for instilling confidence and discipline in his players, which has helped his teams emerge victorious under adverse conditions. For example, in the last game of 2014's La Liga, at the [[Camp Nou]] against Barcelona, when Atl\u00e9tico needed a draw to win the championship, both [[Diego Costa]] and [[Arda Turan]] were taken out of the game due to injury in the first half, and Barcelona opened the scoring. However, Simeone was able to rally his team at half-time and Godin's header in the second half gave them the much needed draw. Simeone said: \"At half-time I told them to be relaxed. In the first half we did well. I knew if we scored, it would cost them. That's what happened. There was an amazing collective effort from everyone.\"<ref>http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2014/05/17/4824696/simeone-im-sure-aragones-was-defending-with-us</ref> During a leg in the [[2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League]] semi-final against [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] at the [[Emirates Stadium]], Atl\u00e9tico were playing without key players [[Diego Costa]], [[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]], [[Filipe Luis]] and [[Vitolo (footballer, born 1989)|Vitolo]], and in the 10th minute, [[Sime Vrsaljko]] was sent off with a red card, followed by Simeone being also sent off. Despite playing with ten men, without their manager at the bench, with most players in makeshift positions, and enjoying only 24% of ball possession, the team lost neither its shape nor its composure, eventually holding out to a 1\u20131 draw that was enough for them to progress to the final.<ref>http://www.football-lineups.com/match/285420/</ref> \u201cSimeone taught us to enjoy suffering,\u201d Arda Turan said in 2015, supporting this feeling that the Argentinean coach is a man who takes the best things out of bad situations.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-finishing-bottom-argentine-league-8062543</ref> Diego Godin has also said about his manager: \"\"The players would die for him [Simeone]. He gives belief that we can compete against much bigger teams. We have great confidence in him, we are with him to the death and also he with us - and that shows on the pitch.

Incorporated as the '''Resort Municipality of Whistler (RMOW)''', it has a permanent population of approximately 11,854, plus a larger but rotating population of seasonal workers, typically younger people from beyond British Columbia, notably from United Kingdom, [[Australia]] and [[Europe]].\n\nOver two million people visit Whistler annually, primarily for [[alpine skiing]] and snowboarding and, in summer, [[mountain biking]] at [[Whistler Blackcomb]]. Its pedestrian village has won numerous design awards and Whistler has been voted among the top destinations in [[North America]] by major ski magazines since the mid-1990s. During the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Whistler hosted most of the alpine, [[Nordic skiing|Nordic]], [[luge]], [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]], and [[bobsleigh|bobsled]] events.\n\n== History ==\n{{Historical populations\n|1981|1369\n|1986|2002\n|1991|4459\n|1996|7172\n|2001|8896\n|2006|9754\n\n|2011|9824\n|2016|11854\n|footnote=<ref>[http://estat2.statcan.gc.ca/cgi-win/cnsmcgi.pgm Population 1981/1986]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n}}\nThe Whistler Valley is located around the pass between the headwaters of the [[Green River (British Columbia)|Green River]] and the upper-middle reaches of the [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]]. It is flanked by glaciated mountains on both sides; the [[Garibaldi Ranges]] on the side that contains the ski mountains, and a group of ranges with no collective name but which are part of the larger [[Pacific Ranges]] and are essentially fore-ranges of the [[Pemberton Icefield]]. Although there are a few other routes through the maze of mountains between the basin of the [[Lillooet River]] just east, the Cheakamus-Green divide is the lowest and most direct. \n\nThe first British survey by the [[Royal Navy]] took place in the 1860s.<ref>[http://www.britishcolumbia.com/regions/towns/?townID=3379 BritishColumbia.com] - Whistler, British Columbia</ref> These surveyors named the mountain London Mountain because of the heavy fog and cloud typically gathering around the mountain, but the area informally acquired the name \"Whistler\" due to the call of the [[hoary marmot]].<ref>[http://www.britishcolumbia.com/general/details.asp?id=19 BritishColumbia.com] - History and Heritage of Whistler Mountain</ref> In the late 19th century, a [[Lillooet Cattle Trail|trail]] was cut through the valley, linking [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] via [[Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton]] with Burrard Inlet via a pass from Squamish to the Seymour River. The trail was completed in 1877, but because of the difficult and unforgiving terrain, it was only used once for its intended purpose, which was to drive cattle. The area began to attract trappers and prospectors (such as John Millar and Henry Horstman) who established small camps in the area in the early 20th century. The area began to gain recognition with the arrival of Myrtle and Alex Philip, who in 1914 purchased {{convert|10|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land on Alta Lake and established the [[Rainbow Lodge]]. The Philips had relocated from [[Maine]] to [[Vancouver]] in 1910, and had heard rumours of the natural beauty of the area from Pemberton pioneer John Millar.<ref>[https://blog.whistlermuseum.org/2011/07/16/the-story-behind-100-years-of-dreams/ blog.whistlermuseum.org]</ref> After an exploratory journey, the couple was convinced. Rainbow Lodge and other railway-dependent tourist resorts were collectively known as [[Alta Lake, British Columbia|Alta Lake]]. Along with the rest of the valley bridging the Cheakamus and Green River basins, they became part of British Columbia's first Resort Municipality in 1975.\n\nCompletion of the [[Pacific Great Eastern Railway]] in 1914 greatly reduced the travel time from three days, providing ease of access from Vancouver, and the Rainbow Lodge gained a reputation as the most popular vacation destination west of the Rockies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The lodge was primarily a summer destination, with boating, fishing and hiking among the most popular activities, and soon other lodges began to open not just on Alta Lake, but on other valley lakes as well.\n\nAppreciation of the outdoors was not the only activity in the valley, however. Logging was a boom industry. During the first half of the 20th century, most of the lower slopes of the surrounding mountains were cleared of old growth. At its peak, four mills were in operation, most located around Green Lake. Prospecting and trapping were pursued as well, though no claims of great value were ever staked.\n\n==Activities== \nWhistler is known for its [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] in the winter and [[mountain biking]] and [[hiking]] in the summer. There are also many other activities such as [[golfing]], [[fishing]] and [[trail running]]. \n\nFor skiing, the different run difficulties (easiest to hardest) are Green (circle), Blue (square), Black (diamond), Double Black (diamond). Throughout the year each run's difficulty stays the same.<ref>[https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-mountain/about-the-mountain/trail-maps.aspx whistlerblackcomb.com]</ref>\n\n== 1968 and 1976 Winter Olympic bids==\nUntil the 1960s, this quiet area was without basic infrastructure. There were no sewage facilities, water, or electricity, and no road from [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] or [[Vancouver]]. In 1962, four Vancouver businessmen began to explore the area with the intent of building a ski resort and bidding for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]]. Garibaldi Lift Company was formed, shares were sold, and in 1966, [[Whistler Mountain]] opened to the public.\n\nLater, the town, then still known as [[Alta Lake, British Columbia|Alta Lake]], was offered the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] after the selected host city [[Denver]] declined the games due to funding issues. Alta Lake ''Whistler'' declined as well, after elections ushered in a local government less enthusiastic about the Olympics. The 1976 Winter Olympics were ultimately held in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].\n\n==2010 Winter Olympics==\n[[File:2009-0605-Ilanaaq-2010Oly-Whistler.jpg|thumb|A statue of Ilanaaq, mascot of the 2010 Olympics, located on Whistler Mountain]]\n\nWhistler was the Host Mountain Resort of the Vancouver [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], the first time the [[International Olympic Committee]] has bestowed that designation on a community. Whistler hosted the alpine technical and speed events, [[Whistler Sliding Centre|the sliding events at]] [[Fitzsimmons Creek]], the [[Whistler Olympic Park|Nordic events in]] the nearby [[Callaghan Valley]] and all the Paralympic events except the opening ceremonies, sledge hockey and wheelchair curling.\n\nThe [[Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village]] (commonly referred to as the Athlete's village) housed around 2,400 athletes, coaches, trainers and officials. Post-games, the site has been turned into a new residential neighbourhood [[Cheakamus Crossing]].\n\n== Transportation ==\nWhistler is located on [[British Columbia Highway 99]], also known as the \"Sea to Sky Highway\", approximately {{convert|58|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]], and 125&nbsp;km (76&nbsp;mi) from Vancouver. The highway connects Whistler to the [[British Columbia Interior]] via [[Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton]]-[[Mount Currie, British Columbia|Mount Currie]] to [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] and connections beyond to the [[Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada]] and [[Cariboo Highway]]s.\n\nElite-class rail service is only provided at the [[Whistler railway station]] between Vancouver and Jasper by the [[Rocky Mountaineer]], using [[Canadian National Railway]] tracks from North Vancouver via Whistler and Prince George. The station for tour passengers embarking from [https://www.limobook.ca/whistler-limousine-service Whistler] is in the Southside area, between Nita and Alpha Lakes.\n\nLocal bus transit service is provided by the [[Whistler and Valley Express]], which also provides service to [[Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton]]. \n\nA shuttle bus service from the Vancouver Airport and [[Downtown Vancouver]] is provided by the [[Whistler Shuttle]] and [[YVR Skylynx]].<ref>[http://www.ridebooker.com/transfers/yvr/whistler/whistler-shuttle Whistler Shuttle]</ref><ref>[https://www.yvrskylynx.com YVR Skylynx]</ref>\n\n=== Vancouver International Airport ===\n[[Vancouver International Airport]] {{Airport codes|YVR|CYVR}}<ref name=\"cfs\">{{CFS}}</ref> is the main international airport for Whistler residents and tourists and is located {{Convert|140|km|abbr=on}} south.\n\n=== Pemberton Regional Airport===\n[[Pemberton Regional Airport]] {{Airport codes||CYPS}}<ref name=\"cfs\"/> is a public airport serving Pemberton and Whistler.

Although there are a few other routes through the maze of mountains between the basin of the [[Lillooet River]] just east, the Cheakamus-Green divide is the lowest and most direct. \n\nThe first British survey by the [[Royal Navy]] took place in the 1860s.<ref>[http://www.britishcolumbia.com/regions/towns/?townID=3379 BritishColumbia.com] - Whistler, British Columbia</ref> These surveyors named the mountain London Mountain because of the heavy fog and cloud typically gathering around the mountain, but the area informally acquired the name \"Whistler\" due to the call of the [[hoary marmot]].<ref>[http://www.britishcolumbia.com/general/details.asp?id=19 BritishColumbia.com] - History and Heritage of Whistler Mountain</ref> In the late 19th century, a [[Lillooet Cattle Trail|trail]] was cut through the valley, linking [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] via [[Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton]] with Burrard Inlet via a pass from Squamish to the Seymour River. The trail was completed in 1877, but because of the difficult and unforgiving terrain, it was only used once for its intended purpose, which was to drive cattle. The area began to attract trappers and prospectors (such as John Millar and Henry Horstman) who established small camps in the area in the early 20th century. The area began to gain recognition with the arrival of Myrtle and Alex Philip, who in 1914 purchased {{convert|10|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land on Alta Lake and established the [[Rainbow Lodge]]. The Philips had relocated from [[Maine]] to [[Vancouver]] in 1910, and had heard rumours of the natural beauty of the area from Pemberton pioneer John Millar.<ref>[https://blog.whistlermuseum.org/2011/07/16/the-story-behind-100-years-of-dreams/ blog.whistlermuseum.org]</ref> After an exploratory journey, the couple was convinced. Rainbow Lodge and other railway-dependent tourist resorts were collectively known as [[Alta Lake, British Columbia|Alta Lake]]. Along with the rest of the valley bridging the Cheakamus and Green River basins, they became part of British Columbia's first Resort Municipality in 1975.\n\nCompletion of the [[Pacific Great Eastern Railway]] in 1914 greatly reduced the travel time from three days, providing ease of access from Vancouver, and the Rainbow Lodge gained a reputation as the most popular vacation destination west of the Rockies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The lodge was primarily a summer destination, with boating, fishing and hiking among the most popular activities, and soon other lodges began to open not just on Alta Lake, but on other valley lakes as well.\n\nAppreciation of the outdoors was not the only activity in the valley, however. Logging was a boom industry. During the first half of the 20th century, most of the lower slopes of the surrounding mountains were cleared of old growth. At its peak, four mills were in operation, most located around Green Lake. Prospecting and trapping were pursued as well, though no claims of great value were ever staked.\n\n==Activities== \nWhistler is known for its [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] in the winter and [[mountain biking]] and [[hiking]] in the summer. There are also many other activities such as [[golfing]], [[fishing]] and [[trail running]]. \n\nFor skiing, the different run difficulties (easiest to hardest) are Green (circle), Blue (square), Black (diamond), Double Black (diamond). Throughout the year each run's difficulty stays the same.<ref>[https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-mountain/about-the-mountain/trail-maps.aspx whistlerblackcomb.com]</ref>\n\n== 1968 and 1976 Winter Olympic bids==\nUntil the 1960s, this quiet area was without basic infrastructure. There were no sewage facilities, water, or electricity, and no road from [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] or [[Vancouver]]. In 1962, four Vancouver businessmen began to explore the area with the intent of building a ski resort and bidding for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]]. Garibaldi Lift Company was formed, shares were sold, and in 1966, [[Whistler Mountain]] opened to the public.\n\nLater, the town, then still known as [[Alta Lake, British Columbia|Alta Lake]], was offered the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] after the selected host city [[Denver]] declined the games due to funding issues. Alta Lake ''Whistler'' declined as well, after elections ushered in a local government less enthusiastic about the Olympics. The 1976 Winter Olympics were ultimately held in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].\n\n==2010 Winter Olympics==\n[[File:2009-0605-Ilanaaq-2010Oly-Whistler.jpg|thumb|A statue of Ilanaaq, mascot of the 2010 Olympics, located on Whistler Mountain]]\n\nWhistler was the Host Mountain Resort of the Vancouver [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], the first time the [[International Olympic Committee]] has bestowed that designation on a community.

Shows used to have higher ratings in 2000s as compared to present decade. The present shows that regularly score above or around the 3.5 mark are [[Kumkum Bhagya]], and its spin off [[Kundali Bhagya]] along with [[Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai]]. Sometimes these shows touch 4 which is still quite low as compared to highest rated shows of the last decade. Other than that [[Naagin (2015 TV series)]] is the only show now that scores above 4.7. All of these shows are produced by the same banner [[Balaji Telefilms]] except Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. Currently, [[Bigg Boss (Hindi season 13)|Bigg Boss 13]] has been the most watched Show of 2020, recording an 11.3 TRP for the Final and an average of 8.3 TRP on regular episodes,being the most watched reality show in [[India]].

It has a rich literature and is used in schools. It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) language, derived from [[Sanskrit]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]] ruled [[Sindh]] for more than 150 years after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered it in 712&nbsp; AD, remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule. Consequently, the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken by over 36 million people in Pakistan and is the official language of Sindh province. It is widely spoken in the [[Lasbela District]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] (where the [[Lasi]] tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi), many areas of the [[Nasirabad District|Naseerabad]] and [[Jafarabad District|Jafarabad]] districts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad. The Sindhi language has six major [[dialect]]s: Sireli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kachhi. It is written in the [[Arabic script]] with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking cities are [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sukkur]], [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Dadu, Pakistan|Dadu]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]], [[Mirpur Khas]], [[Thatta]], [[Badin]] and [[Nawabshah]]. [[Sindhi literature]] is also spiritual in nature. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhita'i]] (1689\u20131752) is one of its greatest poets, and wrote [[Sassi Punnun]] and [[Umar Marvi]], folk stories, in his famous book ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''.\n\nSindhi dialects:\n* '''Sindhi Saraiki''' \u2013 spoken mainly in Upper [[Sindh]]\n* '''Vicholi''' \u2013 in Vicholo, i.e. Central [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lari''' \u2013 in Laru, i.e. Lower [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lasi''' \u2013 in Lasa B\u2019elo, a part of Kohistan in [[Baluchistan]] on the western side of [[Sindh]]\n* '''Thari or Thareli''' \u2013 in Tharu, the desert region on the southeast border of [[Sindh]] and a part of the [[Jaisalmer district]] in Rajasthan\n* '''Kachhi''' \u2013 in the [[Kutch]] region and in a part of Kathiawar in [[Gujarat]], on the southern side of [[Sindh]]\n\nVicholi is considered as the standard dialect by all Sindhi speakers.\n\n====Saraiki====\n[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], sometimes spelled Seraiki and Siraiki, is spoken as a first language by about 20 million people, mostly in the southern districts of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]: Multan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan. It is also spoken by the majority of the population of [[Dera Ismail Khan District]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, Kachi plain of Balochistan, northern parts of Sindh, and cities of Hyderabad and Karachi.\n\n====Balochi====\n[[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a provincial language spoken as the first language by about 3.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. [[Sindh]] and southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The name ''Balochi'' or ''Baluchi'' is not found before the 10th century. It is believed that the language was brought to its present location in a series of migrations [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. [[Rakshani]] is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. [[Sarhaddi]], is a sub dialect of Rakshani. Other sub \u2013 dialects are [[Qalati]], [[Chagai Kharani]], and [[Makrani]]. The Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi are distinct dialects. The Kethran language in North East Balochistan is also a variant of Balochi. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan. Since [[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a poetic and rich language and have a certain degree of affinity to [[Urdu language|Urdu]], Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well as Ata Shaad, [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] and [[Noon Meem Danish]] are excellent examples of this.\n\n====Brahui====\n[[Brahui language|Brahui]] ({{lang-ur| \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u06cc  '}}) is a regional language of uncertain origin despite the fact that the bulk of the language shares lexical similarities to [[Balochi language|Balochi]] as well as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. In colonial times, many British linguists tried to make the claim of a possible [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] origin but this has not been conclusively proven despite ongoing research in the language for a century now.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">Vogelsang, Wilhelm ''The Afghans'' Wiley-Blackwell 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-631-19841-3}} pp.61\u201362 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&pg=RA1-PA61&dq=Brahui+dravidian#PRA1-PA62,M1]</ref> spoken in southern Pakistan, may have evolved from the original languages of [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus valley civilizations]] at [[Mehrgarh]].

There are over 500,000<ref name=\"Pakistan\"/> Gujari speakers in Pakistan.\n\n====Arabic====\n{{main|Arab\u2013Pakistan relations}}\n[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is considered to be a religious language in Pakistan. The [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with [[Urdu language|Urdu]] translation. The large numbers of Pakistanis living in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and in other Middle Eastern countries has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in Mosques, Schools, Colleges, Universities and [[Madrasah|Madrassahs]]. Nearly all of Pakistan's Muslim population has had some form of education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]].\n\nMany [[Arab people|Arabs]] who took part in [[Afghanistan]] war have now settled in [[Pakistan]] permanently with their families. Millions of Pakistanis that have worked in Middle East also speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as a second language.\n\n====Other Pakistani languages====\nNumerous other languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people, especially in some of the more remote and isolated places in, for example, the [[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas of Pakistan]].<ref name=ethnologue1>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Pakistan|title=Ethnologue report for Pakistan: Languages of Pakistan|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040901094949/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Pakistan|archive-date=1 September 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in Pakistan include [[Pothohari language|Pothohari]], [[Shina language|Shina]], Balti, [[Gojri language|Gujjari]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Marwari language|Marwari]], [[Memoni]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]], and [[Dari (Persian)|Dari Persian]].

Usually concentrated in the heavily populated areas east of the [[Indus River|Indus river]], the Indo-Aryan languages and their cultures form the predominant cultural group in the country. They derive their roots from the [[Sanskrit]] language of Aryan invadors and are later heavily influenced by the languages of the later Muslim arrivals (i.e., Turkish, Persian, and Arabic), and are all written in a variant of either the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] or [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] script. Urdu, the country's national language, is an Indo-Aryan tongue. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]] and [[Seraiki language|Seraiki]], all [[mutually intelligible]], are classified by linguists as dialects of an Indo-Aryan speech called [[Lahnda languages|Lahnda]],<ref name=ethnologue2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90930|title=Browse by Language Family|work=Ethnologue}}</ref> also spelled as Lehnda. These are also, to a lesser extent, mutually intelligible with Urdu. Added together, speakers of these mutually-intelligible languages make up nearly two-thirds of Pakistan's population. [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is the common language of the people of [[Sindh]] in southern Pakistan and has a rich literary history of its own, traced back to the era of the early Arab arrivals. The Dardic languages of [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and the northwestern mountains are sometimes classified by many linguists as belonging to the Indo-Aryan family. Other Indo-Aryan languages include [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Memoni language|Memoni]] and others.\n\n=====Dardic languages=====\nThe [[Dardic languages]] are spoken in the northern Pakistan. They include [[Shina language|Shina]] (spoken in [[Gilgit]], [[Chilas]] and [[Diamer District|Diamar]]), [[Khowar language|Khowar]] (spoken in [[Chitral]], [[Ghizer]], [[Swat District|Swat]] and the balti language (spoken in [baltistan] including [skardu] district and [Ghanche] district.

[[Kalam Valley]] of upper [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]]), [[Kalasha-mun|Kalash]] (spoken by [[Kalash people|Kalash]] tribe), [[Kohistani language|Kohistani]] (spoken in upper [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] and [[Kohistan District (Pakistan)|Kohistan]]) and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] mostly by Immigrants from Kashmir valley and by a few in the [[Neelum District]].\n\nKashmiri spoken in north east [[Azad Kashmir]] and the adjacent Kashmir valley, (not to be confused with [[Pahari languages|Pahari language]] spoken in the lower [[Azad Kashmir]]) is one of the Dardic languages that has a literary tradition that goes well back into the history whereas other Dardic languages spoken in northern Pakistan, do not have written literature. It is believed to be the result of the northern areas of Pakistan having remained isolated in the mountain valleys from the others for centuries.\n\n=====Iranian=====\n[[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Yidgha]] and [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] are [[Eastern Iranian languages]] spoken in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and the [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] region of Pakistan.

This language change was designed to institute a universal language throughout the then British Raj in South Asia as well as minimize the influence that [[Persia]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Afghanistan had on this transitional region.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nUrdu is a relatively new language but has undergone considerable modification and development, with many borrowings from older languages such as Persian, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and other [[Languages of South Asia|South Asian languages]]. It is a standardized register of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and in its spoken form. It is widely used, both formally and informally, for personal letters as well as public literature, in the literary sphere and in the popular media. It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools. It is the first language of most [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] \u2013 Muslim refugees that arrived from different parts of [[India]] after the [[Pakistan movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and that form nearly 8% of Pakistan's population \u2013 and is an acquired language by nearly all of Pakistan's native ethnic groups. It is spoken by almost 92% of the population, making Pakistan a unique country in its choice of a national language. Urdu has been promoted as a token of national unity.\n\nIn recent years, the Urdu spoken in Pakistan has undergone further evolution and acquired a particularly \"Pakistani flavour\", often absorbing local native terminology and adopting a strong [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] leaning in terms of intonations and vocabulary. It is a modern language which is constantly evolving from its original form. It is written in a modified form of the [[Perso-Arabic script]], [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]], and its basic Hindi-based vocabulary has been enriched by words from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkic languages]] and English. Urdu has drawn inspiration from [[Persian literature]] and has now an enormous stock of words from that language.\n\nThe first poetry in Urdu was by the poet [[Amir Khusro]] (1253\u20131325) and the first Urdu book ''Woh Majlis'' was written in 1728; the first time the word \"Urdu\" was used was by [[Sirajuddin Ali Khan Arzoo]] in 1741.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nH1HBxdA1UIC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Siraj-ud-din+Arzoo+urdu#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Urdu/Hindi: An Artificial Divide|publisher=|isbn=9780875864389|last1=Khan|first1=Abdul Jamil|year=2006}}</ref> The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb|Aurangzeb Alamgir]] (1658\u20131707) spoke what the locals called ''Lashakri Zaban'' or what the Mughals called ''Zaban-i-Ordu'' (both meaning \"language of the [[Great Horde|Horde]]\"; commonly known as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] back then) fluently as did his descendants while his ancestors mostly spoke [[Persian language|Persian]] and a language [[Turkic language|related to Turkish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-246277088.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105204345/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-246277088.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-05|title=Bonds of Culture}}</ref>\n\n====Punjabi====\n[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is a provincial language spoken mostly in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], as well as by a large number of people in [[Karachi]]. Punjabi does not have any official status in Pakistan. The exact number of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan is hard to determine since the boundaries with the closely related [[Hindko]] and [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] are not always clear-cut. The standard Punjabi variety is from [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujranwala]] and [[Sheikhupura]] districts of Pakistani Punjab, and is also nowadays the language of Punjabi literature, film and music, such as [[Lollywood]].\n\n====Pashto====<!--Linked from [[Template:Pashtuns]]-->\n[[Pashto language|Pashto]] is a provincial language spoken as a first language by about 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] as well as by immigrants to the eastern provinces. There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern ([[Peshawar]]) variety and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas. There are also many Pakistanis from the adjacent regions of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] who are conversant in Pashto and count it as their second language.

It has a rich literature and is used in schools. It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) language, derived from [[Sanskrit]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]] ruled [[Sindh]] for more than 150 years after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered it in 712&nbsp; AD, remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule. Consequently, the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken by over 36 million people in Pakistan and is the official language of Sindh province. It is widely spoken in the [[Lasbela District]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] (where the [[Lasi]] tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi), many areas of the [[Nasirabad District|Naseerabad]] and [[Jafarabad District|Jafarabad]] districts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad. The Sindhi language has six major [[dialect]]s: Sireli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kachhi. It is written in the [[Arabic script]] with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking cities are [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sukkur]], [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Dadu, Pakistan|Dadu]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]], [[Mirpur Khas]], [[Thatta]], [[Badin]] and [[Nawabshah]]. [[Sindhi literature]] is also spiritual in nature. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhita'i]] (1689\u20131752) is one of its greatest poets, and wrote [[Sassi Punnun]] and [[Umar Marvi]], folk stories, in his famous book ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''.\n\nSindhi dialects:\n* '''Sindhi Saraiki''' \u2013 spoken mainly in Upper [[Sindh]]\n* '''Vicholi''' \u2013 in Vicholo, i.e. Central [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lari''' \u2013 in Laru, i.e. Lower [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lasi''' \u2013 in Lasa B\u2019elo, a part of Kohistan in [[Baluchistan]] on the western side of [[Sindh]]\n* '''Thari or Thareli''' \u2013 in Tharu, the desert region on the southeast border of [[Sindh]] and a part of the [[Jaisalmer district]] in Rajasthan\n* '''Kachhi''' \u2013 in the [[Kutch]] region and in a part of Kathiawar in [[Gujarat]], on the southern side of [[Sindh]]\n\nVicholi is considered as the standard dialect by all Sindhi speakers.\n\n====Saraiki====\n[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], sometimes spelled Seraiki and Siraiki, is spoken as a first language by about 20 million people, mostly in the southern districts of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]: Multan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan. It is also spoken by the majority of the population of [[Dera Ismail Khan District]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, Kachi plain of Balochistan, northern parts of Sindh, and cities of Hyderabad and Karachi.\n\n====Balochi====\n[[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a provincial language spoken as the first language by about 3.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. [[Sindh]] and southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The name ''Balochi'' or ''Baluchi'' is not found before the 10th century. It is believed that the language was brought to its present location in a series of migrations [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. [[Rakshani]] is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. [[Sarhaddi]], is a sub dialect of Rakshani. Other sub \u2013 dialects are [[Qalati]], [[Chagai Kharani]], and [[Makrani]]. The Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi are distinct dialects. The Kethran language in North East Balochistan is also a variant of Balochi. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan. Since [[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a poetic and rich language and have a certain degree of affinity to [[Urdu language|Urdu]], Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well as Ata Shaad, [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] and [[Noon Meem Danish]] are excellent examples of this.\n\n====Brahui====\n[[Brahui language|Brahui]] ({{lang-ur| \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u06cc  '}}) is a regional language of uncertain origin despite the fact that the bulk of the language shares lexical similarities to [[Balochi language|Balochi]] as well as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].

The [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with [[Urdu language|Urdu]] translation. The large numbers of Pakistanis living in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and in other Middle Eastern countries has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in Mosques, Schools, Colleges, Universities and [[Madrasah|Madrassahs]]. Nearly all of Pakistan's Muslim population has had some form of education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]].\n\nMany [[Arab people|Arabs]] who took part in [[Afghanistan]] war have now settled in [[Pakistan]] permanently with their families.

Usually concentrated in the heavily populated areas east of the [[Indus River|Indus river]], the Indo-Aryan languages and their cultures form the predominant cultural group in the country. They derive their roots from the [[Sanskrit]] language of Aryan invadors and are later heavily influenced by the languages of the later Muslim arrivals (i.e., Turkish, Persian, and Arabic), and are all written in a variant of either the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] or [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] script. Urdu, the country's national language, is an Indo-Aryan tongue. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]] and [[Seraiki language|Seraiki]], all [[mutually intelligible]], are classified by linguists as dialects of an Indo-Aryan speech called [[Lahnda languages|Lahnda]],<ref name=ethnologue2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90930|title=Browse by Language Family|work=Ethnologue}}</ref> also spelled as Lehnda. These are also, to a lesser extent, mutually intelligible with Urdu. Added together, speakers of these mutually-intelligible languages make up nearly two-thirds of Pakistan's population. [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is the common language of the people of [[Sindh]] in southern Pakistan and has a rich literary history of its own, traced back to the era of the early Arab arrivals. The Dardic languages of [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and the northwestern mountains are sometimes classified by many linguists as belonging to the Indo-Aryan family. Other Indo-Aryan languages include [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Memoni language|Memoni]] and others.\n\n=====Dardic languages=====\nThe [[Dardic languages]] are spoken in the northern Pakistan. They include [[Shina language|Shina]] (spoken in [[Gilgit]], [[Chilas]] and [[Diamer District|Diamar]]), [[Khowar language|Khowar]] (spoken in [[Chitral]], [[Ghizer]], [[Swat District|Swat]] and the balti language (spoken in [baltistan] including [skardu] district and [Ghanche] district.

Their ancestors came from Arabia and had settled in \u1e34h\u0332ur\u0101s\u0101n at the time of the Muslim conquest\u201d</ref> which came to power in Iran following the breakup of the [[Ilkhanate]] in the 14th century. At their zenith, they ruled a kingdom comprising [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]], Central Persia, and [[Persian Iraq]].\n\n==Rise to power==\n\nThe Muzaffarids were originally from [[Arabia]] and had settled in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from the beginning of [[Caliphate|Caliphal]] rule there. They stayed in Khorasan up until the [[Mongol]] invasion of that province, at which point they fled to [[Yazd]]. Serving under the Il-Khans, they gained prominence when Sharaf al-Din Muzaffar was made governor of [[Meybod|Maibud]]. He was tasked with crushing the robber-bands that were roaming around the country.\n\nSharaf al-Din's son, [[Mubariz al-Din Muhammad]], was brought up at the Il-Khan's court but returned to Maibud upon the death of the Il-Khan [[\u00d6ljeit\u00fc]]. In around 1319 he overthrew the [[atabeg]] of [[Yazd]] and was subsequently recognized as governor of the city by the central [[Il-Khan]] government. Following this he began fighting against the Neguderis, a Mongol tribal group. He managed to face this crisis with a minimum of loss.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn the wake of the loss of Il-Khan authority in central Iran following the death of [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)]], Mubariz al-Din continued to carry out his expansionary policy. In 1339 or 1340 he invaded the province of [[Kerm\u0101n Province|Kirman]] and seized it from its Mongol governor, Qutb al-Din b. Nasir. Kutb al-Din was able to retake the province for a short time after receiving aid from the [[Kartid]] dynasty of [[Herat]], but Mubariz al-Din permanently gained control of Kirman in late 1340. The city of [[Bam, Iran|Bam]] was besieged and conquered a few years after this.\n\nAfter the conquest of Kirman, Mubariz al-Din became a rival of the neighboring [[Injuids]], who controlled [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. Although the Muzaffarids and Injuids had traditionally been on friendly terms with one another, the Injuid [[Shah Sheykh Abu Esshagh|Abu Esshaq]]'s desire to gain Kirman led him to start a drawn-out conflict with the Muzaffarids in 1347. He unsuccessfully besieged Yazd (1350\u20131351), after which his fortunes declined rapidly. Defeated on the field in 1353, Abu Esshaq was forced to take refuge in Shiraz and finally surrender. He managed to escape from Shiraz and fled to Isfahan, but Mubariz al-Din pursued him, took the city and executed the Injuid ruler. Fars and western Iran were now under his control.\n\nWith the destruction of Injuid authority, the Muzaffarids were the strongest power in central Iran, and Shiraz was made their capital. Mubariz al-Din's strength was such that when the khan of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Jani Beg]], sent an offer to become his vassal, he was able to decline. In fact, he pushed on into Azerbaijan, which [[Jani Beg]] had conquered in 1357. He defeated the khan's governor Akhichuq and occupied [[Tabriz]], but realized that he could not hold his position against the [[Jalayirid]] troops marching from Baghdad and soon retreated. The Jalayirids would therefore maintain a hold on Tabriz, despite further attempts by the Muzaffarids to take it.\n\nMubariz al-Din was known as a cruel ruler, and soon afterwards 1358, his son [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] blinded and imprisoned him. A temporary reconciliation was reached, but it failed to last and he died, again in prison, in 1363.\n\n==Reign of Shah Shoja==\n[[File:Shah Shuja Shiraz2.JPG|thumb|250px|Tomb of [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]].]]\n\nShah Shoja proved to be a less of a tyrannic figure, but he was constantly fighting with his brothers, causing a long period of instability. In 1363 he marched against his first brother Shah Mahmud, who had been given control of Isfahan, although a peace was soon brokered. In the following year however, Shah Mahmud, with the support of his father-in-law Shaikh Uvais of the Jalayirids, invaded Fars and captured Shiraz. Shah Shoja would not be able to reconquer his capital until 1366. Shah Mahmud would continue to play and influential role in Iranian politics, using his marriage alliance to claim [[Tabriz]] from the Jalayirids after Shaikh Uvais died in 1374. He occupied the city but soon gave up after he was struck by illness. He died the next year, allowing Shah Shoja to occupy Isfahan.\n\nShah Shoja then marched on Tabriz himself, but was forced to turn back when internal conditions in Fars deteriorated. His second brother Shah Muzaffar's son, Shah Yahya, rose in revolt in Isfahan. Having to make peace with the Jalayirids, Shah Shoja offered to marry his son Zain Al-Abidin to a sister of the Jalayirid ruler Husain. The Jalayirids refused the offer and invaded, although Shah Shoja managed to prevent them from getting any further than [[Soltaniyeh|Sultaniyya]]. Before dying in 1384, he named his son Zain al-Abidin his successor and his third brother 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad as governor of Kirman. Not satisfied with the arrangement, Shah Yahya advanced against Shiraz, but was expelled from Isfahan by the city's populace and was forced to flee to Yazd. On his deathbed, Shah Shoja wrote a letter to [[Timur]], who was then campaigning in Azerbaijan, in which he gave his sons' loyalty to the conqueror.\n\n==Mozaffari decline==\n\nWhen Zain Al-Abidin succeeded his father, he quickly ignored the declaration of loyalty. Timur therefore marched into the Muzaffarid lands. He came to Isfahan, where the governor gave him control of the city, but a rebellion in the city killed any goodwill Timur had, resulting in a slaughter of the populace. Zain Al-Abidin fled from Shiraz in an attempt to make it to the Jalayirids in Baghdad, who were enemies of Timur. However, he encountered Shah Yahya's brother Shah Mansur, who imprisoned him. Shiraz soon fell to Timur. Shah Mansur and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad, along with other Muzaffarid princes, went to Shiraz to declare their loyalty, whereupon Timur restored them to their positions. The conqueror soon after returned to [[Transoxiana]]; Shiraz was given to Shah Yahya.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mozaffarids soon began to resume their local feuding. Shah Mansur began by expelling Shah Yahya from Shiraz, whereupon Shah Yahya again fled to Yazd. Shah Mansur then conquered [[Abarquh]], but failed to take Isfahan. Meanwhile, Zain al-Abidin escaped from prison and reached Isfahan. An alliance was then formed between Zain al-Abidin, Shah Yahya and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad against Shah Mansur. The alliance proved to be unstable, however, and when they met Shah Mansur's army at [[Furg Citadel|Furg]], Shah Yahya failed to show and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad quickly retreated. The latter met Shah Mansur again, this time at [[Fasa]], but lost and was captured in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]. He was blinded and imprisoned. Shah Mansur then approached Kirman, where Sultan Ahmad and Shah Yahya had gone after the events at Furg. He offered a common alliance against Timur, but was rebuffed and thereafter returned to Shiraz.\n\nTimur, who while campaigning elsewhere took note of these events, decided in 1392 that a campaign against Shah Mansur was in order. Shah Mansur gained the Sarbadar Muluk as his ally; Muluk was sent to defend [[Kashan]] and the Mozaffarid northern front. By March 1393 Timur had advanced down to Shushtar and Dizful, installing a Sarbadar as governor there. He also freed 'Imad-Din Ahmad from imprisonment. Shah Mansur fled Shiraz, but then turned around and met Timur's forces. With an army weakened by desertions, he fought bravely but was forced to retreat. Attempting to reach Shiraz, he was captured by forces of prince [[Shahrukh Mirza|Shah Rukh]] and was decapitated. The other Muzaffarid princes then again swore allegiance to Timur. They were received honorably by the conqueror, but on May 22 in Qumisha they were executed. Only Zain al-Abidin and Sultan Shibli (another son of Shah Shoja) survived the purge; they were sent to [[Samarkand]].\n\n==Muzaffarid rulers==\n\n* [[Mubariz al-Din Muhammad]] (1314\u20131358)\n* [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] (1358-1364)\n* [[Shah Mahmud (Muzaffarid)|Shah Mahmud]] (at Isfahan) (1364\u20131366)\n* [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] (1366-1384)\n* [[Zain al-Abidin (Muzaffarid)|Zain al-Abidin]] (1384\u20131387)\n* [[Shah Yahya]] (in [[Shiraz]], 1387-1391)\n* [[Sultan Ahmad (Muzaffarid)|Sultan Ahmad]] (in [[Kerman]], 1387-1391)\n* [[Sultan Abu Ishaq]] (in Sirajan, 1387-1391)\n* [[Shah Mansur (Persia)|Shah Mansur]] (1391-1393)\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of kings of Persia]]\n* [[Yazd]], a city dominated by the Mozaffarids\n* [[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n* [[Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*Jackson, Peter. \"Muzaffarids.\" '' Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume VII (Mif-Naz).''

A temporary reconciliation was reached, but it failed to last and he died, again in prison, in 1363.\n\n==Reign of Shah Shoja==\n[[File:Shah Shuja Shiraz2.JPG|thumb|250px|Tomb of [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]].]]\n\nShah Shoja proved to be a less of a tyrannic figure, but he was constantly fighting with his brothers, causing a long period of instability. In 1363 he marched against his first brother Shah Mahmud, who had been given control of Isfahan, although a peace was soon brokered. In the following year however, Shah Mahmud, with the support of his father-in-law Shaikh Uvais of the Jalayirids, invaded Fars and captured Shiraz. Shah Shoja would not be able to reconquer his capital until 1366. Shah Mahmud would continue to play and influential role in Iranian politics, using his marriage alliance to claim [[Tabriz]] from the Jalayirids after Shaikh Uvais died in 1374. He occupied the city but soon gave up after he was struck by illness. He died the next year, allowing Shah Shoja to occupy Isfahan.\n\nShah Shoja then marched on Tabriz himself, but was forced to turn back when internal conditions in Fars deteriorated. His second brother Shah Muzaffar's son, Shah Yahya, rose in revolt in Isfahan. Having to make peace with the Jalayirids, Shah Shoja offered to marry his son Zain Al-Abidin to a sister of the Jalayirid ruler Husain. The Jalayirids refused the offer and invaded, although Shah Shoja managed to prevent them from getting any further than [[Soltaniyeh|Sultaniyya]]. Before dying in 1384, he named his son Zain al-Abidin his successor and his third brother 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad as governor of Kirman. Not satisfied with the arrangement, Shah Yahya advanced against Shiraz, but was expelled from Isfahan by the city's populace and was forced to flee to Yazd. On his deathbed, Shah Shoja wrote a letter to [[Timur]], who was then campaigning in Azerbaijan, in which he gave his sons' loyalty to the conqueror.\n\n==Mozaffari decline==\n\nWhen Zain Al-Abidin succeeded his father, he quickly ignored the declaration of loyalty. Timur therefore marched into the Muzaffarid lands. He came to Isfahan, where the governor gave him control of the city, but a rebellion in the city killed any goodwill Timur had, resulting in a slaughter of the populace. Zain Al-Abidin fled from Shiraz in an attempt to make it to the Jalayirids in Baghdad, who were enemies of Timur. However, he encountered Shah Yahya's brother Shah Mansur, who imprisoned him. Shiraz soon fell to Timur. Shah Mansur and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad, along with other Muzaffarid princes, went to Shiraz to declare their loyalty, whereupon Timur restored them to their positions. The conqueror soon after returned to [[Transoxiana]]; Shiraz was given to Shah Yahya.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mozaffarids soon began to resume their local feuding. Shah Mansur began by expelling Shah Yahya from Shiraz, whereupon Shah Yahya again fled to Yazd. Shah Mansur then conquered [[Abarquh]], but failed to take Isfahan. Meanwhile, Zain al-Abidin escaped from prison and reached Isfahan. An alliance was then formed between Zain al-Abidin, Shah Yahya and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad against Shah Mansur. The alliance proved to be unstable, however, and when they met Shah Mansur's army at [[Furg Citadel|Furg]], Shah Yahya failed to show and 'Imad ad-Din Ahmad quickly retreated. The latter met Shah Mansur again, this time at [[Fasa]], but lost and was captured in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]. He was blinded and imprisoned. Shah Mansur then approached Kirman, where Sultan Ahmad and Shah Yahya had gone after the events at Furg. He offered a common alliance against Timur, but was rebuffed and thereafter returned to Shiraz.\n\nTimur, who while campaigning elsewhere took note of these events, decided in 1392 that a campaign against Shah Mansur was in order. Shah Mansur gained the Sarbadar Muluk as his ally; Muluk was sent to defend [[Kashan]] and the Mozaffarid northern front. By March 1393 Timur had advanced down to Shushtar and Dizful, installing a Sarbadar as governor there. He also freed 'Imad-Din Ahmad from imprisonment. Shah Mansur fled Shiraz, but then turned around and met Timur's forces. With an army weakened by desertions, he fought bravely but was forced to retreat. Attempting to reach Shiraz, he was captured by forces of prince [[Shahrukh Mirza|Shah Rukh]] and was decapitated. The other Muzaffarid princes then again swore allegiance to Timur. They were received honorably by the conqueror, but on May 22 in Qumisha they were executed. Only Zain al-Abidin and Sultan Shibli (another son of Shah Shoja) survived the purge; they were sent to [[Samarkand]].\n\n==Muzaffarid rulers==\n\n* [[Mubariz al-Din Muhammad]] (1314\u20131358)\n* [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] (1358-1364)\n* [[Shah Mahmud (Muzaffarid)|Shah Mahmud]] (at Isfahan) (1364\u20131366)\n* [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja]] (1366-1384)\n* [[Zain al-Abidin (Muzaffarid)|Zain al-Abidin]] (1384\u20131387)\n* [[Shah Yahya]] (in [[Shiraz]], 1387-1391)\n* [[Sultan Ahmad (Muzaffarid)|Sultan Ahmad]] (in [[Kerman]], 1387-1391)\n* [[Sultan Abu Ishaq]] (in Sirajan, 1387-1391)\n* [[Shah Mansur (Persia)|Shah Mansur]] (1391-1393)\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of kings of Persia]]\n* [[Yazd]], a city dominated by the Mozaffarids\n* [[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n* [[Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*Jackson, Peter. \"Muzaffarids.\" '' Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume VII (Mif-Naz).''

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|access-date=19 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207235556/http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|archive-date=7 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015952/http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher= Queen Online | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924084245/http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | archive-date= 24 September 2015 | url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor|website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119013417/http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|archive-date=19 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116181901/http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|archive-date=16 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work= The Daily Telegraph | date= 24 September 2011 | accessdate= 27 August 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924194628/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | archive-date= 24 September 2015 | url-status= live }}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225752/https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|archive-date=1 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton.

While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301230453/https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|archive-date=1 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301231110/https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|archive-date=1 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consists mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America but never was. The group, having seemingly given up on the UK market, only included tour dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not completely) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals, mainly by Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\"\u2014the B-side to \"Life Changes\", penned by Noone. ''Blue Rock'' was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was, however, immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 minutes) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718220555/http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen/ |archive-date=18 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608161809/http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |archive-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174809/http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''.

Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|access-date=19 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207235556/http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|archive-date=7 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015952/http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher= Queen Online | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924084245/http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | archive-date= 24 September 2015 | url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor|website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119013417/http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|archive-date=19 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116181901/http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|archive-date=16 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work= The Daily Telegraph | date= 24 September 2011 | accessdate= 27 August 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924194628/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | archive-date= 24 September 2015 | url-status= live }}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225752/https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|archive-date=1 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton.

The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News|date=17 November 2009|accessdate=1 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121113501/http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|archive-date=21 November 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release.

While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301230453/https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|archive-date=1 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301231110/https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|archive-date=1 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consists mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America but never was. The group, having seemingly given up on the UK market, only included tour dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not completely) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals, mainly by Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\"\u2014the B-side to \"Life Changes\", penned by Noone. ''Blue Rock'' was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was, however, immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 minutes) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718220555/http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen/ |archive-date=18 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608161809/http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |archive-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174809/http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''.

HarperCollins Publishers. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/potters field (accessed: December 24, 2014).</ref> referring to [[Akeldama]] (meaning ''field of blood'' in [[Aramaic]]), stated to have been purchased, with the coins that had been paid to [[Judas Iscariot]] for his identification of Jesus, after Judas' suicide, by the high priests of [[Jerusalem]]. The priests are stated to have acquired it for the burial of strangers, criminals, and the poor, the coins paid to Judas being considered blood money. Prior to Akeldama's use as a burial ground, it had been a site where potters collected high-quality, deeply red clay for the production of ceramics, thus the name potters' field.\n[[File:I come to claim my dead.jpg|thumb|\"I come to claim my dead\" drawing by [[William Thomas Smedley]], Circa 1884]]\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Akeldama}}\nThe term \"potter's field\" comes from [[Matthew 27:3]]\u2013[[Matthew 27:8|27:8]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]], in which Jewish priests take [[Thirty pieces of silver|30 pieces of silver]] returned by a remorseful [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]:\n\n{{quote|Then Judas, [[Kiss of Judas|who betrayed him]], seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients, saying: \"I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.\"  But they said: \"What is that to us?  Look thou to it.\"  And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himself with a halter.  But the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said: \"It is not lawful to put them into the [[mite box|corbona]], because it is the price of blood.\"  And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.  For this the field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day. \u2014 [[Douay-Rheims Bible]]}}\n\nThe site referred to in these verses is traditionally known as [[Akeldama]], in the [[Gehenna|valley of Hinnom]], which was a source of potters' clay. After the clay was removed, such a site would be left unusable for agriculture and thus might as well become a graveyard for those who could not be buried in an orthodox cemetery. This may be the origin of the name.<ref>R. T. France, ''The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary'', Eerdmans (1985), p. 386{{ISBN?}}</ref> A field where potters dug for clay would also be \"conveniently already full of trenches and holes.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.common-place-archives.org/vol-06/no-04/bahde/|title=The Common Dust of Potter\u2019s Field|first=Thomas|last=Bahde|date=30 December 2016|publisher=|volume=06|issue=04|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Common-Place}}</ref>\n\nThe author of Matthew was drawing on earlier Biblical references to potters' fields. The passage continues, with verses 9 and 10:\n\n{{quote|Then what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the amount the people of Israel had agreed to pay for him, and used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord had commanded me.\"}}\n\nThis is based on a quotation from [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] ({{Bibleref2|Zechariah 11:12\u201313}}). However, Matthew attributes the quote to Jeremiah. The author of Matthew may have been mistaken.  There are two other possible reasons for the reference.

The priests are stated to have acquired it for the burial of strangers, criminals, and the poor, the coins paid to Judas being considered blood money. Prior to Akeldama's use as a burial ground, it had been a site where potters collected high-quality, deeply red clay for the production of ceramics, thus the name potters' field.\n[[File:I come to claim my dead.jpg|thumb|\"I come to claim my dead\" drawing by [[William Thomas Smedley]], Circa 1884]]\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Akeldama}}\nThe term \"potter's field\" comes from [[Matthew 27:3]]\u2013[[Matthew 27:8|27:8]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]], in which Jewish priests take [[Thirty pieces of silver|30 pieces of silver]] returned by a remorseful [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]:\n\n{{quote|Then Judas, [[Kiss of Judas|who betrayed him]], seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients, saying: \"I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.\"  But they said: \"What is that to us?  Look thou to it.\"  And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himself with a halter.  But the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said: \"It is not lawful to put them into the [[mite box|corbona]], because it is the price of blood.\"  And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.  For this the field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this day. \u2014 [[Douay-Rheims Bible]]}}\n\nThe site referred to in these verses is traditionally known as [[Akeldama]], in the [[Gehenna|valley of Hinnom]], which was a source of potters' clay. After the clay was removed, such a site would be left unusable for agriculture and thus might as well become a graveyard for those who could not be buried in an orthodox cemetery. This may be the origin of the name.<ref>R. T.

The passage continues, with verses 9 and 10:\n\n{{quote|Then what the prophet Jeremiah had said came true: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the amount the people of Israel had agreed to pay for him, and used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord had commanded me.\"}}\n\nThis is based on a quotation from [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] ({{Bibleref2|Zechariah 11:12\u201313}}). However, Matthew attributes the quote to Jeremiah. The author of Matthew may have been mistaken.  There are two other possible reasons for the reference.  First, Jeremiah also speaks of buying a field, in {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah 32:6\u201315}}. That field is a symbol of hope, not despair as mentioned in Matthew, and the price is 17 pieces of silver. The author of Matthew could have combined the words of Zechariah and Jeremiah, while only citing the \"major\" prophet. Secondly, \"Jeremiah\" was sometimes used to refer to the Books of the Prophets ''in toto''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} as \"The Law\" is sometimes used to refer to Moses' five books &ndash; Genesis through Deuteronomy, the [[Pentateuch]].\n\n[[Craig Blomberg]] suggests that the use of the [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] to buy a burial ground for foreigners in [[Matthew 27:7]] may hint at the idea that \"Jesus' death makes salvation possible for all the peoples of the world, including the [[Gentiles]].\"<ref>[[Craig Blomberg|Craig L.
