As part of the compromise, the legislation prohibited slavery north of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]], excluding Missouri. The [[16th United States Congress]] passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President [[James Monroe]] signed it on March 6, 1820.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 125<br />Wilentz, 2004. p. 382</ref>\n\nEarlier, on February 1819, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]], a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republican]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood, which included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery, believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths rule]], which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a states' slave population. Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality\";<ref>Wilentz 2004. p. 387</ref> and \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\".<ref>Wilentz 2004 p. 389</ref>\n\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator [[Jesse B. Thomas]] of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36\u00b0 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]], in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the anti-restrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso, while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 25: \"[Henry Clay], who managed to bring up the separate parts of the compromise separately in the House, enabling the Old Republicans [in the South] to provide him with a margin of victory on the closely contested Missouri [statehood] bill while saved their pride by voting against the Thomas Proviso.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 381</ref> The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, the House sustaining its northern antislavery position, and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time, as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines. The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857). This increased tensions over slavery and eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Era of Good Feelings and party \"amalgamation\"==\n[[File: James Monroe 02.jpg|thumb|President James Monroe: signer of the Missouri Compromise bills<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 457-458</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Era of Good Feelings]], closely associated with the administration of President James Monroe (1817\u20131825), was characterized by the dissolution of national political identities.<ref>Ammon, 1958, p. 4: \"The phrase 'Era of Good Feelings', so inextricably associated with the administration of James Monroe ...</ref><ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23: \"So long as the Federalists remained an effective opposition, Jefferson's party worked as a party should. It maintained its identity in relation to the opposition by a moderate and pragmatic advocacy of strict construction of the Constitution. Because it had competition, it could maintain discipline. It responded to its constituent elements because it depended on them for support. But eventually, its very success was its undoing. After 1815, stirred by the nationalism of the postwar era, and with the Federals in decline, the Republicans took up Federalist positions on a number of the great public issues of the day, sweeping all before then as they did. The Federalists gave up the ghost. In the \"Era of Good Feelings\" that followed, everybody began to call himself a Republican, and a new theory of party amalgamation preached the doctrine that party division was bad and that a one-party system best served the national interest. Only gradually did it become apparent that in victory, the Republican's party had lost its identity, and it's usefulness. As the party of the whole nation, it ceased to be responsive to any particular elements in its constituency. It ceased to be responsive to the North ... When it did [become unresponsive], and because it did, it invited the Missouri crisis of 1819\u20131820 ...\"</ref> With the [[Hartford Convention|discredited]] Federalists in decline nationally, the \"amalgamated\" or hybridized Republicans adopted key Federalist economic programs and institutions, further erasing party identities and consolidating their victory.<ref>Ammon, 1958, p. 5: \"Most Republicans like former President [James] Madison readily acknowledged the shift that had taken place within the Republican party towards Federalist principles and viewed the process without qualms.

In that sense his worries proved to be warranted. The entire congressional debate of 1819\u20131820 over the Missouri Question turned on the question of federal versus state sovereignty, essentially a constitutional conflict in which Jefferson's long-standing opposition to federal power was clear and unequivocal, the Louisiana Purchase being the one exception that was now coming back to haunt him. But just as the constitutional character of the congressional debate served only to mask the deeper moral and ideological issues at stake, Jefferson's own sense of regret at his complicity in providing the constitutional precedent for the Tallmadge amendment merely scratched that surface of his despair.\"</ref>\n\nPrior to its purchase in 1803, the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region. In 1812, the state of Louisiana, a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase, had entered the Union as a slave state. Predictably, Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government.<ref>Malone, 1960. p. 419: \"[S]everal thousand planters took their slaves into the area believing that Congress would do nothing to disturb the institution, which had enjoyed legal protection in the territory of the Louisiana Purchase under its former French and Spanish rulers.\"</ref> In the years following the War of 1812, the region, now known as [[Missouri Territory]], experienced rapid settlement, led by slaveholding planters.<ref>Malone, 1969. p.419: \"After 1815, settlers had poured across the Mississippi ... Several thousand planters took their slaves in the area ...\"</ref>\n\nAgriculturally, the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River, from which that new state would be formed, had no prospects as a major cotton producer. Suited for diversified farming, the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture. On that basis, southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri, the slave population rising from 3,100 in 1810 to 10,000 in 1820. In a total population 67,000, slaves represented about 15 percent.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 109<br />Wilentz, 2004. P. 379: \"Missouri, unlike Louisiana, was not suited to cotton, but slavery had been established in the western portions, which were especially promising for growing hemp, a crop so taxing to cultivate that it was deemed fit only for slave labor. Southerners worried that a ban on slavery in Missouri, already home to 10,000 slaves \u2013 roughly fifteen percent of its total population [85% whites] \u2013 would create a precedent for doing so in all the entering states from the trans-Mississippi West, thereby establishing congressional powers that slaveholders denied existed</ref>\n\nBy 1818, the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood.

This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor. With this understanding, slaveholders had cooperated in authorizing the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787, and to outlawing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1808.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 22: \"The insistence that slavery was uniquely a Southern concern, not to be touched by outsiders, had been from the outset a sine qua non for Southern participation in national politics.

This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South, and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England, and more significantly, in the mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in the 1790s, with the introduction of the cotton gin, and by 1815, with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally, slave-based agriculture underwent an immense revival, spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River. Slavery opponents in the South vacillated, as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 383: \"Not since the framing and ratification of the Constitution in 1787\u201388 had slavery caused such a tempest in national politics. In part, the breakthrough of emancipation in the Middle States after 1789\u2014especially in New York, where James Tallmadge played a direct role\u2014emboldened Northern antislavery opinion. Southern slavery had spread since 1815. After the end of the War of 1812, and thanks to new demand from the Lancashire mills, the effects of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, and the new profitability of upland cotton, slavery expanded into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Between 1815 and 1820, U.S. cotton production doubled, and, between 1820 and 1825, it doubled again. Slavery's revival weakened what had been, during the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary era, a widespread assumption in the South, although not in South Carolina and Georgia, that slavery was doomed. By the early 1820s, Southern liberal blandishments of the post-Revolutionary years had either fallen on the defensive or disappeared entirely</ref>\n \nHowever rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slave-based society, they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution. The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders. Southern leaders \u2013 of whom virtually all identified as Jeffersonian Republicans \u2013 denied that Northerners had any business encroaching on matters related to slavery. Northern attacks on the institution were condemned as incitements to riot among the slave populations \u2013 deemed a dire threat to white southern security.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 22: \"... there ran one compelling idea that virtually united all Southerners, and which governed their participation in national politics.

Known as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]] or the \"federal ratio\", three-fifths (60%) of the slave population was numerically added to the free population. This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College. The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis, as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses, the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage. It is unlikely that the three-fifths clause, prior to 1820, was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery. Indeed, with the rising northern representation in the House, the South's share of the membership had declined since the 1790s.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 101: \"The three-fifths clause certainly inflated Southerner's power in the House, not simply in affecting numerous roll-call votes \u2013 roughly one in three overall of those recorded between 1795 to 1821 \u2013 but in shaping the politics of party caucuses ... patronage and judicial appointments. Yet even with the extra seats, the share held by major slaveholding states actually declined between 1790 to 1820, from 45% to 42% ...

The free states were now [1820] forging ahead in total population, were now had a definite majority. On the other hand, the delegation from the South was disproportionate to its free population, and the region actually had representation for its slave property.

In the 1819 15th Congress debates, he revived his critique as a complaint that New England and the Mid-Atlantic States suffered unduly from the federal ratio, declaring himself \"degraded\" (politically inferior) to the slaveholders. Federalists, North and South, preferred to mute antislavery rhetoric, but during the 1820 debates in the 16th Congress, King and other old Federalists would expand their critique to include moral considerations of slavery.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 385: \"More than thirty years after fighting the three-fifths clause at the Federal Convention, King warmly supported banning slavery in Missouri, restating the Yankee Federalist fear of Southern political dominance that had surfaced at the disgraced Hartford Convention in 1814. The issue, for King, at least in his early speeches on Missouri, was not chiefly moral. King explicitly abjured wanting to benefit either slaves or free blacks. His goal, rather, was to ward off the political subjugation of the older northeastern states\u2014and to protect what he called 'the common defense, the general welfare, and [the] wise administration of government.'

Blocked by Northern Republicans \u2013 largely on egalitarian grounds \u2013 with sectional support from Federalists, the bill would die in the upper house, where the federal ratio had no relevance. The \"balance of power\" between the sections, and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102-103: \"The three-fifths clause guaranteed the South a voting majority on some, but hardly all [critical matters] ... Indeed, the congressional bulwark of what became known, rightly, as the Slave Power proved not to be the House, but the Senate, where the three-fifths rule made no difference.\" And \"The three-fifths clause certainly did not prevent the House from voting to exclude slavery from the new state of Missouri in 1819. The House twice passed [in the 15th Congress] by substantial margins, antislavery resolutions proposed by [Tallmadge] with the largely Northern Republican majority founding its case on Jefferson's Declaration [of Independence] ...

So the South looked to preserve its sectional equality in the Senate.\"</ref>\n\n===\"Balance of Power\" in the Senate===\nNorthern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance. The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress. There, constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state, regardless of its population: the South, with its small white demographic relative to the North, benefited from this arrangement. Since 1815, sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions, leaving the North and South, at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood, at eleven states each.<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"[T]he North's demographic edge [in the House] did not translate into control over the federal government, for that edge was blunted by constitutional compromises.

The balance was deceptive. In 1818, when Illinois gained admission to the Union, antislavery forces won a state constitution that formally barred slavery but included a fierce legal code that regulated free blacks and permitted the election of two Southern-born senators.

The free inhabitants of Missouri, either in the territorial phase or during statehood, had the right to establish slavery \u2013 or disestablish it \u2013 exclusive of central government interference.

This would require halting the spread of slavery westward, and confine the institution to where it already existed. Faced with a population of 1.5 million slaves, and the lucrative production of cotton, the South would abandon hopes for containment. Slaveholders in the 16th Congress, in an effort to come to grips with this paradox, would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline: \"diffusion\".<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 268: \"Only a gradual policy of emancipation was feasible, but the mounting size of the slave population made any gradual policy unfeasible ... and made any southern-sponsored solution extremely unlikely ... the enlightened southern branch of the revolutionary generation ... had not kept its promise to [relinquish slavery].\" and p. 270: \"All [of the Revolutionary generation at the time] agreed that ending slavery depended on confining it to the South ... isolating it in the South.\"</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"...if slavery were confined to the states where it existed, the whites would eventually desert these regions ... would the [abandoned area] be accepted as black republics with representation in Congress? ... a common southern view [held] that the best way to ameliorate the lot of the slave and [achieving] emancipation, was by distributing slavery throughout the Union.\"</ref>\n\n==Stalemate==\nOn February 16, 1819, the House [[Committee of the Whole]] voted to link Tallmadge's provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation, approving the move 79\u201367.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 110</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379-380</ref> Following the committee vote, debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadge's provisions in the enabling act.

He suggested that Senator Rufus King's \"warm\" support for the Tallmadge amendment concealed a conspiracy to organize a new antislavery party in the North \u2013 a party composed of old Federalists in combination with disaffected antislavery Republicans. The fact that King, in the Senate, and Tallmadge and Tyler, in the House \u2013 all New Yorkers \u2013 were among the vanguard for slavery restriction in Missouri lent credibility to these charges. When King was re-elected to the US Senate in January 1820, during the 16th Congress debates, and with bipartisan support, suspicions deepened and would persist throughout the crisis.<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454: \"[President Monroe] and other Republicans were convinced that behind the attempt to exclude slavery from Missouri was a carefully concealed plot to revive the party divisions of the past either openly as Federalism or some new disguise.

[and that he] was in league with De Witt Clinton [who was pursuing his own presidential ambitions outside the Republican Party] ... to [Monroe's] way of thinking, the real objective of these leaders was power ... that they were willing to accept disunion if their plans could not be achieved in any other fashion ...

From then onward, the notion that a Federalist-Clintonian alliance was 'plotting' to build a new northern party out of the ruins of the Republican Ascendency was never absent from the Missouri debates.\"</ref> Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership, including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, considered it as an article of faith that Federalists, given the chance, would destabilize the Union so as to re-impose monarchal rule in North America, and \"consolidate\" political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government. Jefferson, at first unperturbed by the Missouri question, soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot, with Federalists and crypto-Federalists posing as Republicans, using Missouri statehood as a pretext.<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 270-271</ref>\n\nDue to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation, fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery: Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23</ref><ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 217: \"'Consolidation' was the new term that Jefferson embraced \u2013 other Virginians were using it too \u2013 to label the covert goals of these alleged conspirators.

[a] flawed explanation of ... the political forces that had mobilized around the Missouri Question [suspected of being organized] to maximize its coercive influence over popular opinion.\"</ref>\nThat the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable. There was no basis, however, for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures, nor was there anything to indicate that a New York-based King-Clinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party. The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a \"plot\" or that of \"consolidation\" as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis: the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles, not a Federalist resurgence.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 3885-386: \"No evidence exists to show that Clinton or any New England Federalist helped to instigate the Tallmadge amendments. Although most Northern Federalists backed restriction, they were hardly monolithic on the issue; indeed, in the first key vote on Tallmadge's amendments over Missouri, the proportion of Northern Republicans who backed restriction surpassed that of Northern Federalists. \"It is well known\", the New Hampshire Republican William Plumer, Jr. observed of the restrictionist effort, \"that it originated with Republicans, that it is supported by Republicans throughout the free states; and that the Federalists of the South are its warm opponents.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 122: \"There is no trace of a Federalist 'plot', at least as regards the origins of the Tallmadge amendment; there was never a Federalist-Clinton 'conspiracy' ...\"<br />Howe, 2004. p. 151</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454-455: \"Although there is nothing to suggest that the political aspirations of the Federalists were responsible for the move to restrict slavery in Missouri, once the controversy erupted for Federalists were not unwilling to consider the possibility of a new political alignment. They did not think in terms of a revival of Federalism, but rather of establishing a liaison with discontented Republicans which would offer them an opportunity to re-engage in political activity in some other form than a permanent minority.\" And p. 458: \"In placing this emphasis upon political implications of the conflict over Missouri [e.g. Federalist 'plots' and 'consolidation'], Monroe and other Southerners obscured the very real weight of antislavery sentiment involved in the restrictionist movement.\"</ref>\n\n==Development in Congress==\n[[File: Missouri Compromise Line.svg|thumb|400px|Extension of the [[Missouri Compromise Line]] westward was discussed by Congress during the [[Texas Annexation]] in 1845, during the [[Compromise of 1850]], and as part of the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] in 1860, but the line never reached the Pacific.]]\n\nTo balance the number of \"slave states\" and \"free states\", the northern region of what was then [[Massachusetts]], the [[District of Maine]], ultimately gained [[admission to the Union|admission into the United States]] as a free state to become [[Maine]].

The committee recommended the enactment of two laws, one for the admission of Maine, the other an [[enabling act]] for Missouri. They recommended against having restrictions on slavery but for including the Thomas amendment. Both houses agreed, and the measures were passed on March 5, 1820, and were signed by President [[James Monroe]] on March 6.\n\nThe question of the final admission of Missouri came up during the session of 1820\u20131821.  The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouri's new constitution (written in 1820) requiring the exclusion of \"free negroes and mulattoes\" from the state. Through the influence of [[Kentucky]] Senator [[Henry Clay]] \"The Great Compromiser\", an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen.

As part of the compromise, the legislation prohibited slavery north of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]], excluding Missouri. The [[16th United States Congress]] passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President [[James Monroe]] signed it on March 6, 1820.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 125<br />Wilentz, 2004. p. 382</ref>\n\nEarlier, on February 1819, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]], a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republican]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood, which included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill that imposed federal restrictions on slavery, believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths rule]], which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a states' slave population. Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality\";<ref>Wilentz 2004. p. 387</ref> and \"The Constitution [said northern Jeffersonians], strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\".<ref>Wilentz 2004 p. 389</ref>\n\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union as a slave state. Senator [[Jesse B. Thomas]] of Illinois added a compromise proviso that excluded slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36\u00b0 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]], in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the anti-restrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso, while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 25: \"[Henry Clay], who managed to bring up the separate parts of the compromise separately in the House, enabling the Old Republicans [in the South] to provide him with a margin of victory on the closely contested Missouri [statehood] bill while saved their pride by voting against the Thomas Proviso.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 381</ref> The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, the House sustaining its northern antislavery position, and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time, as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines. The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] effectively repealed the bill in 1854, and the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857). This increased tensions over slavery and eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Era of Good Feelings and party \"amalgamation\"==\n[[File: James Monroe 02.jpg|thumb|President James Monroe: signer of the Missouri Compromise bills<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 457-458</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Era of Good Feelings]], closely associated with the administration of President James Monroe (1817\u20131825), was characterized by the dissolution of national political identities.<ref>Ammon, 1958, p. 4: \"The phrase 'Era of Good Feelings', so inextricably associated with the administration of James Monroe ...</ref><ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23: \"So long as the Federalists remained an effective opposition, Jefferson's party worked as a party should. It maintained its identity in relation to the opposition by a moderate and pragmatic advocacy of strict construction of the Constitution. Because it had competition, it could maintain discipline. It responded to its constituent elements because it depended on them for support. But eventually, its very success was its undoing. After 1815, stirred by the nationalism of the postwar era, and with the Federals in decline, the Republicans took up Federalist positions on a number of the great public issues of the day, sweeping all before then as they did. The Federalists gave up the ghost. In the \"Era of Good Feelings\" that followed, everybody began to call himself a Republican, and a new theory of party amalgamation preached the doctrine that party division was bad and that a one-party system best served the national interest. Only gradually did it become apparent that in victory, the Republican's party had lost its identity, and it's usefulness. As the party of the whole nation, it ceased to be responsive to any particular elements in its constituency. It ceased to be responsive to the North ... When it did [become unresponsive], and because it did, it invited the Missouri crisis of 1819\u20131820 ...\"</ref> With the [[Hartford Convention|discredited]] Federalists in decline nationally, the \"amalgamated\" or hybridized Republicans adopted key Federalist economic programs and institutions, further erasing party identities and consolidating their victory.<ref>Ammon, 1958, p. 5: \"Most Republicans like former President [James] Madison readily acknowledged the shift that had taken place within the Republican party towards Federalist principles and viewed the process without qualms. And p. 4: \"... The Republicans had taken over (as they saw it) that which was of permanent value in the Federal program.\" And p. 10: \"... Federalists had vanished\" from national politics.</ref><ref>Brown, 1966, p. 23: \"... a new theory of party amalgamation preached the doctrine that party division was bad and that a one-party system best served the national interest\" and \"After 1815, stirred by the nationalism of the post-war era, and with the Federalists in decline, the Republicans took up the Federalist positions on a number of the great public issues of the day, sweeping all before them as they did. The Federalists gave up the ghost.\"</ref>\n  \nThe economic nationalism of the Era of Good Feelings that would authorize the [[Tariff of 1816]] and incorporate the [[Second Bank of the United States]] portended an abandonment of the Jeffersonian political formula for [[Strict constructionism|strict construction]] of the constitution, a limited central government and commitments to the primacy of Southern agrarian interests.<ref>Brown, 1966, p. 22: \"The insistence(FILL) ... outside the South\" and p. 23: The amalgamated Republicans, \"as a party of the whole nation ... ceased to be responsive to any particular elements in its constituency. It ceased to be responsive to the South.\" And \"The insistence that slavery was uniquely a Southern concern, not to be touched by outsiders, had been from the outset a sine qua non for Southern participation in national politics. It underlay the Constitution and its creation of a government of limited powers ...\"<br />Brown, 1966, p. 24: \"Not only did the Missouri crisis make these matters clear [the need to revive strict constructionist principles and quiet anti-slavery agitation], but \"it gave marked impetus to a reaction against nationalism and amalgamation of postwar Republicanism\" and the rise of the Old Republicans.</ref><ref>Ammon, 1971 (James Monroe bio) p. 463: \"The problems presented by the [consequences of promoting Federalist economic nationalism] gave an opportunity to the older, more conservative [Old] Republicans to reassert themselves by attributing the economic dislocation to a departure from the principles of the Jeffersonian era.\"</ref> The end of opposition parties also meant the end of party discipline and the means to suppress internecine factional animosities. Rather than produce political harmony, as President James Monroe had hoped, amalgamation had led to intense rivalries among Jeffersonian Republicans.<ref>Parsons, 2009, p. 56: \"Animosity between Federalists and Republicans had been replaced by animosity between Republicans themselves, often over the same issues that had once separated them from the Federalists.\"</ref>\n \nIt was amid the \"good feelings\" of this period \u2013 during which Republican Party discipline was in abeyance \u2013 that the [[Tallmadge Amendment]] surfaced.<ref>Brown, 1966, p.28: \"... amalgamation had destroyed the levers which made party discipline possible.\"</ref>\n\n==Louisiana Purchase and Missouri Territory==\nThe immense [[Louisiana Purchase]] territories had been acquired through federal executive action, followed by Republican legislative authorization in 1803 during the [[Thomas Jefferson]] administration.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 36<br />Ammons, 1971. p. 206<br />Ellis, 1996. p. 266: \"Jefferson had in fact worried out loud that the constitutional precedent he was setting with the acquisition of Louisiana in 1803. In that sense his worries proved to be warranted. The entire congressional debate of 1819\u20131820 over the Missouri Question turned on the question of federal versus state sovereignty, essentially a constitutional conflict in which Jefferson's long-standing opposition to federal power was clear and unequivocal, the Louisiana Purchase being the one exception that was now coming back to haunt him. But just as the constitutional character of the congressional debate served only to mask the deeper moral and ideological issues at stake, Jefferson's own sense of regret at his complicity in providing the constitutional precedent for the Tallmadge amendment merely scratched that surface of his despair.\"</ref>\n\nPrior to its purchase in 1803, the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region. In 1812, the state of Louisiana, a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase, had entered the Union as a slave state. Predictably, Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government.<ref>Malone, 1960. p. 419: \"[S]everal thousand planters took their slaves into the area believing that Congress would do nothing to disturb the institution, which had enjoyed legal protection in the territory of the Louisiana Purchase under its former French and Spanish rulers.\"</ref> In the years following the War of 1812, the region, now known as [[Missouri Territory]], experienced rapid settlement, led by slaveholding planters.<ref>Malone, 1969. p.419: \"After 1815, settlers had poured across the Mississippi ... Several thousand planters took their slaves in the area ...\"</ref>\n\nAgriculturally, the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River, from which that new state would be formed, had no prospects as a major cotton producer. Suited for diversified farming, the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture. On that basis, southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri, the slave population rising from 3,100 in 1810 to 10,000 in 1820. In a total population 67,000, slaves represented about 15 percent.<ref>Dangerfield, 1966. p. 109<br />Wilentz, 2004. P. 379: \"Missouri, unlike Louisiana, was not suited to cotton, but slavery had been established in the western portions, which were especially promising for growing hemp, a crop so taxing to cultivate that it was deemed fit only for slave labor. Southerners worried that a ban on slavery in Missouri, already home to 10,000 slaves \u2013 roughly fifteen percent of its total population [85% whites] \u2013 would create a precedent for doing so in all the entering states from the trans-Mississippi West, thereby establishing congressional powers that slaveholders denied existed</ref>\n\nBy 1818, the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood. An enabling act was provided to Congress empowering territorial residents to select convention delegates and draft a state constitution.<ref>Howe, 2004, p. 147: \"By 1819, enough settlers had crossed the Mississippi River that Missouri Territory could meet the usual population criterion for admission to the Union.\" And \"an 'enabling act' was presented to Congress [for Missouri statehood].\"<br />Malone, 1960. p. 419: \"[S]ettlement had reached the point where Missouri, the next state [after Louisiana state] to be carved out of the Louisiana Purchase, straddled the line between the free and slave states.\"</ref> The admission of Missouri territory as a slave state was expected to be more or less routine.<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 449: \"Certainly no one guessed in February 1819 the extent to which passions would be stirred by the introduction of a bill to permit Missouri to organize a state government.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"When the territorial residents of Missouri applied for admission to the Union, most Southerners\u2014and, probably, at first, most Northerners\u2014assumed slavery would be allowed. All were in for a shock.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 107: Prior to the Tallmadge debates, the 15th Congress there had been \"certain arguments or warnings concerning congressional powers in the territories; none the less ... [Tallmadge's amendment] caught the House off its guard.\"</ref>\n\n==Congress Debates: 1819==\n[[File: James Tallmadge portrait.jpg|thumb|Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]], author of the antislavery amendment to Missouri statehood]]\n\nWhen the Missouri statehood bill was opened for debate in the House of Representative on February 13, 1819, early exchanges on the floor proceeded without serious incident.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 106-107</ref> In the course of these proceedings, however, Representative [[James Tallmadge Jr.]] of New York \"tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings\" with the following amendments:<ref>Howe, 2004. p. 147</ref>\n\n{{quote|Provided, that the further introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude be prohibited, except for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been fully convicted; and that all children born within the said State will be executed after the admission thereof into the Union, shall be free at the age of twenty-five years.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 107</ref>}}\n\nA political outsider, the 41-year old Tallmadge conceived his amendment based on a personal aversion to slavery. He had played a leading role in accelerating emancipation of the remaining slaves in New York in 1817. Moreover, he had campaigned against Illinois' Black Codes: though ostensibly free-soil, the new Illinois state constitution permitted indentured servitude and a limited form of slavery.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965, p. 110: \"When Tallmadge, in 1818, attacked the indentured service and limited slavery provisions in the Illinois constitution, only thirty-four representatives voted with him against admission. The Tallmadge amendment of 1819, therefore, must also be considered the first serious challenge to the extension of slavery.</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 147: \"Tallmadge was an independent-minded Republican, allied at the time with Dewitt Clinton's faction in New York state politics. The year before, he had objected to the admission of Illinois on the (well-founded) grounds that its constitution did not provide enough assurance that the Northwest Ordinance prohibition on slavery would be perpetuated.\"<br />Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"In 1818, when Illinois gained admission to the Union, antislavery forces won a state constitution that formally barred slavery but included a fierce legal code that regulated free blacks and permitted the election of two Southern-born senators.\"</ref> As a New York Republican, Tallmadge maintained an uneasy association with Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]], a former Republican who depended on support from ex-Federalists. Clinton's faction was hostile to Tallmadge for his spirited defense of General [[Andrew Jackson]] over his contentious [[Seminole Wars#Jackson invades Florida|invasion]] of [[Florida]].<ref>Howe 2010</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 378: \"A Poughkeepsie lawyer and former secretary to Governor George Clinton, Tallmadge had served in Congress for just over two years when he made his brief but momentous appearance in national politics. He was known as a political odd duck. Nominally an ally and kin, by marriage, of De Witt Clinton, who nonetheless distrusted him, Tallmadge was disliked by the surviving New York Federalists, who detested his defense of General Andrew Jackson against attacks on Jackson's military command in East Florida.<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 107-108: \"James Tallmadge, Jr. a representative [of New York state] ... was supposed to be a member of the [DeWitt Clinton] faction in New York politics ... may have offered his amendment because his conscience was affronted, and for no other reason.</ref>\n \nAfter proposing the amendment, Tallmadge fell ill, Congressman [[John W. Taylor (politician)|John W. Taylor]], a fellow New York Republican, stepped in to fill the void. Taylor also had antislavery credentials, in February 1819, he had proposed a similar slave restriction for [[Arkansas Territory]] in the House (which was defeated 89\u201387).<ref>Dangerfield, 1965: p. 107, footnote 28: In February 1819,[Taylor, attempted] to insert into a bill establishing a Territory of Arkansas an antislavery clause similar to [the one Tallmadge would shortly present] ... and it \"was defeated in the House 89-87.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 122</ref> In a speech before the House during the debate on the Tallmadge Amendment, Taylor was highly critical of Southern lawmakers who frequently voiced their dismay that slavery was entrenched and necessary to their existence, and warned that Missouri's fate would \"decide the destiny of millions\" in future states in the [[Western United States|American West]].<ref name=AA1232019>{{cite web| last=Gooley| first=Lawrence P.| url=https://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2019/01/john-w-taylor-new-yorks-almost-only-speaker-of-the-house.html| title=John W.

Southern Jeffersonian united in almost unanimous opposition. The ensuing debates pitted the northern \"restrictionists\" (antislavery legislators who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories) and southern \"anti-restrictionists\" (proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting slavery expansion).<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p.380,386</ref> The sectional \"rupture\" over slavery among Jeffersonian Republicans, first exposed in the Missouri crisis, had its roots in the Revolutionary generation.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 376: \"Jeffersonian rupture over slavery drew upon ideas from the Revolutionary era. It began with congressional conflicts over slavery and related matter in the 1790s. It reached a crisis during the first great American debate about slavery in the nineteenth century, over the admission of Missouri to the Union.\"</ref>\n\nFive Congressmen in Maine were opposed to spreading slavery into new territories.

This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor. With this understanding, slaveholders had cooperated in authorizing the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787, and to outlawing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1808.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 22: \"The insistence that slavery was uniquely a Southern concern, not to be touched by outsiders, had been from the outset a sine qua non for Southern participation in national politics. It underlay the Constitution and its creation of a government of limited powers, without which Southern participation would have been unthinkable.\"</ref> Though the Founders sanctioned slavery, they did so with the implicit understanding that the slaveholding states would take steps to relinquish the institution as opportunities arose.<ref>Ellis, 1996. p. 267: \"[The Founders' silence on slavery] was contingent upon some discernible measure of progress toward ending slavery.\"</ref>\n \nSouthern states, after the [[American Revolutionary War|War for Independence]], had regarded slavery as an institution in decline (with the exception of Georgia and South Carolina). This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South, and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England, and more significantly, in the mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in the 1790s, with the introduction of the cotton gin, and by 1815, with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally, slave-based agriculture underwent an immense revival, spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River. Slavery opponents in the South vacillated, as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 383: \"Not since the framing and ratification of the Constitution in 1787\u201388 had slavery caused such a tempest in national politics. In part, the breakthrough of emancipation in the Middle States after 1789\u2014especially in New York, where James Tallmadge played a direct role\u2014emboldened Northern antislavery opinion. Southern slavery had spread since 1815. After the end of the War of 1812, and thanks to new demand from the Lancashire mills, the effects of Eli Whitney's cotton gin, and the new profitability of upland cotton, slavery expanded into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Between 1815 and 1820, U.S. cotton production doubled, and, between 1820 and 1825, it doubled again. Slavery's revival weakened what had been, during the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary era, a widespread assumption in the South, although not in South Carolina and Georgia, that slavery was doomed. By the early 1820s, Southern liberal blandishments of the post-Revolutionary years had either fallen on the defensive or disappeared entirely</ref>\n \nHowever rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slave-based society, they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution. The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders. Southern leaders \u2013 of whom virtually all identified as Jeffersonian Republicans \u2013 denied that Northerners had any business encroaching on matters related to slavery. Northern attacks on the institution were condemned as incitements to riot among the slave populations \u2013 deemed a dire threat to white southern security.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 22: \"... there ran one compelling idea that virtually united all Southerners, and which governed their participation in national politics. This was that the institution of slavery should not be dealt with from outside the South. Whatever the merits of the institution \u2013 and Southerners violently disagreed about this, never more so than in the 1820s \u2013 the presence of the slave was a fact too critical, too sensitive, too perilous to be dealt with by those not directly affected.

Tallmadge's amendments horrified Southern congressmen, the vast majority of whom were Jeffersonian Republicans.

Southerners of all factions and both parties rallied to the proposition that slavery must remain a Southern question.</ref>\n\nNorthern Jeffersonian Republicans embraced the Jeffersonian antislavery legacy during the Missouri debates, explicitly citing the Declaration of Independence as an argument against expanding the institution.

Known as the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]] or the \"federal ratio\", three-fifths (60%) of the slave population was numerically added to the free population. This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College. The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis, as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses, the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage. It is unlikely that the three-fifths clause, prior to 1820, was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery. Indeed, with the rising northern representation in the House, the South's share of the membership had declined since the 1790s.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 101: \"The three-fifths clause certainly inflated Southerner's power in the House, not simply in affecting numerous roll-call votes \u2013 roughly one in three overall of those recorded between 1795 to 1821 \u2013 but in shaping the politics of party caucuses ... patronage and judicial appointments. Yet even with the extra seats, the share held by major slaveholding states actually declined between 1790 to 1820, from 45% to 42% ... [and] none of the bills listed in the study concerned slavery, whereas in 1819, antislavery Northerners, most of them Jeffersonian Republicans, rallied a clear House majority to halt slavery's expansion.\"</ref><ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"The three-fifths clause inflated the South's representation in the House. Because the number of presidential electors assigned to each state was equal to the size of its congressional delegation ... the South had power over the election of presidents that was disproportionate to the size of the region's free population ... since Jefferson's accession in 1801, a \"Virginia Dynasty\" had ruled the White House.\"<br />Malone, 1960. p. ?: \"The constitutional provision relating to slavery that bore most directly on the [Missouri controversy] was the three-fifths ratio of representation, sometimes called the federal ratio. The representation of any state in the lower house of Congress was based on the number of its free inhabitants, push three-fifths of its slaves. The free states were now [1820] forging ahead in total population, were now had a definite majority. On the other hand, the delegation from the South was disproportionate to its free population, and the region actually had representation for its slave property. This situation vexed the Northerners, especially the New Englanders, who had suffered from political frustration since the Louisiana Purchase, and who especially resented the rule of the Virginia Dynasty.\"<br />Wilentz, 2016. p. 47: \"[Federalists] objected above all to the increasingly notorious three-fifths clause [which] inflated representation of the Southern states in Congress and the Electoral College\"</ref>\n\nHostility to the federal ratio had historically been the object of the now nationally ineffectual Federalists; they blamed their collective decline on the \"[[Virginia dynasty|Virginia Dynasty]]\", expressed in partisan terms rather than in moral condemnation of slavery. The pro-De Witt Clinton-Federalist faction carried on the tradition, posing as antirestrictionists, for the purpose of advancing their fortunes in New York politics.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 99: \"[Federalist hostility to Jefferson and the Virginia Dynasty] nothing about slavery or its cruelties showed up \u2013 except (in what had become a familiar sour-grapes excuse among Federalists for their national political failures) how the three-fifths clause aided the wretched ... Jeffersonians.\"</ref><ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 109: \"The federal ratio ... had hitherto been an object of the Federalist-Clintonian concern [rather than the Northern Jeffersonian Republicans]; whether the Republicans of the North and East would have gone to battle over Missouri is their hands had not been forced by Tallmadge's amendment is quite another question.\"<br />Howe, 2004, p. 150<br />Brown, 1966. p. 26</ref>\n\nSenator [[Rufus King]] of New York, a Clinton associate, was the last Federalist icon still active on the national stage, a fact irksome to Southern Republicans.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 385</ref> A signatory to the US Constitution, he had strongly opposed the three-fifths rule in 1787. In the 1819 15th Congress debates, he revived his critique as a complaint that New England and the Mid-Atlantic States suffered unduly from the federal ratio, declaring himself \"degraded\" (politically inferior) to the slaveholders. Federalists, North and South, preferred to mute antislavery rhetoric, but during the 1820 debates in the 16th Congress, King and other old Federalists would expand their critique to include moral considerations of slavery.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 385: \"More than thirty years after fighting the three-fifths clause at the Federal Convention, King warmly supported banning slavery in Missouri, restating the Yankee Federalist fear of Southern political dominance that had surfaced at the disgraced Hartford Convention in 1814. The issue, for King, at least in his early speeches on Missouri, was not chiefly moral. King explicitly abjured wanting to benefit either slaves or free blacks. His goal, rather, was to ward off the political subjugation of the older northeastern states\u2014and to protect what he called 'the common defense, the general welfare, and [the] wise administration of government.' Only later did King and other Federalists begin pursuing broader moral and constitutional indictments of slavery.</ref><ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 121, footnote 64</ref>\n\nRepublican James Tallmadge, Jr. and the Missouri restrictionists deplored the three-fifths clause because it had translated into political supremacy for the South. They had no agenda to remove it from the founding document, only to prevent its further application west of the Mississippi River.<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 39: \"... they were openly resentful of the fact that the three-fifths clause had translated into political supremacy for the South.<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 109: \"[The federal ratio] hardly agreed with [the restrictionists] various interests for this apportionment to move across the Mississippi River. Tallmadge [remarked the trans-Mississippi region] 'had no claim to such unequal representation, unjust upon the other States.\"</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 150: \"The Missouri Compromise also concerned political power ... many [Northerners] were increasingly alarmed at the disproportionate political influence of the southern slaveholders ... [resenting the three-fifths clause].\"</ref>\n\nAs determined as Southern Republicans were to secure Missouri statehood with slavery, the three-fifths clause failed to provide the margin of victory in the 15th Congress. Blocked by Northern Republicans \u2013 largely on egalitarian grounds \u2013 with sectional support from Federalists, the bill would die in the upper house, where the federal ratio had no relevance. The \"balance of power\" between the sections, and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate.<ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102-103: \"The three-fifths clause guaranteed the South a voting majority on some, but hardly all [critical matters] ... Indeed, the congressional bulwark of what became known, rightly, as the Slave Power proved not to be the House, but the Senate, where the three-fifths rule made no difference.\" And \"The three-fifths clause certainly did not prevent the House from voting to exclude slavery from the new state of Missouri in 1819. The House twice passed [in the 15th Congress] by substantial margins, antislavery resolutions proposed by [Tallmadge] with the largely Northern Republican majority founding its case on Jefferson's Declaration [of Independence] ... The antislavery effort would die in the Senate, where, again, the three-fifths clause made no difference.\"</ref><ref>Howe, 2004. p. 150: \"...but if slavery were on the road to ultimate extinction in Missouri, the state might not vote with the proslavery bloc. In such power calculations, the composition of the Senate was of even greater moment than that of the House ... So the South looked to preserve its sectional equality in the Senate.\"</ref>\n\n===\"Balance of Power\" in the Senate===\nNorthern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance. The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress. There, constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state, regardless of its population: the South, with its small white demographic relative to the North, benefited from this arrangement. Since 1815, sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions, leaving the North and South, at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood, at eleven states each.<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"[T]he North's demographic edge [in the House] did not translate into control over the federal government, for that edge was blunted by constitutional compromises. The fact that the Founders had decided that each state, however large or small, would elect two senators meant the South's power in the Senate was disproportionate to its population, and that maintaining a senatorial parity between North and South depended on bringing in equal numbers of free and slave states.<br />Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"The central concern in the debates ... had been over the [senatorial] balance of power, for the Southern congressmen had concentrated their objections upon the fact that the admission of Missouri would forever destroy the equal balance then existing between [the number of] free and slave states.\"</ref>\n\nThe South, voting as a bloc on measures that challenged slaveholding interests and augmented by defections from Free State Senators with Southern sympathies, was able to tally majorities. The Senate stood as the bulwark and source of the [[Slave Power]] \u2013 a power that required admission of slave states to the Union to preserve its national primacy.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379: \"At stake were the terms of admission to the Union of the newest state, Missouri. The main issue seemed simple enough, but the ramifications were not. Since 1815, in a flurry of state admissions, the numbers of new slave and free states had been equal, leaving the balance of slave and free states nationwide and in the Senate equal. The balance was deceptive. In 1818, when Illinois gained admission to the Union, antislavery forces won a state constitution that formally barred slavery but included a fierce legal code that regulated free blacks and permitted the election of two Southern-born senators. In practical terms, were Missouri admitted as a slave state, the Southern bloc in the Senate might enjoy a four-vote, not a two-vote majority.<br />Howe, 2004. p. 150</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2016. p. 102: \"The congressional bulwark of what came to be known, rightly, as the [[Slave Power]] proved not to be the House but the Senate ...\"</ref>\n\nMissouri statehood, with the Tallmadge amendment approved, would set a trajectory towards a Free State trans-Mississippi and a decline in Southern political authority. The question as to whether the Congress could lawfully restrain the growth of slavery in Missouri took on great importance among the slave states. The moral dimensions of the expansion of human bondage would be raised by Northern Republicans on constitutional grounds.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 114-115: \"The political and sectional problem originally raised by the Tallmadge amendment, the problem of the control of the Mississippi Valley, quite failed to conceal [the] profound renumciation of human rights.\"</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 387: \"According to the Republicans, preservation of individual rights and strict construction of the Constitution demanded the limitation of slavery and the recognition ...

Representative John W. Taylor pointed to Indiana and Illinois, where their Free State status conformed to the antislavery provisions in the [[Northwest Ordinance]].\n<ref>Varon, 2008. p. 40: \"Tallmadge [and his supporters] made the case that it was constitutional for Congress to legislate the end of slavery in Missouri after its admission to statehood [to determine] the details of its government.\"<br />Wilentz, 2005. p. 123</ref>\n\n[[File:Timothy Fuller.jpg|thumb|Massachusetts Representative Timothy Fuller]]\n\nFurther, antislavery legislators invoked [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article Four, Section Four]] of the Constitution, which required that states provide a republican form of government. As the [[Louisiana Territory]] was not part of the United States in 1787, they argued, introducing slavery into Missouri would thwart the egalitarian intent of the Founders.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 387: \"According to the Republicans, preservation of individual rights and strict construction of the Constitution demanded the limitation of slavery and the recognition, in Fuller's words, that \"all men have equal rights\", regardless of color.

The free inhabitants of Missouri, either in the territorial phase or during statehood, had the right to establish slavery \u2013 or disestablish it \u2013 exclusive of central government interference. As to the Northwest Ordinance, Southerners denied that this could serve as a lawful antecedent for the territories of the Louisiana Purchase, as the ordinance had been issued originally under the [[Articles of Confederation]], not under the US Constitution.<ref name=\"Varon, 2008. p. 40\">Varon, 2008. p. 40</ref>\n\nAs a legal precedent, they offered the treaty acquiring the Louisiana lands in 1803: the document included a provision (Article 3) that extended the rights of US citizens to all inhabitants of the new territory, including the protection of property in slaves.<ref name=\"Varon, 2008. p. 40\"/> When slaveholders embraced Jeffersonian constitutional strictures on a limited central government they were reminded that Jefferson, as US President in 1803, had deviated from these precepts when he wielded federal executive power to double the size the United States (including the lands under consideration for Missouri statehood). In doing so, he set a Constitutional precedent that would serve to rationalize Tallmadge's federally imposed slavery restrictions.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p, 379: footnote (8)<br />Ellis, 1995. p.266</ref>\n\nThe 15th Congress debates, focusing as it did on constitutional questions, largely avoided the moral dimensions raised by the topic of slavery. That the unmentionable subject had been raised publicly was deeply offensive to Southern Congressmen, and violated the long-held sectional understanding between free and slave state legislators.<ref>Ellis, 1995. p.266-267: \"[W]hat most rankled Jefferson [and southern Republicans] about the debate over the Missouri Question was that it was happening at all.

This would require halting the spread of slavery westward, and confine the institution to where it already existed. Faced with a population of 1.5 million slaves, and the lucrative production of cotton, the South would abandon hopes for containment. Slaveholders in the 16th Congress, in an effort to come to grips with this paradox, would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline: \"diffusion\".<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 268: \"Only a gradual policy of emancipation was feasible, but the mounting size of the slave population made any gradual policy unfeasible ... and made any southern-sponsored solution extremely unlikely ... the enlightened southern branch of the revolutionary generation ... had not kept its promise to [relinquish slavery].\" and p. 270: \"All [of the Revolutionary generation at the time] agreed that ending slavery depended on confining it to the South ... isolating it in the South.\"</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 450: \"...if slavery were confined to the states where it existed, the whites would eventually desert these regions ... would the [abandoned area] be accepted as black republics with representation in Congress? ... a common southern view [held] that the best way to ameliorate the lot of the slave and [achieving] emancipation, was by distributing slavery throughout the Union.\"</ref>\n\n==Stalemate==\nOn February 16, 1819, the House [[Committee of the Whole]] voted to link Tallmadge's provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation, approving the move 79-67.<ref>Dangerfield, 1965. p. 110</ref><ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 379-380</ref> Following the committee vote, debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadge's provisions in the enabling act.

The fact that King, in the Senate, and Tallmadge and Tyler, in the House \u2013 all New Yorkers \u2013 were among the vanguard for slavery restriction in Missouri lent credibility to these charges. When King was re-elected to the US Senate in January 1820, during the 16th Congress debates, and with bipartisan support, suspicions deepened and would persist throughout the crisis.<ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454: \"[President Monroe] and other Republicans were convinced that behind the attempt to exclude slavery from Missouri was a carefully concealed plot to revive the party divisions of the past either openly as Federalism or some new disguise.

[and that he] was in league with De Witt Clinton [who was pursuing his own presidential ambitions outside the Republican Party] ... to [Monroe's] way of thinking, the real objective of these leaders was power ... that they were willing to accept disunion if their plans could not be achieved in any other fashion ... [and that] Tallmadge was one of Clinton's close associates [added weight to his suspicions] ...

New York, he hinted, was the center of this conspiracy; and he barely concealed his belief that Rufus King and [Governor] De Witt Clinton \u2013 a Federalist and (many believed) a crypto-Federalist \u2013 were its leaders.\" And \"In 1819 [King had expressed himself] with ... too great a warmth in favor of the Tallmadge amendment, and in January 1820, he was re-elected to the by a legislative composed [of both New York factions] ... From then onward, the notion that a Federalist-Clintonian alliance was 'plotting' to build a new northern party out of the ruins of the Republican Ascendency was never absent from the Missouri debates.\"</ref> Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership, including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, considered it as an article of faith that Federalists, given the chance, would destabilize the Union so as to re-impose monarchal rule in North America, and \"consolidate\" political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government. Jefferson, at first unperturbed by the Missouri question, soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot, with Federalists and crypto-Federalists posing as Republicans, using Missouri statehood as a pretext.<ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 270-271</ref>\n\nDue to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation, fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery: Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed.<ref>Brown, 1966. p. 23</ref><ref>Ellis, 1995. p. 217: \"'Consolidation' was the new term that Jefferson embraced \u2013 other Virginians were using it too \u2013 to label the covert goals of these alleged conspirators. In one sense the consolidations were simply the old monarchists in slightly different guise ... [a] flawed explanation of ... the political forces that had mobilized around the Missouri Question [suspected of being organized] to maximize its coercive influence over popular opinion.\"</ref>\nThat the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable. There was no basis, however, for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures, nor was there anything to indicate that a New York-based King-Clinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party. The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a \"plot\" or that of \"consolidation\" as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis: the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles, not a Federalist resurgence.<ref>Wilentz, 2004. p. 3885-386: \"No evidence exists to show that Clinton or any New England Federalist helped to instigate the Tallmadge amendments. Although most Northern Federalists backed restriction, they were hardly monolithic on the issue; indeed, in the first key vote on Tallmadge's amendments over Missouri, the proportion of Northern Republicans who backed restriction surpassed that of Northern Federalists. \"It is well known\", the New Hampshire Republican William Plumer, Jr. observed of the restrictionist effort, \"that it originated with Republicans, that it is supported by Republicans throughout the free states; and that the Federalists of the South are its warm opponents.\"<br />Dangerfield, 1965. p. 122: \"There is no trace of a Federalist 'plot', at least as regards the origins of the Tallmadge amendment; there was never a Federalist-Clinton 'conspiracy' ...\"<br />Howe, 2004. p. 151</ref><ref>Ammons, 1971. p. 454-455: \"Although there is nothing to suggest that the political aspirations of the Federalists were responsible for the move to restrict slavery in Missouri, once the controversy erupted for Federalists were not unwilling to consider the possibility of a new political alignment. They did not think in terms of a revival of Federalism, but rather of establishing a liaison with discontented Republicans which would offer them an opportunity to re-engage in political activity in some other form than a permanent minority.\" And p. 458: \"In placing this emphasis upon political implications of the conflict over Missouri [e.g. Federalist 'plots' and 'consolidation'], Monroe and other Southerners obscured the very real weight of antislavery sentiment involved in the restrictionist movement.\"</ref>\n\n==Development in Congress==\n[[File: Missouri Compromise Line.svg|thumb|400px|Extension of the [[Missouri Compromise Line]] westward was discussed by Congress during the [[Texas Annexation]] in 1845, during the [[Compromise of 1850]], and as part of the proposed [[Crittenden Compromise]] in 1860, but the line never reached the Pacific.]]\n\nTo balance the number of \"slave states\" and \"free states\", the northern region of what was then [[Massachusetts]], the [[District of Maine]], ultimately gained [[admission to the Union|admission into the United States]] as a free state to become [[Maine]]. This only occurred as a result of a compromise involving slavery in Missouri, and in the federal territories of the American West.<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] p. 184</ref>\nThe admission of another slave state would increase the South's power at a time when northern politicians had already begun to regret the Constitution's [[Three-Fifths Compromise]]. Although more than 60 percent of [[White Americans|whites]] in the United States lived in the North, by 1818 northern representatives held only a slim majority of congressional seats. The additional political representation allotted to the South as a result of the Three-Fifths Compromise gave southerners more seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] than they would have had if the number was based on just free population. Moreover, since each state had two Senate seats, Missouri's admission as a slave state would result in more southern than northern senators.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom On My Mind: A History of African Americans|last = White|first = Deborah Gray|publisher = Bedford/St. Martin's|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = 215}}</ref> A bill to enable the people of the [[Missouri Territory]] to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary to admission into the Union came before the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in [[Committee of the Whole]], on February 13, 1819. [[James Tallmadge]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] offered an amendment, named the [[Tallmadge Amendment]], that forbade further introduction of slaves into Missouri, and mandated that all children of slave parents born in the state after its admission should be free at the age of 25. The committee adopted the measure and incorporated it into the bill as finally passed on February 17, 1819, by the house. The [[United States Senate]] refused to concur with the amendment, and the whole measure was lost.<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] pp. 49\u201351</ref><ref>[[#Forbes|Forbes, 1899]] pp. 36\u201338</ref>\n\nDuring the following session (1819\u20131820), the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January 26, 1820, by [[John W. Taylor (politician)|John W. Taylor]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state. The question had been complicated by the admission in December of [[Alabama]], a [[slave state]], making the number of slave and free states equal.  In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit [[Maine]] as a [[free state (United States)|free state]].<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nThe Senate decided to connect the two measures.  It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of [[Jesse B. Thomas]] of [[Illinois]], excluding slavery from the [[Louisiana Territory]] north of the [[parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north]] (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri.<ref name=Greeley>Greeley, Horace.

The amendment and the bill passed in the Senate on February 17 and February 18, 1820.  The House then approved the Senate compromise amendment,  on a vote of 90 to 87, with those 87 votes coming from free state representatives opposed to slavery in the new state of Missouri.<ref name=Greeley />  The House then approved the whole bill, 134 to 42, with opposition from the southern states.<ref name=Greeley/>\n\n===Second Missouri Compromise===\nThe two houses were at odds not only on the issue of the legality of slavery but also on the [[Parliamentary procedure|parliamentary question]] of the inclusion of Maine and Missouri within the same bill. The committee recommended the enactment of two laws, one for the admission of Maine, the other an [[enabling act]] for Missouri. They recommended against having restrictions on slavery but for including the Thomas amendment. Both houses agreed, and the measures were passed on March 5, 1820, and were signed by President [[James Monroe]] on March 6.\n\nThe question of the final admission of Missouri came up during the session of 1820\u20131821.  The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouri's new constitution (written in 1820) requiring the exclusion of \"free negroes and mulattoes\" from the state. Through the influence of [[Kentucky]] Senator [[Henry Clay]] \"The Great Compromiser\", an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen. This deliberately ambiguous provision is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise.<ref>[[#Dixon|Dixon, 1899]] pp. 116\u2013117</ref>\n\n==Impact on political discourse==\nDuring the decades following 1820, Americans hailed the 1820 agreement as an essential compromise almost on the sacred level of the Constitution itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Millard Fillmore: The 13th President, 1850\u20131853|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ueWiEBrTq4C&pg=PA39|year=2011|publisher=Henry Holt |page=39}}</ref> Although the Civil War broke out in 1861, historians often say the Compromise helped postpone the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA340|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=340}}</ref>\n\n[[File: US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|300px|Animation showing the free/slave status of U.S. states and territories, 1789\u20131861, including the Missouri Compromise]]\n\nThese disputes involved the competition between the southern and northern states for power in Congress and for control over future territories.  There were also the same factions emerging as the [[Democratic-Republican party]] began to lose its coherence. In an April 22 letter to [[John Holmes (U.S. politician)|John Holmes]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that the division of the country created by the [[Missouri Compromise Line|Compromise Line]] would eventually lead to the destruction of the Union:<ref>[[#Brown|Brown, 1964]] p.69</ref>\n\n{{quote|... but this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. it is hushed indeed for the moment. but this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence.

To admit Missouri as a slave state would tip the balance in the Senate (made up of two senators per state) in favor of the slave states. For this reason, northern states wanted Maine admitted as a free state. Maine was admitted in 1820<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar15.html | publisher=Library of Congress  | title=Maine Becomes a State | date=March 15, 1820 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> and Missouri in 1821,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/aug10.html | publisher=Library of Congress  | title=Missouri Becomes a State |date=August 10, 1821 | accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref> but no further states were added until 1836, when Arkansas was admitted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun15.html | publisher=Library of Congress | title=Arkansas Becomes a State | accessdate=2012-11-18}}\n</ref>\n\nFrom the [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] standpoint, the Compromise of 1820 was important as the example of Congressional exclusion of slavery from U.S. territory acquired since the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. Nevertheless, the Compromise was deeply disappointing to African-Americans in both the North and South, as it stopped the southern progression of gradual emancipation at Missouri's southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom On My Mind: A History of African Americans|last = White|first = Deborah Gray|publisher = Bedford/St. Martin's|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = 215\u2013216}}</ref>\n\n==Repeal==\nThe provisions of the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in the former [[Louisiana Territory]] north of the [[parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north]] were effectively repealed by [[Stephen A.

Nikon Instruments is a specialist in optical instrumentation and the only [[microscope]] company to manufacture its own glass.\n\n==History==\nThe company, Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics'), was formed in 1917 with the merger of three Japanese optical manufacturers to produce precision optical glass. In 1925, the brand expanded to produce the first microscope with a revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives \u2013 the Joico microscope. Over the next few decades the [[microscopy]] division introduced new polarising and stereomicroscopes, and metrology products for measuring and inspection.\n \nNikon launched the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes in the 1970s and established the CF Optical system. In the 1980s, they released 80 new products, including the inverted Diaphot microscope, which was used in [[IVF]] techniques. The introduction of the Eclipse range of infinity optics in the 1990s was a departure from traditional microscope design. CFI60 optics have high numerical apertures (N.A.s) and long working distances, increased resolution and light-gathering capability and high performance in confocal imaging. The infinity optical system also has the benefit that the distance between the objective and the eyepiece tube is not fixed, allowing a variety of imaging modules to be inserted into the light path without any compromise in optical quality.  This has allowed microscopes to be used as versatile imaging workstations that provide users with instant access to several imaging methods. Using a Nikon Diaphot microscope, in 1996, [[Dolly the sheep]] was the first mammal to be successfully [[cloned]] from an adult cell.

He was, among other things, the home of [[Union 92 Berlin]], the German Football Champion of 1905, as well as venue of a football [[International sport|international]] s between [[German national football team|Germany]] and [[England national amateur football team|England (Am.)]]. Today, the [[Blue-White 90 Berlin (1992) | Blue-White 90 Berlin]] and the [[1. Traber FC Mariendorf]] are located on the square.\n\n== History ==\nThe \"Berlin Thor and Football Club Union\", founded in 1892, initially played like many other [[Berlin]] football clubs on the [[Tempelhof Field # Sport History | Tempelhofer Feld]]. After the local football fields had proved at the beginning of the 20th century as outdated, founded Union 92 a construction company, the swampy and undeveloped terrain on the [[List of streets and squares in Berlin-Mariendorf # Rathausstra.C3.9Fe .2A | Rathausstra\u00dfe]] in the then still independent rural community Mariendorf. There had originally been a lake, which had been filled during the construction of the [[Teltowkanal]].\n\nIn 1908, a new football field was completed on the site. At the opening on October 4, 1908, Union 92 met [[Wacker Leipzig]]. In 1909 a wooden grandstand was built. With a capacity of about 10,000 spectators, the Union Square before the [[World War I]] was one of the largest sports facilities in the Berlin area. In the 1920s, the increase in standing room walls increased the capacity to around 14,000 visitors.\n\nIn the summer of 1927, Union 92 merged with another traditional Berlin club, the [[BFC Vorw\u00e4rts 1890]] to the [[Blau-Wei\u00df 90 Berlin | Sporting Association Blue-White 1890]]. Union Square became the home of Blue-White 90 and has since been called 'Blue and White Square'. The wooden seating tribune burned down in the night of 4 to 5 October 1936 and was not reconstructed.\nIn [[World War II]] the square served as a collection point for seized private vehicles. From 1945 could be played on the square again football matches. Erstligafu\u00dfball was played on the Blue-White-Platz last in the [[Bundesliga league 1959/60, as blue-white 90 belonged to the contract league Berlin. In 1966 Blau-Weiss moved to the Friedrich Ebert Stadium in Berlin Tempelhof and in 1968 the club had to sell its old sports ground to the city of Berlin for financial reasons. In the aftermath of the audience walls were removed.\n\nAfter Blue-White 90, which had played since 1984 in [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)| Berlin Olympic Stadium]], went bankrupt in 1992, took the successor club SV Blue White Berlin (now again '' Blue-White 90 Berlin '') the game mode back on the old blue and white square. Overall, the blue and white square today has only a capacity of a few hundred spectators. To the south of the main course, which is equipped with natural grass, there are still artificial turf pitches.

It was among the largest Danish resistance groups and consisted of around 350 volunteers towards the end of the war.

By this time of the occupation, resistance work carried a great deal of risk because the general public was still largely opposed to sabotage{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} and the government was following its [[Occupation of Denmark#Protectorate Government 1940\u201343|\"co-operation\" policy with the Nazis]] to keep German intervention in Danish affairs to a minimum. Holger Danske, as well as the rest of the Danish resistance, was very much opposed to this collaboration and continued to believe that the Danes should have resisted the invasion much more fiercely. [[Gunnar Dyrberg]] recalls in his memoir how he had seen Danes engage in friendly conversation with the Germans immediately after the invasion and cites this as one of the reasons he later decided to join Holger Danske, with the code name Bob Herman. A fuller account of his activities as a liquidator are described in his autobiographical book ''De ensomme Ulve'' (The Lonely Wolves).\n\nThe group was infiltrated by the [[Gestapo]] twice but because of its loose structure (unlike [[BOPA]]) they were unable to identify all the members. A total of 64 members were executed by the Gestapo during the occupation.\n\nAmong their largest sabotage actions were the blowing up of the [[Forum Arena]] in 1943 and the attack on [[Burmeister & Wain]] in 1944.\n\nTwo of the members of Holger Danske were [[J\u00f8rgen Haagen Schmith]] and [[Bent Faurschou-Hviid]], who became famous under their aliases, Citronen (the Lemon) and Flammen (the Flame). Both led numerous sabotage operations in 1943 and 1944. They were portrayed in the 2008 movie ''[[Flammen og Citronen]]'' by [[Thure Lindhardt]] and [[Mads Mikkelsen]].\n\nOne member of the group, [[Lis Mellemgaard]], survived the war as she remained at home with a sore throat when her colleagues were rounded up and executed in March 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesblaabog.dk/Default.aspx?pageid=17531|title=Lis Mellemgaard|publisher=Kvindernes Bl\u00e5 Bog|accessdate=13 December 2016|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926080550/http://www.kvindernesblaabog.dk/Default.aspx?pageid=17531|archive-date=26 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{in lang|da}} ''Holger Danske Vaagner'', Josef Petersen and \"Bob\" Jarset, Copenhagen, 1946\n* {{in lang|da}} [http://www.besaettelse-befrielse.dk/leksikon_h.html#Holger_Danske Danmark under bes\u00e6ttelsen og befrielsen]\n* {{in lang|da}} ''De illegale: To Holger Danske sabot\u00f8rer fort\u00e6ller'', Bob Herman, 1985, {{ISBN|87-7466-080-2}}\n* {{in lang|da}} ''En dreng alt vel fra Dannebrogsgade 60 til Nobel\u2019s Explosive no. 808 - fra en Holger Danske sabot\u00f8rs dagbog'', Gunnar Dyrberg, 2006, {{ISBN|87-91660-12-2}}\n* {{in lang|da}} ''De ensomme Ulve'', Gunnar Dyrberg, Gyldendal Copenhagen 2009, 208 pp, {{ISBN|978-87-02-07404-8}}\n* {{in lang|da}} ''Gem\u00fcse fort\u00e6ller.

His then-unconventional music was at odds with that of his Danish contemporaries but was recognized 16&nbsp;years after his death.\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in [[Copenhagen]], Rued Langgaard was the only son of composer and Royal Chamber musician Siegfried Langgaard (1852\u20131914) and Emma Langgaard (n\u00e9e Foss, 1861\u20131926), both of whom were pianists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/long-bio/rued-langgaard/|title=Rued Langgaard - Long Biography - Music Sales Classical|website=www.musicsalesclassical.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref> At the age of five Rued began taking [[piano]] lessons with his mother, and later with his father and a private teacher. His talent emerged quickly, and at seven he was able to play [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'' and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[mazurka]]s. By then he had begun to compose short pieces for the piano and play the [[organ (music)|organ]]. At 10 he began to study the organ under [[Gustav Helsted]], organist at the [[Jesus Church, Valby|Jesuskirken in Valby]], and the [[violin]] under Chr. Petersen, formerly of the Royal Orchestra.\n\nAt the age of 11 he made his first public appearance as an organist and improviser on the organ at a concert at the [[Frederick's Church|Frederikskirken]] (Marmorkirken) in Copenhagen. When he was 12, he started to study [[music theory]] under [[C. F. E. Horneman]] and, later, Vilhelm Rosenberg.\n\nLanggaard's first compositions, 2 piano pieces and 2 songs, were published when he was 13, and around that time he was taught [[counterpoint]] by the celebrated composer [[Carl Nielsen]] for about a month. A year later, his choral work ''Musae triumphantes'' was performed at a concert in Copenhagen, marking his public debut as a composer. During his teen years he continued composing and travelled with his parents around Christmas and New Year's Eve, meeting conductors [[Arthur Nikisch]] and [[Max Fiedler]].\n\nAt 18, Langgaard served as assistant organist at the Frederikskirken (Marmorkirken) in Copenhagen. The following year (1913) his ''Symphony No. 1 \"Mountain Pastorals\"'' received its first performance at a concert in Berlin with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] under the baton of Max Fiedler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/introducing-your-next-great-musical-discovery-rued-langgaard|title=Introducing your next great musical discovery: Rued Langgaard|last=Mellor|first=Andrew|date=2014-09-25|website=www.gramophone.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref>\n\nHis father died in 1914, and from 1915 to 1917 he was assistant organist at the Garnisons Kirke in Copenhagen. From 1917 onward he applied without success for the post of organist at a large number of churches in Copenhagen. In 1922 a young woman named Valborg Constance Olivia Tetens (she was known as Constance) moved in with Rued Langgaard and his mother in Copenhagen. A year after his mother died in 1926, Langgaard married Constance Tetens.\n\nAlthough Langgaard was given a state grant from the age of 30, his works and job applications were almost continually rejected by the establishment. Only at the age of 46 did he manage to obtain a permanent job, as the organist at the [[Ribe Cathedral|cathedral]] in [[Ribe]], the oldest town in Denmark, situated in southwest [[Jutland]]. Just shy of his 59th birthday, Rued Langgaard died in Ribe, still unrecognized as a composer.\n\n== Music ==\n[[File:Rued+Langgaard.jpg|thumb|Langgaard in later life]]\nRued Langgaard composed in a late Romantic style, emphatically dramatic and endowed with colossal mood swings. Unquestionably, he was influenced by [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] and, like Strauss, he was a master of [[orchestration]]. He was a prolific composer for the large orchestra, writing 16 symphonies as well as other orchestral works.\n\n[[Music of the Spheres (Langgaard)|''Music of the Spheres'']] is his best-known and most radical work. It is a symphonic work of great complexity, calling for a large orchestra, organ and choir, a supporting (distant) orchestra including a soprano voice, and a further piano on which the strings are played directly rather than via the keys. It was composed during [[World War I]], but only performed twice (in Germany in 1921\u20131922) during Langgaard's lifetime and lay dormant for almost 50&nbsp;years before being rediscovered. When it was rediscovered in the late 1960s, it was considered remarkably modern and reflective of the pathfinding style in which Langgaard composed. In 2010 ''Music of the Spheres'' received its British premiere at [[The Proms]], conducted by [[Thomas Dausgaard]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/proms/7927866/RuedLanggaard-return-of-a-visionary-composer.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ivan | last=Hewett | title=Rued Langgaard: return of a visionary composer | date=5 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nHis unorthodox style and sense of drama extended to the titles of his compositions. His fourth and sixth symphonies are known as the ''Leaf Fall'' and ''Heaven Storming''. His symphonies Nos. 13 and 16 are named ''Faithlessness'' and ''Deluge of Sun'', respectively.

{"title_page": "Anarchist criminology", "text_new": "{{Criminology and penology}}\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n'''Anarchist criminology''' is a school of thought in [[criminology]] that draws on influences and insights from [[anarchist]] theory and practice. Building on insights from anarchist theorists including [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]], anarchist criminologists' approach to the [[causes of crime]] emphasises what they argue are the harmful effects of the [[state (polity)|state]]. Anarchist criminologists, a number of whom have produced work in the field since the 1970s, have critiqued the political underpinnings of criminology and emphasised the political significance of forms of crime not ordinarily considered to be political. Anarchists propose the [[abolition of the state]]; accordingly, anarchist criminologists tend to argue in favour of forms of non-state justice. The principles and arguments of anarchist criminology share certain features with those of [[Marxist criminology]], [[critical criminology]] and other schools of thought within the discipline, while also differing in certain respects.\n\n==Background and precursors==\n[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that law was the cause of criminality and that crime would cease following the abolition of private property and existing legal structures.]]\n[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], here depicted by [[Gustave Courbet]], is considered a precursor of anarchist criminology.]]\n[[Anarchism]] is not a single [[ideology]] but rather a tradition that encompasses a variety of belief systems and practices, united by a belief that the [[state (polity)|state]] is coercive, exploitative, and destructive, and by advocacy on behalf of non-hierarchical organisational forms and [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=8}} Anarchism is [[anti-authoritarian]]: whereas ideologies such as [[Marxism]] and [[feminism]] oppose particular forms of power, anarchists oppose power as such, including [[capitalism]], the state, [[organised religion]] and [[patriarchy]], which they see as interwoven with one another.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|pp=161\u20132}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=160}}{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=42}} Accordingly, anarchism questions the [[conventional wisdom]] produced by these forms of power, including ideas about [[universality (philosophy)|universality]], and pursues [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity in the [[epistemic]] and [[aesthetic]] domains.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|pp=161\u20132}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=162}} \"Anarchy\", for anarchists, means a society without rulers, but not one without order.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371}}\n\nThe roots of anarchist criminology lie in the critiques of law and legality formulated by [[classical anarchists]] including [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Alexander Berkman]] [[Emma Goldman]], [[William Godwin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Max Stirner]], each of whom envisioned forms of [[social order]] that would, in the absence of the state, maximise individual freedom and encourage [[self-organisation]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=8}}{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Nocella|2015|p=44}}{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Kropotkin developed an expansive account of the [[sociology of law]], in which he argued that aspects of existing legal structures serve primarily to protect the wealthy or to protect the state, and was among the first criminologists to examine crime's social causes.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Kropotkin argued that law, especially law protecting [[private property]] and the state, was to blame for sustaining criminality and generating [[social pathologies]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}} Rather than preventing crime, Kropotkin argued that [[punishment]] only brings out the worst in people and enhances the power of the state over people's lives.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}} Kropotkin thought that most crime would vanish following the abolition of private property and the replacement of profit and [[competition (economics)|competition]] by cooperation and human need as society's guiding principles.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}} In this framework, alternative notions of [[social justice]] and alternative forms of [[solidarity]] would supersede existing structures of criminal justice and the [[rule of law]] as tools for mitigating [[anti-social behaviour]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}}\n\nJeff Shantz and Dana M. Williams argue that \"grappling with an anarchist criminology means engaging more directly and more fully with the history of anarchist writings on crime and social order\",{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|p=73}} and that Proudhon's work in particular anticipates the insights of [[left realist]] criminology, while also transcending it by maintaining a critical attitude toward state power.{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|p=70}} Shantz and Williams argue that Proudhon's thought is \"an antidote to the authoritarian, mythic conceptions of justice presented by [[social contract theory]] and mainstream criminology but also the limited and constrained notions of justice posited by statist [[critical theory]] and socialism\"{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|pp=71\u20132}} and a precursor to [[peacemaking criminology]] and theories of restorative justice.{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|pp=94\u20135}}\n\nThe anarchist criminologist Jeff Ferrell also identifies the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) as a precursor of anarchist criminology: in the United States in the early 20th century the IWW identified \"[[law and order (politics)|law and order]]\" as a form of power instantiated by the ruling class at the expense of the working class, and developed the tactic of the \"on the job strike\", in which workers stringently obey rules and regulations in order to slow work.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Ferrell argues that criminologists can draw on the anarchist tradition in order to oppose \"an increasingly authoritarian social order\".{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=161}} Within this framework, anarchist perspectives aid in understanding forms of both authority and resistance.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=161}}\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Causes of crime===\n\nAnarchist criminologists hold that crime is caused by structures of oppression and domination.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371}} Accordingly, their priority is often to critique these structures, with the goal of replacing them, rather than to develop detailed analyses of how they cause crime.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371}}\n\nAnarchist criminologists have theorised the law as a \"state [[protection racket]]\", arguing that phenomena such as [[speed trap]]s and [[seizure (law)|seizure]] laws are similarly backed by the threat of violence.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|pp=43\u20134}} They argue that these and similar phenomena are a feature of all legal systems\u2014found in democracies as much as in dictatorships\u2014and that their ubiquity indicates that law does not protect from harm, but is itself a form of harm.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=44}}\n\nAnarchist criminologists also emphasise the \"definitional\" role of criminal justice systems, through which such systems are empowered to define certain behaviours as criminal, and argue that many acts considered criminal are only deemed so because they are associated with less powerful social groups or with efforts to dislodge existing power structures.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=44}}\n\nFerrell argues that anarchist criminology is a critique of the way that human relationships become submerged in, and immobilised by, structures of legal authority.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=162}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=187}} Anarchist criminology contends that law solidifies and reproduces existing structures of power, thereby placing limitations on possible social relations and exacerbating crime and violence.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=42}}\n\n===Approach to the discipline===\n\nAnarchist criminology argues that the state is not politically neutral, and that criminology cannot be neutral either. Within this framework, anarchist criminologists argue that while much criminology takes the side of the powerful, other traditions in criminology side with the oppressed and exploited.{{sfn|Nocella|Seis|Shantz|2018|p=2}}\n\nAnarchist criminologists argue that state law and [[criminalisation]] are inherently political, so acts of crime are by extension always imbued with political significance.{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=17}} As such, anarchist criminology calls for close attention to be paid to criminal (or criminalised) behaviour such as [[graffiti]] writing, \"[[obscene]]\" artistic and musical performances, [[pirate radio]] broadcasts, illegal [[strike action|strikes]], [[shoplifting]], drug use and [[hacker|hacking]],{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|pp=17\u201318}} and finds forms of political resistance in behaviours and lifestyles commonly considered criminal.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|pp=196\u20137}}\n\nFerrell describes anarchist criminology as invested in a process of demystification through which the [[epistemologies]] of certainty, truth and justice that are used to justify authority are called into question.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|pp=189\u201390}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=165}} Ferrell expresses hope that this process of \"dismantling\" the mythologies surrounding the law will \"contribute to a more general disrespect for law and authority\" by calling law's legitimacy into question.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrell|1996|p=191|ps=. See also {{harvtxt|Ferrell|1994|pp=165\u20136}}.}}</ref>\n\nFerrell argues that instead of adhering to a single masterplan, anarchist criminology is characterised by a \"spirit of eclectic inclusivity\" and an embrace of \"fluid communities of uncertainty and critique.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=18}} He also proposes that anarchist criminological orientations \"can serve not as some rigid corrective, nor competing paradigm, but as analytic sparks within an already lively alternative criminology.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=161}} Ferrell argues that anarchist criminology does not purport \"to incorporate reasoned or reasonable critiques of law and legal authority,\" but rather argues that social change requires \"unreasonable\" approaches.{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=11}} \n\n===Practical implications===\n\nAnarchist criminologists propose the replacement of existing legal systems with [[decentralised]], negotiated, [[participatory justice]].{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=372}} Such a system would, it is thought, encourage individuals to accept responsibility for their behaviour by reminding them of their connections to others in society.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=372}} Anarchist criminology argues that if law must exist, its function must be transformed so that instead of protecting private property, [[social privilege]] and state power, it would ensure tolerance and diversity.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=187}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|pp=162\u20133}} Anarchist criminology tends to favour holistic [[transformative justice]] approaches over [[restorative justice]], which it tends to argue is too beholden to the existing criminal justice system.{{sfn|Nocella|Seis|Shantz|2018|p=3}}\n\nMany anarchist criminologists endorse [[prison abolition]], arguing that prisons encourage [[recidivism]] and should be replaced by efforts to [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] offenders and reintegrate them into communities.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=45}} Ferrell argues that anarchist criminology must oppose [[moral entrepreneur]]s and associated \"[[war as metaphor|wars]]\" (the [[War on Drugs]], [[War on Gangs]], etc.), which he argues \"operate as well-planned exercises in victimization and blame, deflecting the public gaze from those in authority and toward those least able to resist it.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=192}} Declaring \"war\" in this way, Ferrell argues, \"exacerbates and perpetuates the very problems it claims to address\" and leads to heightened violence.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=44}}\n\n==Relation to other schools of criminological thought==\n\nThe core principles of anarchist criminology are linked to those of [[abolitionism (criminology)|abolitionism]], [[critical race theory]], [[left realism]], [[peacemaking criminology]] and [[restorative justice]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371, 376}} Anarchist criminology also informs [[new criminology]], [[labeling theory]], [[postmodern criminology]] and [[cultural criminology]].{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=46}} [[Stuart Henry (criminologist)|Stuart Henry]] and Scott A. Lukas argue that anarchist criminology is related to [[constitutive criminology]], cultural criminology, left realism and critical race theory, all of which they argue represent divergences from a single perspective but which also have in common the themes of peacemaking criminology and restorative justice.{{sfn|Henry|Lukas|2009|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxv}} Peacemaking criminology, which argues that violent responses to social problems result in further violence and seeks to develop ways to transform violent relationships into safe and respectful relationships, also emerged from work in anarchist criminology.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|pp=45\u20136}} Ferrell also identifies anarchist criminology as a type of [[newsmaking criminology]].{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=191}}\n\nAnarchist criminology shares with [[postmodern criminology]] the belief that domination can work through structures of information and knowledge.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=372}} It also shares with [[Marxist criminology]] the view that crime has its origins in an unjust social order and that a radical transformation of society is desirable.{{sfn|Ugwudike|2015|p=94}} Unlike Marxists, however, who propose that [[capitalism]] be replaced with [[socialism]], anarchists reject all hierarchical or authoritarian structures of power.{{sfn|Ugwudike|2015|p=94}} Anarchist criminology is associated with [[critical criminology]], though Anthony J. Nocella II argues that differences between the two schools reflect divergences between [[anarchism and Marxism]]: anarchist criminology foregrounds [[anti-authoritarianism]], while critical criminology shares with Marxism a willingness to accept authority when exercised by the [[proletariat]].{{sfn|Nocella|2015|p=44}} While many critical criminologists argue that state law in many cases reproduces [[economic inequality]], [[patriarchy]] and [[racism]], anarchist criminologists go further by arguing that state law is inherently harmful to people and society even when it is not overtly discriminatory.{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=15}}\n\nIn his case study of [[graffiti writing]], Ferrell argues that anarchist criminology must combine aspects of [[interactionism]] and political or economic criminology, as \"we cannot understand the nature of crime without understanding both its immediate construction out of social interaction and its larger construction through processes of political and economic authority.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=188}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=163}} Ferrell proposes that this entails \"that anarchist criminologists must look up and down at the same time&mdash;that is, must pay attention to the subtleties of legal and political authority, the nuances of lived criminal events, and the interconnections between the two.\"<ref name=seealso>{{harvnb|Ferrell|1996|p=189|ps=. See also {{harvtxt|Ferrell|1994|pp=164\u20135}}}}</ref> However, while anarchist criminologists \"look up\" disrespectfully at hierarchical and authoritarian power structures, they \"look down and around at the lived experience of criminality ... respectfully&mdash;not with respect for any and all criminal acts, but for the possibilities of meaning that are embedded in them.\"<ref name=seealso/>\n\nFerrell also writes: <blockquote>Anarchist criminology certainly incorporates the sort of \"visceral revolt\" that characterizes anarchism itself, the passionate sense of \"fuck authority,\" to quote the old anarchist slogan, the comes from being shoved around by police officers, judges, bosses, priests, and other authorities one time too many.

Building on insights from anarchist theorists including [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]], anarchist criminologists' approach to the [[causes of crime]] emphasises what they argue are the harmful effects of the [[state (polity)|state]]. Anarchist criminologists, a number of whom have produced work in the field since the 1970s, have critiqued the political underpinnings of criminology and emphasised the political significance of forms of crime not ordinarily considered to be political. Anarchists propose the [[abolition of the state]]; accordingly, anarchist criminologists tend to argue in favour of forms of non-state justice. The principles and arguments of anarchist criminology share certain features with those of [[Marxist criminology]], [[critical criminology]] and other schools of thought within the discipline, while also differing in certain respects.\n\n==Background and precursors==\n[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that law was the cause of criminality and that crime would cease following the abolition of private property and existing legal structures.]]\n[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], here depicted by [[Gustave Courbet]], is considered a precursor of anarchist criminology.]]\n[[Anarchism]] is not a single [[ideology]] but rather a tradition that encompasses a variety of belief systems and practices, united by a belief that the [[state (polity)|state]] is coercive, exploitative, and destructive, and by advocacy on behalf of non-hierarchical organisational forms and [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=8}} Anarchism is [[anti-authoritarian]]: whereas ideologies such as [[Marxism]] and [[feminism]] oppose particular forms of power, anarchists oppose power as such, including [[capitalism]], the state, [[organised religion]] and [[patriarchy]], which they see as interwoven with one another.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|pp=161\u20132}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=160}}{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=42}} Accordingly, anarchism questions the [[conventional wisdom]] produced by these forms of power, including ideas about [[universality (philosophy)|universality]], and pursues [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity in the [[epistemic]] and [[aesthetic]] domains.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|pp=161\u20132}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=162}} \"Anarchy\", for anarchists, means a society without rulers, but not one without order.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371}}\n\nThe roots of anarchist criminology lie in the critiques of law and legality formulated by [[classical anarchists]] including [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Alexander Berkman]] [[Emma Goldman]], [[William Godwin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Max Stirner]], each of whom envisioned forms of [[social order]] that would, in the absence of the state, maximise individual freedom and encourage [[self-organisation]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=8}}{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Nocella|2015|p=44}}{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Kropotkin developed an expansive account of the [[sociology of law]], in which he argued that aspects of existing legal structures serve primarily to protect the wealthy or to protect the state, and was among the first criminologists to examine crime's social causes.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Kropotkin argued that law, especially law protecting [[private property]] and the state, was to blame for sustaining criminality and generating [[social pathologies]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}} Rather than preventing crime, Kropotkin argued that [[punishment]] only brings out the worst in people and enhances the power of the state over people's lives.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}} Kropotkin thought that most crime would vanish following the abolition of private property and the replacement of profit and [[competition (economics)|competition]] by cooperation and human need as society's guiding principles.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}} In this framework, alternative notions of [[social justice]] and alternative forms of [[solidarity]] would supersede existing structures of criminal justice and the [[rule of law]] as tools for mitigating [[anti-social behaviour]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}}\n\nJeff Shantz and Dana M. Williams argue that \"grappling with an anarchist criminology means engaging more directly and more fully with the history of anarchist writings on crime and social order\",{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|p=73}} and that Proudhon's work in particular anticipates the insights of [[left realist]] criminology, while also transcending it by maintaining a critical attitude toward state power.{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|p=70}} Shantz and Williams argue that Proudhon's thought is \"an antidote to the authoritarian, mythic conceptions of justice presented by [[social contract theory]] and mainstream criminology but also the limited and constrained notions of justice posited by statist [[critical theory]] and socialism\"{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|pp=71\u20132}} and a precursor to [[peacemaking criminology]] and theories of restorative justice.{{sfn|Shantz|Williams|2013|pp=94\u20135}}\n\nThe anarchist criminologist Jeff Ferrell also identifies the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) as a precursor of anarchist criminology: in the United States in the early 20th century the IWW identified \"[[law and order (politics)|law and order]]\" as a form of power instantiated by the ruling class at the expense of the working class, and developed the tactic of the \"on the job strike\", in which workers stringently obey rules and regulations in order to slow work.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Ferrell argues that criminologists can draw on the anarchist tradition in order to oppose \"an increasingly authoritarian social order\".{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=161}} Within this framework, anarchist perspectives aid in understanding forms of both authority and resistance.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=161}}\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Causes of crime===\n\nAnarchist criminologists hold that crime is caused by structures of oppression and domination.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371}} Accordingly, their priority is often to critique these structures, with the goal of replacing them, rather than to develop detailed analyses of how they cause crime.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371}}\n\nAnarchist criminologists have theorised the law as a \"state [[protection racket]]\", arguing that phenomena such as [[speed trap]]s and [[seizure (law)|seizure]] laws are similarly backed by the threat of violence.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|pp=43\u20134}} They argue that these and similar phenomena are a feature of all legal systems\u2014found in democracies as much as in dictatorships\u2014and that their ubiquity indicates that law does not protect from harm, but is itself a form of harm.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=44}}\n\nAnarchist criminologists also emphasise the \"definitional\" role of criminal justice systems, through which such systems are empowered to define certain behaviours as criminal, and argue that many acts considered criminal are only deemed so because they are associated with less powerful social groups or with efforts to dislodge existing power structures.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=44}}\n\nFerrell argues that anarchist criminology is a critique of the way that human relationships become submerged in, and immobilised by, structures of legal authority.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=162}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=187}} Anarchist criminology contends that law solidifies and reproduces existing structures of power, thereby placing limitations on possible social relations and exacerbating crime and violence.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=42}}\n\n===Approach to the discipline===\n\nAnarchist criminology argues that the state is not politically neutral, and that criminology cannot be neutral either. Within this framework, anarchist criminologists argue that while much criminology takes the side of the powerful, other traditions in criminology side with the oppressed and exploited.{{sfn|Nocella|Seis|Shantz|2018|p=2}}\n\nAnarchist criminologists argue that state law and [[criminalisation]] are inherently political, so acts of crime are by extension always imbued with political significance.{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=17}} As such, anarchist criminology calls for close attention to be paid to criminal (or criminalised) behaviour such as [[graffiti]] writing, \"[[obscene]]\" artistic and musical performances, [[pirate radio]] broadcasts, illegal [[strike action|strikes]], [[shoplifting]], drug use and [[hacker|hacking]],{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|pp=17\u201318}} and finds forms of political resistance in behaviours and lifestyles commonly considered criminal.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|pp=196\u20137}}\n\nFerrell describes anarchist criminology as invested in a process of demystification through which the [[epistemologies]] of certainty, truth and justice that are used to justify authority are called into question.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|pp=189\u201390}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=165}} Ferrell expresses hope that this process of \"dismantling\" the mythologies surrounding the law will \"contribute to a more general disrespect for law and authority\" by calling law's legitimacy into question.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrell|1996|p=191|ps=. See also {{harvtxt|Ferrell|1994|pp=165\u20136}}.}}</ref>\n\nFerrell argues that instead of adhering to a single masterplan, anarchist criminology is characterised by a \"spirit of eclectic inclusivity\" and an embrace of \"fluid communities of uncertainty and critique.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=18}} He also proposes that anarchist criminological orientations \"can serve not as some rigid corrective, nor competing paradigm, but as analytic sparks within an already lively alternative criminology.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=161}} Ferrell argues that anarchist criminology does not purport \"to incorporate reasoned or reasonable critiques of law and legal authority,\" but rather argues that social change requires \"unreasonable\" approaches.{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=11}} \n\n===Practical implications===\n\nAnarchist criminologists propose the replacement of existing legal systems with [[decentralised]], negotiated, [[participatory justice]].{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=372}} Such a system would, it is thought, encourage individuals to accept responsibility for their behaviour by reminding them of their connections to others in society.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=372}} Anarchist criminology argues that if law must exist, its function must be transformed so that instead of protecting private property, [[social privilege]] and state power, it would ensure tolerance and diversity.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=187}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|pp=162\u20133}} Anarchist criminology tends to favour holistic [[transformative justice]] approaches over [[restorative justice]], which it tends to argue is too beholden to the existing criminal justice system.{{sfn|Nocella|Seis|Shantz|2018|p=3}}\n\nMany anarchist criminologists endorse [[prison abolition]], arguing that prisons encourage [[recidivism]] and should be replaced by efforts to [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] offenders and reintegrate them into communities.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=45}} Ferrell argues that anarchist criminology must oppose [[moral entrepreneur]]s and associated \"[[war as metaphor|wars]]\" (the [[War on Drugs]], [[War on Gangs]], etc.), which he argues \"operate as well-planned exercises in victimization and blame, deflecting the public gaze from those in authority and toward those least able to resist it.{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=192}} Declaring \"war\" in this way, Ferrell argues, \"exacerbates and perpetuates the very problems it claims to address\" and leads to heightened violence.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=44}}\n\n==Relation to other schools of criminological thought==\n\nThe core principles of anarchist criminology are linked to those of [[abolitionism (criminology)|abolitionism]], [[critical race theory]], [[left realism]], [[peacemaking criminology]] and [[restorative justice]].{{sfn|McLaughlin|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=371, 376}} Anarchist criminology also informs [[new criminology]], [[labeling theory]], [[postmodern criminology]] and [[cultural criminology]].{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=46}} [[Stuart Henry (criminologist)|Stuart Henry]] and Scott A. Lukas argue that anarchist criminology is related to [[constitutive criminology]], cultural criminology, left realism and critical race theory, all of which they argue represent divergences from a single perspective but which also have in common the themes of peacemaking criminology and [[restorative justice]].{{sfn|Henry|Lukas|2009|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxv}} Peacemaking criminology, which argues that violent responses to social problems result in further violence and seeks to develop ways to transform violent relationships into safe and respectful relationships, also emerged from work in anarchist criminology.{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|pp=45\u20136}} Ferrell also identifies anarchist criminology as a type of [[newsmaking criminology]].{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=191}}\n\nAnarchist criminology shares with [[postmodern criminology]] the belief that domination can work through structures of information and knowledge.{{sfn|Lanier|Henry|2009|p=372}} It also shares with [[Marxist criminology]] the view that crime has its origins in an unjust social order and that a radical transformation of society is desirable.{{sfn|Ugwudike|2015|p=94}} Unlike Marxists, however, who propose that [[capitalism]] be replaced with [[socialism]], anarchists reject all hierarchical or authoritarian structures of power.{{sfn|Ugwudike|2015|p=94}} Anarchist criminology is associated with [[critical criminology]], though Anthony J. Nocella II argues that differences between the two schools reflect divergences between [[anarchism and Marxism]]: anarchist criminology foregrounds [[anti-authoritarianism]], while critical criminology shares with Marxism a willingness to accept authority when exercised by the [[proletariat]].{{sfn|Nocella|2015|p=44}} While many critical criminologists argue that state law in many cases reproduces [[economic inequality]], [[patriarchy]] and [[racism]], anarchist criminologists go further by arguing that state law is inherently harmful to people and society even when it is not overtly discriminatory.{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|p=15}}\n\nIn his case study of [[graffiti writing]], Ferrell argues that anarchist criminology must combine aspects of [[interactionism]] and political or economic criminology, as \"we cannot understand the nature of crime without understanding both its immediate construction out of social interaction and its larger construction through processes of political and economic authority.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|1996|p=188}}{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=163}} Ferrell proposes that this entails \"that anarchist criminologists must look up and down at the same time&mdash;that is, must pay attention to the subtleties of legal and political authority, the nuances of lived criminal events, and the interconnections between the two.\"<ref name=seealso>{{harvnb|Ferrell|1996|p=189|ps=. See also {{harvtxt|Ferrell|1994|pp=164\u20135}}}}</ref> However, while anarchist criminologists \"look up\" disrespectfully at hierarchical and authoritarian power structures, they \"look down and around at the lived experience of criminality ... respectfully&mdash;not with respect for any and all criminal acts, but for the possibilities of meaning that are embedded in them.\"<ref name=seealso/>\n\nFerrell also writes: <blockquote>Anarchist criminology certainly incorporates the sort of \"visceral revolt\" that characterizes anarchism itself, the passionate sense of \"fuck authority,\" to quote the old anarchist slogan, the comes from being shoved around by police officers, judges, bosses, priests, and other authorities one time too many. Moreover, anarchists would agree with many [[feminist criminology|feminist]] and postmodernist theorists that such visceral passions matter as methods of understanding and resistance outside the usual confines of rationality and respect. But anarchist criminology also incorporates a relatively complex critique of state law and legality which begins to explain why we might benefit from defying authority, or standing \"against the law.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|2018|pp=14\u201315}}</blockquote>\n\n==Anarchist criminologists==\nProminent anarchist criminologists since the 1970s have included [[Randall Amster]], who has explored anti-authoritarian forms of [[conflict resolution]] in anarchist communities;{{sfn|Ferrell|2010|p=43}} Bruce DiCristina, whose work draws on the thought of [[Paul Feyerabend]] in order to critique criminology and criminal justice;<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrell|2018|pp=13\u201314|ps=.

The SAF protects the interests, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Singapore from external threats.\n\nThe SAF relies heavily on a large pool of [[National Service in Singapore|conscripts]] in the active and reserve forces. It has an approximate active strength of around 72,000 personnel and is capable of mobilising over a million reservists in case of national exigencies or full-scale war battles. National Servicemen (NSmen) make up more than 80% of its military defence system and form the backbone of the SAF.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Military history of Singapore}}\nThe SAF was formed in 1966.\nSingapore's military role stems from its strategic geographical location, an asset exploited by both local settlers and foreign colonists alike. Archaeological excavations have discovered remnants of fortresses and other forms of military fortifications in pre-colonial Singapore. [[Sir Stamford Raffles]], founder of modern Singapore, chose Singapore in 1819 to establish a new British colony with the security concerns of the [[British Empire|British]] in the Far East in mind against the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. Thus, Singapore, which attained Crown Colony status, played an active role in British military interests for decades, particularly in the years leading up to the First and Second World Wars.\n\nThe Singapore Armed Forces has its humble origin in the [[Straits Settlements Volunteer Force]] (''SSVF'', formed in 1922) as well as Raffles Institution Army Corps formed on 15 May 1901, which in turn had its roots in the [[Singapore Volunteer Corps|Singapore Volunteer Artillery]] (''SVA'', formed in 1888). The Motto of the ''SVA'' is ''\"In Oriente Primus\"'' ({{lang-la|First in the East}}), which is still in use today by the artillery formations of the Singapore Army.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Singapore Artillery |url= http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/ourforces/Artillery/History.html |publisher= [[Ministry of Defence, Singapore]] |date= 13 November 2006 |accessdate= 17 September 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071006061511/http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/ourforces/Artillery/History.html |archive-date= 6 October 2007 |url-status = live|df= dmy-all }}</ref> In 1915 it helped to suppress the [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements#Singapore Mutiny 1915|mutiny of the Sepoys in Singapore]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the SSVF took part in the [[Battle of Singapore]] but most of its members were captured on 15 February 1942 when their positions were overrun by Japanese forces. After the end of the war, the SSVF was re-constituted in 1948, but the SVF was absorbed into the Singapore Military Forces (SMF, predecessor of the SAF) following the disbandment of the SSVF in 1954. Subsequently, in 1961, SMF was renamed to Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).\n\nWhen Singapore achieved independence in 1965, its military consisted of only two infantry regiments, commanded by British officers and made up of mostly non-Singaporean residents. Britain pulled its military out of Singapore in October 1971, leaving behind only a small amount of British, Australian and New Zealand forces as a token military presence. The last of the British soldiers left Singapore in March 1976. The New Zealand troops were the last to leave Singapore, in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1001_2009-02-10.html |title=British withdrawal from Singapore |author1=Marsita Omar |author2=Chan Fook Weng |publisher=National Library Board |date=31 December 2007 |accessdate=24 August 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621034333/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1001_2009-02-10.html |archivedate=21 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Singapore believed that it need a larger, capable yet economic-efficient defence force to protect and defend itself as it is surrounded by several larger neighbouring countries in the South-east Asia region.

Jungle warfare techniques were taught so that the Singaporean army could engage in combat conflict in the jungle areas of its neighbouring countries, if need be.

Full sets of light equipment stands ready for them in armories and heavy equipment for their units is maintained in dedicated bunkers.

Designed to replace the former defence role of the British in Singapore and Malaysia, the arrangement obliges members to consult in the event of external threat against Malaysia and Singapore. To this end, an Integrated Air Defence System is set up in Butterworth, Malaysia involving the stationing of officers from the 5 countries at its headquarters.\n\nIn 1975, President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] and Premier Lee Kuan Yew signed an agreement codenamed \u201cProject Starlight\u201d (\u661f\u5149\u8a08\u756b, also known as Hsing Kuang), wherein Singaporean troops would be sent to Taiwan for training and joint exercises. These exercises, engaging as many as 10,000 troops at any one time, provided officers a chance to simulate wartime conditions more closely and gain experience in the command and control of operations involving several battalions. Beginning in 2017, Singapore began discussions with the People's Republic of China about the possibility of ending the Starlight agreement, in the interests of improving relations with Beijing. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/09/23/2003678963 |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |title=Presidential Office mum on \u2018Starlight\u2019 |first=Sean |last=Lin |date=September 23, 2017 |access-date=2017-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926095852/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/09/23/2003678963 |archive-date=2017-09-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSingapore has consistently supported a strong [[United States armed forces|US military]] presence in the Asia-Pacific region.<ref>{{cite news|title=Singapore to join coalition against Islamic State|url=http://features.insing.com/feature/singapore-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state/id-315a3101/|accessdate=4 November 2014|agency=AFP|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104213412/http://features.insing.com/feature/singapore-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state/id-315a3101/|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1990, the US and Singapore signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) which allows the US access to Singapore facilities at [[Paya Lebar Air Base]] and the [[Sembawang]] wharves.

[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]] of the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]] as part of the city-state's [[Total Defence]] strategy.\n\nThe SAF has three services: the [[Singapore Army]], the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] (RSAF) and the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]] (RSN). The SAF protects the interests, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Singapore from external threats.\n\nThe SAF relies heavily on a large pool of [[National Service in Singapore|conscripts]] in the active and reserve forces. It has an approximate active strength of around 72,000 personnel and is capable of mobilising over a million reservists in case of national exigencies or full-scale war battles. National Servicemen (NSmen) make up more than 80% of its military defence system and form the backbone of the SAF.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Military history of Singapore}}\nThe SAF was formed in 1966.\nSingapore's military role stems from its strategic geographical location, an asset exploited by both local settlers and foreign colonists alike. Archaeological excavations have discovered remnants of fortresses and other forms of military fortifications in pre-colonial Singapore. [[Sir Stamford Raffles]], founder of modern Singapore, chose Singapore in 1819 to establish a new British colony with the security concerns of the [[British Empire|British]] in the Far East in mind against the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. Thus, Singapore, which attained Crown Colony status, played an active role in British military interests for decades, particularly in the years leading up to the First and Second World Wars.\n\nThe Singapore Armed Forces has its humble origin in the [[Straits Settlements Volunteer Force]] (''SSVF'', formed in 1922) as well as Raffles Institution Army Corps formed on 15 May 1901, which in turn had its roots in the [[Singapore Volunteer Corps|Singapore Volunteer Artillery]] (''SVA'', formed in 1888). The Motto of the ''SVA'' is ''\"In Oriente Primus\"'' ({{lang-la|First in the East}}), which is still in use today by the artillery formations of the Singapore Army.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Singapore Artillery |url= http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/ourforces/Artillery/History.html |publisher= [[Ministry of Defence, Singapore]] |date= 13 November 2006 |accessdate= 17 September 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071006061511/http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/army/ourforces/Artillery/History.html |archive-date= 6 October 2007 |url-status = live|df= dmy-all }}</ref> In 1915 it helped to suppress the [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements#Singapore Mutiny 1915|mutiny of the Sepoys in Singapore]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the SSVF took part in the [[Battle of Singapore]] but most of its members were captured on 15 February 1942 when their positions were overrun by Japanese forces. After the end of the war, the SSVF was re-constituted in 1948, but the SVF was absorbed into the Singapore Military Forces (SMF, predecessor of the SAF) following the disbandment of the SSVF in 1954. Subsequently, in 1961, SMF was renamed to Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).\n\nWhen Singapore achieved independence in 1965, its military consisted of only two infantry regiments, commanded by British officers and made up of mostly non-Singaporean residents. Britain pulled its military out of Singapore in October 1971, leaving behind only a small amount of British, Australian and New Zealand forces as a token military presence. The last of the British soldiers left Singapore in March 1976. The New Zealand troops were the last to leave Singapore, in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1001_2009-02-10.html |title=British withdrawal from Singapore |author1=Marsita Omar |author2=Chan Fook Weng |publisher=National Library Board |date=31 December 2007 |accessdate=24 August 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621034333/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1001_2009-02-10.html |archivedate=21 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Singapore believed that it need a larger, capable yet economic-efficient defence force to protect and defend itself as it is surrounded by several larger neighbouring countries in the South-east Asia region. At that time, Singapore enlisted the covert assistance of [[Israel]], which sent its military advisers who helped Singapore set up a defence force modelled in part after the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Jungle warfare techniques were taught so that the Singaporean army could engage in combat conflict in the jungle areas of its neighbouring countries, if need be.

Singapore is, after all, a small island state country (720&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and it lacks the hinterland for a [[Defence in depth]] strategy. In historical news archives, there were also defence analogies used by Singapore founders that Singapore must be a poison shrimp and later, porcupine.

Full sets of light equipment stands ready for them in armories and heavy equipment for their units is maintained in dedicated bunkers. Singapore is very high tech and individuals can be reached almost instantly; thus the system is highly flexible, so only the units and numbers needed for a particular task can be summoned.

Upon completion of their NSF stint, servicemen will be considered as having reached their Operationally-ready Date (ORD) and will be known as Operationally-ready National Servicemen (NSmen). Almost all NSmen will have to go through a 10-year reservist cycle of military training with their assigned unit deployment. Almost all NSmen are obliged to be called up annually for a maximum of 40 days per workyear for national duties, refresher trainings, mobilisations, upgrading courses and physical fitness tests and conditioning, depending on their NS unit deployment.<ref name=\"mindef.gov.sg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/nsmen|title=NS Matters|website=mindef.gov.sg|accessdate=12 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525180700/https://www.mindef.gov.sg/nsmen|archive-date=25 May 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\n{{See also|Recruit training}}\n[[File:SAFTI MI OCS 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Officer Cadet School (Singapore)|Officer Cadet School]] building within the SAFTI Military Institute as seen from the northwest]]\nPrior to enlistment, pre-enlistees (recruits) are required to attend a medical examination ([[PULHHEEMS]]) to determine their medical status to assess vocational suitability postings. They will then be issued a \"Physical Employment Status\" (PES), which will be used as a guideline to determine for which vocation groupings they are deemed suitable.\n\nPES A and PES B1 (combat-fit) recruits go through a nine-week [[Recruit training|Basic Military Training]] (BMT) program, held at the [[Basic Military Training Centre]] (BMTC) on the offshore island of [[Pulau Tekong]]. Recruits who are considered [[Obesity|obese]], are required to attend a 19-week PES Bp BMT weight-loss program. PES B2 formally PES C1 (fit for some combat vocations) recruits will go through a nine-week modified BMT programme at BMTC. PES C and PES E recruits (non-combat-fit) undertake a nine-week modified BMT program in BMTC School V at Kranji Camp II, where serviceman undergoing a four-week modified BMT programme before being deployed to various combat service support vocations such as Admin Support Assistants (ASA), Transport Operators, and Storeman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/portal/mindef/news-and-events/latest-releases/article-detail/2019/March/18mar19_fs|title=Fact Sheet - Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) School V|last=hermesauto|date=18 March 2019|access-date=20 October 2019|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The One-BMT programme was fully implemented on November 2017 thus all servicemen including mono-intakes with the exception of those in commandos, naval divers and service support vocation units will complete their BMT at BMTC.

The selected ones among NS recruits in BMT are assessed via SITEST for suitability of commander trainings to become [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] or [[Specialist (Singapore)|specialists]]. They are posted to the [[Officer Cadet School (Singapore)|Officer Cadet School]] (OCS) or the [[Specialist Cadet School]] (SCS) respectively for commander training. The majority of the rest of recruits, known as enlistees, are posted to various NS units or vocational training institutes where the newly minted privates undergo continuous, specialised and further vocational trainings to pass out successfully as a vocationalist.\n\nDue to land space limitations on Singapore's territorial land and waters, some specialised training programmes and facilities are located overseas e.g. 130 Squadron in Australia, 150 Squadron in France.\n\n===Military education===\nInitially, [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] were drawn exclusively from the ranks of Singaporeans who had completed their [[GCE Advanced Level|GCE A levels]] or embarked on tertiary studies.<ref name=\"minchin\">Minchin, James. ''No Man is an Island'', p. 227. Allen & Unwin Australia, 1986.</ref> While the requirements have since been revised, the SAF has still been criticised for \"using a promotion system that is based more on education and scholarships than on proven competence\".<ref name=\"walsh\"/>\n\nOfficers receive their initial leadership training at the tri-service OCS in the [[SAFTI Military Institute]] (SAFTI MI). As they progress in their career, they may undergo further formal military education at the SAF Advanced Schools and the [[Singapore Command and Staff College]]. On the other hand, [[Specialist (Singapore)|specialists]] first receive leadership training at the SCS. Future [[platoon sergeant]]s and [[Company Sergeant Major|Company Sergeant Majors]] receive further instruction at the Advanced Specialist Training Wing (ASTW) in SCS. Specialists undergo further education at the [[SAF Warrant Officer School]] before receiving their appointments as [[Warrant Officer]]s.\n\nOCS and SCS both have an [[infantry]]-based curriculum; special-to-arms training for both officers and WOSPECs is conducted at various training institutes and establishments such as the [[SAF Medical Training Institute]] (SMTI), Artillery Institute (AI), [[Singapore Signals#Signal Institute (SI)|Signals Institute]] (SI), [[Singapore Combat Engineers#Engineer Training Institute (ETI)|Engineer Training Institute]] (ETI), Armour Training Institute (ATI), Motorised Infantry Training Institute (MITI), Supply & Transport Centre (STC) and Ordnance Engineering Training Institute (OETI).\n\n[[Pointer (journal)|Pointer]] is the official journal of the SAF. It is a quarterly publication distributed to all Officers and Warrant Officers, which helps with their ongoing professional education.\n\n===Foreign defence relations===\nSingapore is part of the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]], whose other members include the United Kingdom, Australia, [[New Zealand]] and [[Malaysia]]. Designed to replace the former defence role of the British in Singapore and Malaysia, the arrangement obliges members to consult in the event of external threat against Malaysia and Singapore. To this end, an Integrated Air Defence System is set up in Butterworth, Malaysia involving the stationing of officers from the 5 countries at its headquarters.\n\nIn 1975, Premier Chiang Ching-kuo and Lee Kuan Yew signed an agreement codenamed \u201cProject Starlight\u201d (\u661f\u5149\u8a08\u756b, also known as Hsing Kuang), wherein Singaporean troops would be sent to Taiwan for training and joint exercises. These exercises, engaging as many as 10,000 troops at any one time, provided officers a chance to simulate wartime conditions more closely and gain experience in the command and control of operations involving several battalions. Beginning in 2017, Singapore began discussions with the People's Republic of China about the possibility of ending the Starlight agreement, in the interests of improving relations with Beijing. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/09/23/2003678963 |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |title=Presidential Office mum on \u2018Starlight\u2019 |first=Sean |last=Lin |date=September 23, 2017 |access-date=2017-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926095852/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/09/23/2003678963 |archive-date=2017-09-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSingapore has consistently supported a strong [[United States armed forces|US military]] presence in the Asia-Pacific region.<ref>{{cite news|title=Singapore to join coalition against Islamic State|url=http://features.insing.com/feature/singapore-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state/id-315a3101/|accessdate=4 November 2014|agency=AFP|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104213412/http://features.insing.com/feature/singapore-to-join-coalition-against-islamic-state/id-315a3101/|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1990, the US and Singapore signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) which allows the US access to Singapore facilities at [[Paya Lebar Air Base]] and the [[Sembawang]] wharves.

It ranks first in Canada for the scope of its engineering research.<ref>http://www.polymtl.ca/futur/esen/</ref> It is occasionally referred to as Montreal Polytechnic, although in [[Quebec English]] its French name is more commonly used.  The school offers [[Graduate School|graduate]] and [[postgraduate]] training, and is very active in research.  Following tradition, new [[Bachelor of Engineering|Bachelors of Engineering]] (B.Eng) graduating from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique receive an [[Iron Ring]], during the Canadian [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] ceremony.\n\n==History==\nThe Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al was founded in 1873 in order to teach [[technical drawing]] and other [[useful arts]]. At first, it was set in a converted residence. It later moved to a larger building on Saint-Denis street. In 1958, it moved to its current location on the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al campus. The original building was enlarged in 1975 and then in 1989. In 2002, the Computer and Electrical Engineering Department (they were later separated) began to occupy the 5th and 6th floor of the old [[HEC Montr\u00e9al|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Montr\u00e9al]] building. In 2003, the construction of three new buildings started.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the main purpose of the school was to train engineers. However, from 1959 on, the focus went to research. Nowadays, it is a leading research institution in applied sciences in Canada.\n\nIn 1977, a [[SLOWPOKE reactor]], named SLOWPOKE-2, was installed at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al. The non-power reactor operating licence was renewed and is valid from July 1, 2013 until June 30, 2023. The reactor has been in operation for 36 years and is used for research, teaching, neutron generation and isotope production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/commission/pdf/2013-05-15-Decision-Polytechnique-SLOWPOKE-2-e-Edocs4160818.pdf |title=Record of Proceedings, Including Reasons for Decision: Application for Renewal of the Non-power Operating Licence for Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal's Non-power Reactor |publisher=Canada Nuclear Power Commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016234815/http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/commission/pdf/2013-05-15-Decision-Polytechnique-SLOWPOKE-2-e-Edocs4160818.pdf |archive-date=October 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1989 Shooting===\n\n{{main|\u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre}}\n\n[[File:Mtl dec6 plaque.jpg|left|150px|thumb|right|Plaque commemorating the murder of 14 female students (6 December 1989)]]\n\nOn December 6, 1989, 25-year-old Canadian [[Marc L\u00e9pine]] entered the campus of \u00c9cole Polytechnique and fatally shot 14 women, wounding 10 other women and four men before killing himself on campus. The massacre is the deadliest shooting incident in Canadian history. This event is commemorated by the Canadian government as the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]].\n\n==Campus==\nThe school's campus is located on the northern face of [[Mount Royal]]. Its main building is the highest building on the main campus of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. The J.-Armand-Bombardier building sits beside the main building and mainly serves for research activities and as an emergence centre for spin-off companies, designed to support the pre-startup of technology-based businesses.  The building is named for [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]], the inventor of the [[snowmobile]].\n\nThe Pierre-Lassonde et Claudette-Mackay-Lassonde building, home to the Electrical Engineering Department and Computer and Software Engineering Department, was inaugurated in September 2005.  This new building won an \"Award of Merit\" from ''Canadian Architect'' magazine in 2003, received a Gold certification from the [[Green building|U.S. Green Building Council]] and scored 46 on the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] points scale which was, at inauguration, the highest score ever obtained in Canada.  The energy performance of the Lassonde buildings is 60% better than the standard set by the Model National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdnarchitect.com/Issues/ISarticle.asp?id=144538&story_id=203158141837&issue=12012003&PC= |title=Award of Merit: Pavillon Lassonde, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al| work=Canadian Architect |archive-date=July 29, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729112114/http://www.cdnarchitect.com/issues/ISarticle.asp?id=144538&story_id=203158141837&issue=12012003&PC= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour/en/article.php?no=2153 |title=GOLD for \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al's new \"green\" buildings - A tangible response to the challenge of climate change |publisher=\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al |date=November 30, 2005|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe Polytechnique is one of the three largest engineering schools in [[Canada]], and the largest one in the province of [[Quebec]]. Since its foundation in 1873, this [[French language]] educational establishment trains [[engineer]]s and specialists. The school contributes to the scientific and economic expansion of the region. Its graduates were part of most of Quebec's major engineering works of the 20th century such as the construction of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]]. The \u00c9cole Polytechnique is in the forefront of engineering in many fields such as [[aeronautics]], [[computer engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[biotechnology]], [[nanotechnology]], [[environmental science]], [[artificial intelligence]], and many other high-end domains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nPolytechnique offers 12 undergraduate programs, managed by seven departments.

It ranks first in Canada for the scope of its engineering research.<ref>http://www.polymtl.ca/futur/esen/</ref> It is occasionally referred to as Montreal Polytechnic, although in [[Quebec English]] its French name is more commonly used.  The school offers [[Graduate School|graduate]] and [[postgraduate]] training, and is very active in research.  Following tradition, new [[Bachelor of Engineering|Bachelors of Engineering]] (B.Eng) graduating from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique receive an [[Iron Ring]], during the Canadian [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] ceremony.\n\n==History==\nThe Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al was founded in 1873 in order to teach [[technical drawing]] and other [[useful arts]]. At first, it was set in a converted residence. It later moved to a larger building on Saint-Denis street. In 1958, it moved to its current location on the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al campus. The original building was enlarged in 1975 and then in 1989. In 2002, the Computer and Electrical Engineering Department (they were later separated) began to occupy the 5th and 6th floor of the old [[HEC Montr\u00e9al|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Montr\u00e9al]] building. In 2003, the construction of three new buildings started.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the main purpose of the school was to train engineers. However, from 1959 on, the focus went to research. Nowadays, it is a leading research institution in applied sciences in Canada.\n\nIn 1977, a [[SLOWPOKE reactor]], named SLOWPOKE-2, was installed at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al. The non-power reactor operating licence was renewed and is valid from July 1, 2013 until June 30, 2023. The reactor has been in operation for 36 years and is used for research, teaching, neutron generation and isotope production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/commission/pdf/2013-05-15-Decision-Polytechnique-SLOWPOKE-2-e-Edocs4160818.pdf |title=Record of Proceedings, Including Reasons for Decision: Application for Renewal of the Non-power Operating Licence for Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal's Non-power Reactor |publisher=Canada Nuclear Power Commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016234815/http://www.nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/commission/pdf/2013-05-15-Decision-Polytechnique-SLOWPOKE-2-e-Edocs4160818.pdf |archive-date=October 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1989 Shooting===\n\n{{main|\u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre}}\n\n[[File:Mtl dec6 plaque.jpg|left|150px|thumb|right|Plaque commemorating the murder of 14 female students (6 December 1989)]]\n\nOn December 6, 1989, 25-year-old Canadian [[Marc L\u00e9pine]] entered the campus of \u00c9cole Polytechnique and fatally shot 14 women, wounding 10 other women and four men before killing himself on campus. The massacre is the deadliest shooting incident in Canadian history. This event is commemorated by the Canadian government as the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]].\n\n==Campus==\nThe school's campus is located on the northern face of [[Mount Royal]]. Its main building is the highest building on the main campus of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. The J.-Armand-Bombardier building sits beside the main building and mainly serves for research activities and as an emergence centre for spin-off companies, designed to support the pre-startup of technology-based businesses.  The building is named for [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]], the inventor of the [[snowmobile]].\n\nThe Pierre-Lassonde et Claudette-Mackay-Lassonde building, home to the Electrical Engineering Department and Computer and Software Engineering Department, was inaugurated in September 2005.  This new building won an \"Award of Merit\" from ''Canadian Architect'' magazine in 2003, received a Gold certification from the [[Green building|U.S. Green Building Council]] and scored 46 on the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] points scale which was, at inauguration, the highest score ever obtained in Canada.  The energy performance of the Lassonde buildings is 60% better than the standard set by the Model National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdnarchitect.com/Issues/ISarticle.asp?id=144538&story_id=203158141837&issue=12012003&PC= |title=Award of Merit: Pavillon Lassonde, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al| work=Canadian Architect |archive-date=July 29, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729112114/http://www.cdnarchitect.com/issues/ISarticle.asp?id=144538&story_id=203158141837&issue=12012003&PC= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour/en/article.php?no=2153 |title=GOLD for \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al's new \"green\" buildings - A tangible response to the challenge of climate change |publisher=\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al |date=November 30, 2005|accessdate=March 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe Polytechnique is one of the three largest engineering schools in [[Canada]], and the largest one in the province of [[Quebec]]. Since its foundation in 1873, this [[French language]] educational establishment trains [[engineer]]s and specialists. The school contributes to the scientific and economic expansion of the region. Its graduates were part of most of Quebec's major engineering works of the 20th century such as the construction of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]]. The \u00c9cole Polytechnique is in the forefront of engineering in many fields such as [[aeronautics]], [[computer engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[biotechnology]], [[nanotechnology]], [[environmental science]], [[artificial intelligence]], and many other high-end domains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nPolytechnique offers 12 undergraduate programs, managed by seven departments.
