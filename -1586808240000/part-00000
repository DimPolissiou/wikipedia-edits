''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.<ref name=tws21decgghg/>}}\nThere has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].\n\n===Natural Rights===\n[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]\n\n* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are \"natural\" in the sense of \"not artificial, not man-made\", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.\n\n===Claim versus liberty===\n{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}\n* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').<ref name=IEP>Fagan, Andrew. \"Human Rights\". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b</ref> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \"Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \"life, liberty, and property\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.<ref name=\"IEP\" /> This can be expressed in logic as: \"Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.\n\nLiberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.\n\n===Positive versus negative===\n{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}\nIn one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:\n* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \"right to welfare.\"<ref name=tws21decgkfjf/>\n* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.<ref name=tws21decgkfjf>{{cite news\n|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.\n|publisher = Stanford University\n|date = July 9, 2007\n|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}</ref>\n\nThough similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").\n\n===Individual versus group===\n{{Main|Individual and group rights}}\nThe general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name=tws18decafafa>{{cite news\n|author = Ayn Rand\n|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights\n|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]\n|publisher = The Ayn Rand Lexicon\n|date = 2009-12-18\n|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html\n|accessdate = 2009-12-18\n}}</ref> However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''.<ref>For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, ''Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws'', 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017).</ref> Accordingly:\n* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.\n[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]\n* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \"right\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \"group\" as well as by the term \"group rights.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.\n\nThe [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].\n\n===Other senses===\nOther distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \"Miranda rights\". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]\nRights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.\n\nRights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.\n\nSome examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],<ref name=tws21decghnnb>{{cite magazine\n|author = Kate Pickert\n|title = Undercover Animal-Rights Investigator\n|quote = One of the most powerful tools animal-rights activists have is the video footage shot inside places like poorly run dog kennels, animal-testing facilities and factory farms, used as grim evidence of the brutality that can take place.

The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".\n\nFurther, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].<ref name=tws21dece563e>{{cite news\n|author = John E.

Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].\n\nWhile normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What ''is'' goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.\n\nRights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).\nRights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:\n* Duties ([[deontology]])\n* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])\n* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])\n* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])\n\nRights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.\n\n===Criticism===\nSome philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85\u201388 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}</ref> Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of human rights}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Magna Carta]]'' or \"The Great Charter\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights.

In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.\n\nHistorically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news\n|title = Divine Right of Kings\n|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.\n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 2007-10-11\n|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20071011.shtml\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.\n\nImportant documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:\n\n* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]].

Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]\nThere is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.\n\nOne way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.<ref name=tws21decgghg>{{cite news\n|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just.

''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.<ref name=tws21decgghg/>}}\nThere has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].\n\n===Natural Rights===\n[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]\n\n* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are \"natural\" in the sense of \"not artificial, not man-made\", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.\n\n===Claim versus liberty===\n{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}\n* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').<ref name=IEP>Fagan, Andrew. \"Human Rights\". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b</ref> In logic, this idea can be expressed as: \"Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.\" Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like \"life, liberty, and property\"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.<ref name=\"IEP\" /> This can be expressed in logic as: \"Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.\" For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.\n\nLiberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.\n\n===Positive versus negative===\n{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}\nIn one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:\n* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported \"right to welfare.\"<ref name=tws21decgkfjf/>\n* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.<ref name=tws21decgkfjf>{{cite news\n|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.\n|publisher = Stanford University\n|date = July 9, 2007\n|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}</ref>\n\nThough similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass \"privileges\" and \"powers\") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass \"claims\" and \"immunities\").\n\n===Individual versus group===\n{{Main|Individual and group rights}}\nThe general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name=tws18decafafa>{{cite news\n|author = Ayn Rand\n|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights\n|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]\n|publisher = The Ayn Rand Lexicon\n|date = 2009-12-18\n|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html\n|accessdate = 2009-12-18\n}}</ref> However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''.<ref>For a general discussion see. Charles Edward Andrew Lincoln IV, ''Hegelian Dialectical Analysis of U.S. Voting Laws'', 42 U. Dayton L. Rev. 87 (2017).</ref> Accordingly:\n* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.\n[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]\n* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a \"right\" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term \"group\" as well as by the term \"group rights.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed \"individual rights\" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the \"group rights\" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.\n\nThe [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].\n\n===Other senses===\nOther distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their \"Miranda rights\". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]\nRights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.\n\nRights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.\n\nSome examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],<ref name=tws21decghnnb>{{cite magazine\n|author = Kate Pickert\n|title = Undercover Animal-Rights Investigator\n|quote = One of the most powerful tools animal-rights activists have is the video footage shot inside places like poorly run dog kennels, animal-testing facilities and factory farms, used as grim evidence of the brutality that can take place.

The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a \"right to medical care\" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the \"right to a fair trial\".\n\nFurther, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of \"rights\" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].<ref name=tws21dece563e>{{cite news\n|author = John E.

Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].\n\nWhile normative ethics addresses such questions as \"What should one do?\", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as \"What ''is'' goodness?\" and \"How can we tell what is good from what is bad?\", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.\n\nRights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).\nRights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:\n* Duties ([[deontology]])\n* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])\n* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])\n* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])\n\nRights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.\n\n===Criticism===\nSome philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them \"nonsense upon stilts\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85\u201388 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}</ref> Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of human rights}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Magna Carta]]'' or \"The Great Charter\" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights.

In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.\n\nHistorically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a right of the son to receive something in return for that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave much possibility for many rights for the subjects themselves.<ref name=tws21decfrre>{{cite news\n|title = Divine Right of Kings\n|quote = [...] the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers [...] was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.\n|publisher = BBC\n|date = 2007-10-11\n|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20071011.shtml\n|accessdate = 2009-12-21\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.\n\nImportant documents in the [[political history]] of rights include:\n\n* The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]] established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under [[Cyrus the Great]].

In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.\n\nI-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany\u2013Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== New York State Thruway ===\n{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}\nWest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991\u20132000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]\nEast of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center.

In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], I-90 extends {{convert|385.88|mi|2}} from the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] to the [[Massachusetts]] state line at [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]], and is the second-longest highway in the state after [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]]. Although most of the route is part of the tolled [[New York State Thruway]], two non-tolled sections exist along I-90 (the first, situated outside of Buffalo, is included in the Thruway system; the second, situated in the [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], is not part of the Thruway system and links [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and its eastern suburbs). Within New York, I-90 has a complete set of auxiliary Interstates, which means that there are interstates numbered [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] through [[Interstate 990|I-990]] in the state, with no gaps in between. For most of its length in New York, I-90 runs parallel to the former [[Erie Canal]] route, [[New York State Route&nbsp;5]] (NY&nbsp;5), [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] (US&nbsp;20) and the [[CSX]] railroad mainline that traverses the state.\n\nI-90 was assigned in 1957 as part of the establishment of the Interstate Highway System. In New York, it was overlaid on the pre-existing New York State Thruway from Pennsylvania to Albany, from where it would have continued to Massachusetts on a new freeway that bypassed the [[Berkshire Connector]] to the north. Ultimately, the freeway was built from the Thruway mainline in Albany to the Berkshire Connector in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and I-90 was assigned to the segment of the Connector east of the proposed freeway. The Albany\u2013Schodack freeway was completed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s and fully open by 1977.\n\n== Route description ==\n\n=== New York State Thruway ===\n{{Main|New York State Thruway#Mainline|l1=New York State Thruway (mainline)}}\nWest of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], I-90 in New York is designated along the mainline of the [[New York State Thruway]]. The Thruway begins at the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], following the shore of [[Lake Erie]] northeast and passes through the town of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], a large [[suburb]] of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] directly east of the city. Two auxiliary routes, [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] (leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and connecting into Canada as [[Ontario Highway 405]]) and [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] (a northerly bypass of Buffalo) connect with I-90 here. Both auxiliary routes provide access between I-90 and Canada's largest city, [[Toronto]]. East of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]], the Thruway turns east and passes through the suburbs of several major cities in [[Upstate New York]], generally following the path of the [[Erie Canal]]. It passes south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and north of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], which are served by three auxiliary Interstate Highways: [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and [[Interstate 390|I-390]] connect to Rochester, while [[Interstate 690|I-690]] leads to Syracuse.<ref name=\"2009map\">{{cite map |title=New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |year=2009 |cartography=[[Map Works]]}}</ref>  The speed limit, enforced by the [[New York State Police]], is 65 miles per hour along most of this stretch.<ref name=\"speedlimit\">{{cite web|title=History of NY Thruway 1991\u20132000|url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|accessdate=June 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815074637/http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml|archive-date=August 15, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-90 west in West Seneca NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching exit&nbsp;54 on I-90 westbound in West Seneca]]\nEast of Syracuse, the Thruway follows the Erie Canal and, later, the [[Mohawk River]] into the [[Mohawk Valley]] toward [[Utica, New York|Utica]], where I-90 skirts the northern edge of downtown and meets [[Interstate 790|I-790]], a short route leading into the city's center.
