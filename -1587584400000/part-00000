Situated in the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship]], it is the county seat of the [[\u0141\u0119czyca County]].\n\n== Origin of the Name ==\nThe town was probably named after a [[West Slavs|Slavic]] tribe called Leczanie, which inhabited central Poland in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Some scholars however claim that the town was named after an Old Polish word \u0142\u0119g, which means a swampy plain.\n\nIn medieval Latin documents, \u0141\u0119czyca is called Lonsin, Lucic, Lunciz, Lantsiza, Loncizia, Lonsitia and Lunchicia. In the early 12th century, [[Gallus Anonymus]] called \u0141\u0119czyca \u201cLucic\u201d, and in 1154, Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] named it Nugrada, placing it among other main towns of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]], such as [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sieradz]], [[Gniezno]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Santok]].\n\n== Location ==\n\u0141\u0119czyca lies in the middle of the county, and has the area of {{convert|8.95|km2|2|abbr=in}}. In the past, the town was the capital of the [[Ziemia|Land]] of \u0141\u0119czyca, which was later turned into [[\u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship]]. In the [[Second Polish Republic]] and in 1945 - 1975, \u0141\u0119czyca belonged to [[Lodz Voivodeship]]. In 1975-1998, it was part of [[Plock Voivodeship]]. The geometric centre of Poland is located near \u0141\u0119czyca.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Matejko Sejm w \u0141\u0119czycy 1182.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''[[First Sejm in \u0141\u0119czyca|The First Parliament in \u0141\u0119czyca]]'', by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\u0141\u0119czyca is one of the oldest Polish cities, mentioned in the 12th century. It was the place of the first recorded meeting of [[Sejm]], the Polish parliament, in 1182. In 1229 it became the capital of the [[Duchy of \u0141\u0119czyca]] (see [[Testament of Boleslaw III Wrymouth]]), which in 1263 was split into two parts - the Duchy of \u0141\u0119czyca and the [[Duchy of Sieradz]]. In the early 14th century, the [[\u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship]] was created. This administrative unit of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] existed until the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century.\n\n\u0141\u0119czyca, which lies in the centre of Poland, was for centuries one of the most important cities of the country. It received [[Magdeburg rights]] before 1267, and in 1331 the [[Teutonic Knights]] sacked the city during one of their repeated incursions into Poland. A considerable number of buildings were burned down, including two churches.  A few decades later, on the initiative of [[Casimir the Great]], the city was walled and [[\u0141\u0119czyca Castle|a castle]] built to the southeast of the city.<ref name=\"guidebook\">{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=\u0141\u0119czyca, Poland (official tourist guide) |year= |publisher=Urz\u0105d Miasta \u0141\u0119czyca (Municipal Office of \u0141\u0119czyca) |location=\u0141\u0119czyca, Poland |id= }}</ref>\n\n\u0141\u0119czyca prospered in the period between the mid-14th and mid-17th centuries. The royal castle, built by Casimir the Great, was located on a small hill, protected by a moat with water from the [[Bzura]] river. The complex was made from red brick, set on stone foundations. It was protected by a 10-meter high wall, with a tower located in its southwestern corner. Gate tower was placed in the western wall, in the basement was a prison, and in the courtyard there was a two-storey tenement building. Rooms of that building frequently housed meetings of the Royal Council. In 1964, widespread renovation of the complex began. Another building was added at that time, which now houses the Museum of the Land of \u0141\u0119czyca.\n\nSoon after its completion in the mid-14th century, the castle was named one of royal residences, and the seat of the [[Starosta]] of \u0141\u0119czyca. In 1406, it was burned by the [[Teutonic Knights]], but the complex was rebuilt so quickly that in 1409, King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] attended here a meeting of his advisors, discussing the oncoming war with the Knights.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410), a number of high-ranking Teutonic prisoners was kept here for ransom. Four sessions of the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) took place here: in 1420, 1448, 1454 i 1462. Furthermore, the castle served as headquarters of King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], during the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)]]. At that time, the \u0141\u0119czyca Voivodeship was divided into three counties - Brzeziny, Orzel and \u0141\u0119czyca. In 1420, a [[Bohemia]]n delegation offered here Czech crown to Jagie\u0142\u0142o. The city's prominence came to an end with the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish invasion]] of Poland when the castle was overrun and most of the city once again destroyed, and it remained in a state of crisis until the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]].<ref name=\"guidebook\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[invasion of Poland]] at the start of the [[Second World War]], \u0141\u0119czyca was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] and incorporated into the region known as [[Reichsgau Wartheland]] as part of the district (''kreis'') of Lentsch\u00fctz (Germanized word for '\u0141\u0119czyca'). In January 1942 there was a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor camp]] operating in or near the town.<ref>''Zwangsarbeit im NS-Staat'' at German Federal Archive (Bundesarchiv) [https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php.en?action=2.2&tab=3&id=2474] Accessed September 29, 2011.</ref> After the war it was reintegrated into the [[People's Republic of Poland]].\n\n== Notable locations ==\n[[File:\u0141\u0119czyca view.jpg|thumb|A view from the castle tower|250px]]\n[[File:Ratusz w \u0141\u0119czycy.jpg|thumb|Town hall of \u0141\u0119czyca|250px]]\nBecause of its royal history \u0141\u0119czyca is probably more tourist-worthy than its current size might suggest.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers. This conceptualization is found within several Buddhist schools, including the Therav\u0101dins and the [[Mahasanghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghikas]].<!--21-22 n 78-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=17\u201318, note 62, 20\u201322, note 78}} Indeed, Therav\u0101da sees him as a sort of \"Father of the Church\".{{sfn |Lagirarde |2006}}\n\n=== Historical lineages ===\nFurthermore, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is described in the P\u0101li commentary to the ''D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya'' as the person responsible for the preservation of collection that was the precursor to the ''Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya'' and the ''Sa\u1e43yuktaka \u0100gama''. In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]] instead.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop with Marty as an investor. Roy also convinces Russ to say he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty.

Wendy attends a prayer breakfast to woo faltering senators and resorts to blackmail. Wilkes makes a play for Wendy as the price for obtaining the vote of the last senate holdout, but Wendy rebuffs him. Wendy sees Mason preaching on the streets of Jefferson City, baby Zeke at his side. Rachel's drug-and-drinking binge causes her to wreck her car, leading Roy to turn her into an informant against Marty and send her back to the Blue Cat.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour.

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nIndeed, the term ''silicic acid'' has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silica]], SiO<sub>2</sub>. Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>. \n:SiO<sub>2</sub>\u2193 + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> \n\nAn ancient industrial notation referring to {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, [[metasilicic acid]], is also often used to depict the alkali-silica reaction. However, the metasilicic acid, {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, or {{Chem|SiO|(OH)|2}}, is a hypothetic molecule which has never been observed, even in extreme diluted solutions because {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}} is unstable and continue to hydrate. \n\nIndeed, contrary to the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> which consumes only one water molecule and stops at H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, the hydration of SiO<sub>2</sub> consumes two water molecules and continues one step further to form H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The difference in [[hydration energy|hydration]] behaviour between SiO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is explained by [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons ([[Gibbs free energy]]) and by [[bond energy]] or [[steric hindrance]] around the central atom of the molecule. \n\nThat is why the more correct geochemical notation referring to the [[orthosilicic acid]] {{Chem|Si|(OH)|4}} really existing in dilute solution is preferred here. However, the main advantage of the now deprecated, but still often used, industrial notation referring to the metasilicate anion ({{Chem|Si|O|3|2\u2013}}), which also does not exist in aqueous solution, is its greater simplicity and its direct similitude in notation with the carbonate ({{Chem|C|O|3|2\u2013}}) system. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species ([[alkali hydroxide]]s, also often simply called [[alkali]]) responsible for the silica dissolution in the alkali-silica reaction do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation of the ultimate reaction with portlandite, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Anhydrous and hydrated silica surface with [[siloxane]] and [[silanol]] groups along with surface bound water molecules.]]\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. \n\nThe presence of these oxygen-bearing groups very prone to form [[hydrogen bond]]s with water molecules explains the affinity of silica for water and makes colloidal silica very [[hydrophile]]. \n\nSiloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):\n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of dissolved NaOH or KOH, responsible for the high pH (~13.5) of the concrete pore water, the amorphous silica of the reactive aggregates would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).\n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with lime)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase.<ref name=\"Samari_2019\">{{cite journal|last1=Samari|first1=Mohammad|last2=Ridha|first2=Firas|last3=Manovic|first3=Vasilije|last4=Macchi|first4=Arturo|last5=Anthony|first5=E.

This gives the following set of reactions also commonly encountered in the literature to schematically depict the continuous regeneration of NaOH in ASR: \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(SiO<sub>2</sub> quickly dissolved by hygroscopic NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with portlandite)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction ressembling the [[Pozzolanic reaction]])\n|}\n\nIf NaOH is clearly deficient in the system under consideration (soda lime or alkali-silica reaction), it is formally possible to write the same reactions sets by simply replacing the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HSiO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the principle of catalysis remaining the same, even if the number of intermediate species differs.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release {{chem|OH|-}} into solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of [[sodium carbonate]] with portlandite, also important for the [[catalysis]] of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as emphasized by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste), calcium sulfo-aluminate phases ([[AFm phase|AFm]] and AFt, [[ettringite]]) and [[hydrogarnet]]. C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) (~&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;10<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;M at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C) and therefore are expected to play a negligible role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also cause, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (here, explicitly written in the ancient industrial metasilicate notation (based on the non-existing [[metasilicic acid]], {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}) to also illustrate the frequent use of this later in the literature): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected aggregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.\n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous non-stoechiometric calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H, the non-stoechiometry being denoted here by the use of dashes) can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:\n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.\n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Curative treatment==\nThere are no curative treatments in general for ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Prevention of the risk==\nThe only way to prevent, or to limit, the risk of ASR is to avoid one or several of the three elements in the critical triangle aggregate reactivity \u2013 cement alkali content \u2013 water: \n* by selecting non-reactive aggregates after testing them according to an appropriate standard test method (see next section); \n* by using a low-alkali (LA) cement: with a maximum alkali content expressed in {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}} < 0.60&nbsp;% of the cement mass, according to EN&nbsp;197-1 European standard for cement,<ref name=\"EN197_1\">EN&nbsp;197-1 European Standard. Cement \u2013 Part 1: Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements.</ref> or by limiting the total alkali content in concrete (''e.g.'', less than 3&nbsp;kg {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}/m<sup>3</sup> of concrete for a CEM&nbsp;I cement (OPC)). Example of standard for concrete in Belgium: NBN EN 206 and its national supplement NBN B 15-001<ref name=\"EN_206\">NBN EN 206:2013+A1:2016 Concrete \u2013 Specification, performance, production and conformity.

Publication date: 07/2018. </ref>; \n* by limiting the contact of underground or meteoritic water infiltrations with the concrete structure (water tight membrane, roofing, sufficient water drainage, ...). This last precaution is always advisable when possible and the only one also sometimes applicable for existing ASR-affected concrete structures.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

The gel exudations through the concrete cracks have a characteristic yellow color and a high pH.]]\n\nTo attempt to simplify and to stylize a very complex set of various reactions, the whole ASR reaction, after its complete evolution (ageing process) in the presence of sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations available in solution, could be compared to the [[pozzolanic reaction]] which would be catalysed by the undesirable presence of excessive concentrations of alkali hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) in the concrete. It is a mineral acid-base reaction between [[NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[calcium hydroxide]], also known as [[portlandite]], or (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), and [[silicic acid]] (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>). For simplifying, after a complete exchange of the alkali cations with the calcium ions released by portlandite, the alkali-silica reaction in its ultimate stage leading to [[calcium silicate hydrate]] (C-S-H) could be schematically represented as following:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Ca<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nHere, the silicic acid H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, which is equivalent to SiO<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 2 H<sub>2</sub>O represents hydrous or amorphous silica for the sake of simplicity in aqueous chemistry. \n\nIndeed, the term ''silicic acid'' has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silica]], SiO<sub>2</sub>. Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>. \n:SiO<sub>2</sub>\u2193 + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> \n\nAn ancient industrial notation referring to {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, [[metasilicic acid]], is also often used to depict the alkali-silica reaction. However, the metasilicic acid, {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}, or {{Chem|SiO|(OH)|2}}, is a hypothetic molecule which has never been observed, even in extreme diluted solutions because {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}} is unstable and continue to hydrate. \n\nIndeed, contrary to the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> which consumes only one water molecule and stops at H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, the hydration of SiO<sub>2</sub> consumes two water molecules and continues one step further to form H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The difference in [[hydration energy|hydration]] behaviour between SiO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is explained by [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons ([[Gibbs free energy]]) and by [[bond energy]] or [[steric hindrance]] around the central atom of the molecule. \n\nThat is why the more correct geochemical notation referring to the [[orthosilicic acid]] {{Chem|Si|(OH)|4}} really existing in dilute solution is preferred here. However, the main advantage of the now deprecated, but still often used, industrial notation referring to the metasilicate anion ({{Chem|Si|O|3|2\u2013}}), which also does not exist in aqueous solution, is its greater simplicity and its direct similitude in notation with the carbonate ({{Chem|C|O|3|2\u2013}}) system. \n\nOne will also note that the NaOH and KOH species ([[alkali hydroxide]]s, also often simply called [[alkali]]) responsible for the silica dissolution in the alkali-silica reaction do not explicitly appear in this simplified representation of the ultimate reaction with portlandite, because they are continuously regenerated from the cation exchange reaction with portlandite. \n\n===Silica dissolution mechanism===\n\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Anhydrous and hydrated silica surface with [[siloxane]] and [[silanol]] groups along with surface bound water molecules.]]\n\nThe surface of solid silica in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH) sensitive to an alkaline attack by {{chem|OH|-}} ions. \n\nThe presence of these oxygen-bearing groups very prone to form [[hydrogen bond]]s with water molecules explains the affinity of silica for water and makes colloidal silica very [[hydrophile]]. \n\nSiloxane bonds may undergo [[hydrolysis]] and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] reactions as schematically represented hereafter: \n\n[[File:SiloxaneFxnlGp.png|100px|right|Siloxane bond between two silicon atoms.]]\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + HO\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|H|2|O}} &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; ={{chem|Si|(\u2013OH|)|2}}\n\n[[File:Silanol group.png|120px|right|Chemical structure of a [[silanol]] group.]]\n\nOn the other hand, [[silanol]] groups can also undergo [[protonation]]/deprotonation: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH &nbsp; \u2194 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|+}}.\n\nThese equilibria can be shifted towards the right side of the reaction leading to silica dissolution by increasing the concentration of [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>), i.e., by increasing the pH of the solution. \n\n[[Alkaline hydrolysis]] of siloxane bonds occurs by [[nucleophilic substitution]] of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> onto a silicon atom, while another <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si group is leaving to preserve the tetravalent character of Si atom:\n\n: \u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261 + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013OH + <sup>\u2013</sup>O\u2013Si\u2261\n: =Si=O + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; ={{chem|SiO|(OH|)|-}}\n\n[[Protonation|Deprotonation]] of [[silanol]] groups: \n: \u2261Si\u2013OH + {{chem|O|H|-}} &nbsp; \u2192 &nbsp; \u2261Si\u2013{{chem|O|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}.\n\nIn the pH range 0 \u2013 7, the solubility of silica is constant, but above pH 8, the hydrolysis of siloxane bonds and deprotonation of silanol groups exponentially increase with pH. This is why glass easily dissolves at high pH and does not withstand extremely basic NaOH/KOH solutions. Therefore, NaOH/KOH released during cement hydration attacks and dissolves the tridimensional network of silica present in the aggregates. Amorphous or poorly crystallized silica, as [[cryptocrystalline]] [[chalcedony]] or [[chert]] present in [[flint]]s (in [[chalk]]) or rolled river [[gravel]]s, is much more soluble and sensitive to alkaline attack by OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions than well crystallized silica such as [[quartz]]. Strained (deformed) quartz or chert exposed to [[frost weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles in Canada and [[Nordic countries]] are also more sensitive to alkaline (high pH) solutions. \n\nThe species responsible for silica dissolution is the [[hydroxide]] [[anion]] (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>). The high pH conditions are said to be [[Alkali#Alkali_salts|alkaline]] and one also speaks of the [[alkalinity]] of the basic solutions. For the sake of electroneutrality, (OH<sup>\u2013</sup>) anions need to be accompanied by positively charged cations, Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> in [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] solutions respectively. [[Sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] both belong to the [[alkali metal]]s column in the [[Mendeleev table]]. When speaking of alkali's, one systematically refers to NaOH and KOH basic hydroxides, or their corresponding oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O in cement. Therefore, it is the hydroxide, or the oxide, component of the salt which is the only relevant chemical species for silica dissolution, not the alkali metal in itself. However, to determine the alkali equivalent content (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>eq</sub>) in cement, because the need to maintain electroneutrality in solids or in solution, one directly measures the contents of cement in Na and K elements and one conservatively considers that their counter ions are the hydroxide ions. As Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> cations are hydrated species, they also contribute to retain water in alkali-silica reaction products.\n\n===Catalysis of ASR by dissolved NaOH or KOH===\n\nThe ASR reaction significantly differs from the pozzolanic reaction by the fact that it is catalysed by soluble [[alkali]] [[hydroxide]]s ([[NaOH]] / [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]) at very high pH. It can be represented as follows using the classical geochemical notation for representing silica by the fully hydrated dissolved silica (Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> or [[silicic acid]]: H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), but an older industrial notation also exists (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, hemihydrated silica (does not exist), by analogy with [[carbonic acid]]):\n\n:2 Na(OH) + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\n:the so-produced soluble alkali silicagel can then react with [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) to precipitate insoluble [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H phases) and regenerate NaOH for continuing the initial silica dissolution reaction: \n\n:Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}} + 2 NaOH\n\nThe sum, or the combination, of the two above mentioned reactions gives a general reaction resembling the pozzolanic reaction, but it is important to keep in mind that this reaction is catalysed by the undesirable presence in cement, or other concrete components, of soluble alkaline hydroxydes (NaOH / KOH) responsible for the dissolution of the silica (silicic acid) at high pH:\n\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CaH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>{{hydrate|2}}\n\nWithout the presence of dissolved NaOH or KOH, responsible for the high pH (~13.5) of the concrete pore water, the amorphous silica of the reactive aggregates would not be dissolved and the reaction would not evolve. Moreover, the soluble sodium or potassium silicate is very hygroscopic and swells when it absorbs water. When the sodium silicate gel forms and swells inside a porous siliceous aggregate, it first expands and occupies the free porosity. When this latter is completely filled, if the soluble but very viscous gel cannot be easily expelled from the silica network, the hydraulic pressure rises inside the attacked aggregate and leads to its fracture. It is the hydro-mechanical expansion of the damaged siliceous aggregate surrounded by calcium-rich hardened cement paste which is responsible for the development of a network of cracks in concrete. When the sodium silicate expelled from the aggregate encounters grains of portlandite present in the hardened cement paste, an exchange between sodium and calcium cations occurs and hydrated calcium silicate (C-S-H) precipitates with a concomitant release of NaOH. In its turn, the regenerated NaOH can react with the amorphous silica aggregate leading to an increased production of soluble sodium silicate. When a continuous rim of C-S-H completely envelops the external surface of the attacked siliceous aggregate, it behaves as a [[semi-permeable]] barrier and hinders the expulsion of the viscous sodium silicate while allowing the NaOH / KOH to diffuse from the hardened cement paste inside the aggregate. This selective barrier of C-S-H contributes to increase the hydraulic pressure inside the aggregate and aggravates the cracking process. It is the expansion of the aggregates which damages concrete in the alkali-silica reaction.\n\nPortlandite (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) represents the reserve of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions in the solid phase. As long as portlandite, or the siliceous aggregates, has not become completely exhausted, the ASR reaction will continue. The alkali hydroxides are continuously regenerated by the reaction of the sodium silicate with portlandite and thus represent the transmission belt of the ASR reaction driving it to completeness. It is thus impossible to interrupt the ASR reaction. The only way to avoid ASR in the presence of siliceous aggregates and water is to maintain the concentration of soluble alkali (NaOH and KOH) at the lowest possible level in concrete, so that the catalysis mechanism becomes negligible.\n\n===Analogy with the soda lime carbonation===\n\nThe alkali-silica reaction mechanism catalysed by a soluble [[strong base]] as NaOH or KOH in the presence of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (alkalinity buffer present in the solid phase) can be compared with the [[carbonation]] process of [[soda lime]]. The [[silicic acid]] ([[silicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[SiO2|SiO<sub>2</sub>]]) is simply replaced in the reaction by the [[carbonic acid]] ([[H2CO3|H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] or [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]).\n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(CO<sub>2</sub> trapping by soluble NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with lime)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | CO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction)\n|}\n\nIn the presence of water or simply [[relative humidity|ambient moisture]], the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily [[solubility|dissolve]] in their [[mineral hydration|hydration water]] ([[hygroscopic]] substances, [[deliquescence]] phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the [[catalysis]] process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase.<ref name=\"Samari_2019\">{{cite journal|last1=Samari|first1=Mohammad|last2=Ridha|first2=Firas|last3=Manovic|first3=Vasilije|last4=Macchi|first4=Arturo|last5=Anthony|first5=E.

This gives the following set of reactions also commonly encountered in the literature to schematically depict the continuous regeneration of NaOH in ASR: \n\n:{| border = 0\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (1)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH&nbsp; || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; &nbsp; || Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O|| &nbsp; ||(SiO<sub>2</sub> quickly dissolved by hygroscopic NaOH)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | (2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaOH || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(regeneration of NaOH after reaction with portlandite)\n|-\n| align = \"right\" | sum (1+2)|| &nbsp; || align = \"right\" | SiO<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> || &nbsp; || \u2192 || &nbsp; || CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O || &nbsp; &nbsp; ||(global reaction ressembling the [[Pozzolanic reaction]])\n|}\n\nIf NaOH is clearly deficient in the system under consideration (soda lime or alkali-silica reaction), it is formally possible to write the same reactions sets by simply replacing the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> anions by HSiO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, the principle of catalysis remaining the same, even if the number of intermediate species differs.\n\n===Main sources of {{chem|OH|-}} in hardened cement paste===\n\nOne can distinguish several sources of hydroxide anions ({{chem|OH|-}}) in hardened cement paste (HCP) from the family of [[Portland cement]] (pure [[Portland cement|OPC]], with [[Ground granulated blast-furnace slag|BFS]], or with cementitious additions, [[Fly ash|FA]] or [[Silica fume|SF]]). \n\n====Direct sources====\n\n{{chem|OH|-}} anions can be directly present in the HCP pore water or be slowly released from the solid phase (main buffer, or solid stock) by the dissolution of {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} (portlandite) when its solubility increases when high pH value starts to drop. Beside these two main sources, ions exchange reactions and precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salts can also contribute to release {{chem|OH|-}} into solution. \n\nAlkali hydroxides, NaOH and KOH, arise from the direct dissolution of {{chem|Na|2|O}} and {{chem|K|2|O}} oxides produced by the pyrolysis of the raw materials at high temperature (1450&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the [[cement kiln]]. The presence of minerals with high Na and K contents in the raw materials can thus be problematic. The ancient wet manufacturing process of cement, consuming more energy (water evaporation) that the modern dry process, had the advantage to eliminate much of the soluble Na and K salts present in the raw material. \n\nAs previously described in the two sections dealing respectively with ASR catalysis by alkali hydroxides and soda lime carbonation, soluble NaOH and KOH are continuously regenerated and released into solution when the soluble alkali silicate reacts with {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} to precipitate insoluble calcium silicate. Therefore, portlandite is the main buffer of {{chem|OH|-}} in the solid phase. As long as the stock of hydroxide in the solid phase is not exhausted, the alkali-silica reaction can continue to proceed until complete disparition of one of the reagents ({{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} or {{chem|Si|O|2}}) involved in the [[pozzolanic reaction]].\n\n====Indirect sources====\n\nThere exist also other indirect sources of {{chem|OH|-}}, all related to the presence of soluble Na and K salts in the pore water of hardened cement paste (HCP). \nThe first category contains soluble Na and K salts whose corresponding anions can precipitate an insoluble calcium salts, e.g., {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}, {{chem|Na|3|PO|4}}, {{chem|NaB|(OH)|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|B|4|O|7}}, ... . \n\nHereafter, an example for [[calcium sulfate]] ([[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]]) precipitation releasing [[sodium hydroxide]]: \n\n: {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} \u2192 {{chem|Ca|SO|4}} + 2 NaOH\n\nor, the reaction of [[sodium carbonate]] with portlandite, also important for the [[catalysis]] of the [[alkali\u2013carbonate reaction]] as emphasized by Fournier and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 (2000) and B\u00e9rub\u00e9 ''et al.''

So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)?\n\nBeside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) (the \"''glue''\" in cement paste), calcium sulfo-aluminate phases ([[AFm phase|AFm]] and AFt, [[ettringite]]) and [[hydrogarnet]]. C-S-H phases are less soluble (~&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>&nbsp;M) than portlandite (CH) (~&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;10<sup>-2</sup>&nbsp;M at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C) and therefore are expected to play a negligible role for the calcium ions release. \n\nAn anion-exchange reaction between chloride ions and the hydroxide anions contained in the lattice of some calcium aluminate hydrates (C-A-H), or related phases (C-A-S-H, AFm, AFt), is suspected to also contribute to the release of hydroxide anions into solution. The principle mechanism is schematically illustrated hereafter for C-A-H phases: \n\n: {{chem|Cl|-}} + (C-A-H)\u2013OH \u2192 (C-A-H)\u2013Cl + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nAs a simple, but robust, conclusion, the presence of soluble Na and K salts can also cause, by precipitation of poorly soluble calcium salt (with portlandite, CH) or anion exchange reactions (with phases related to C-A-H), the release of {{chem|OH|-}} anions into solution. Therefore, the presence of any salts of Na and K in cement pore water is undesirable and the measurements of Na and K elements is a good [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] ([[Indicator (statistics)|indicator]]) for the maximal concentration of {{chem|OH|-}} in pore solution. This is why the total alkali equivalent content ({{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}) of cement can simply rely on the measurements of [[sodium|Na]] and [[potassium|K]] (''e.g.'', by [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|ICP-AES]], [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|AAS]], [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] measurements techniques).\n\n===Alkali gel evolution and ageing===\n\nThe maturation process of the fluid alkali silicagel found in exudations into less soluble solid products found in gel pastes or in efflorescences is described hereafter. Four distinct steps are considered in this progressive transformation. \n\n1. {{chem|Si|O|2}} dissolution and {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} formation (here, explicitly written in the ancient industrial metasilicate notation (based on the non-existing [[metasilicic acid]], {{Chem|H|2|Si|O|3}}) to also illustrate the frequent use of this later in the literature): \n\n:2 NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} \u00b7 {{chem|H|2|O}}\n:this reaction is accompanied by hydration and swelling of the alkali gel leading to the expansion of the affected aggregates. The pH of the alkali gel is very high and it has often a characteristic amber color. The high pH of young alkali gel exudations often precludes the growth of mosses at the surface of concrete crack infilling.\n\n2. Maturation of the alkali gel: polymerisation and gelation by the [[sol\u2013gel process]]. Condensation of silicate [[monomer]]s or [[oligomer]]s dispersed in a [[colloid|colloidal solution]] (sol) into a biphasic aqueous polymeric network of silicagel. {{chem|Ca|2+}} divalent cations released by [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[portlandite]]) when the pH starts to slightly drop may influence the gelation process. \n\n3. Cation exchange with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) and precipitation of amorphous [[calcium silicate hydrate]]s (C-S-H) accompanied by NaOH regeneration: \n:{{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|Ca|(OH)|2}} &rarr; {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + 2 NaOH\n\n:Amorphous non-stoechiometric calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H, the non-stoechiometry being denoted here by the use of dashes) can recrystallize into [[Desert rose (crystal)|rosettes]] similar to these of [[gyrolite]]. \n\n4. Carbonation of the C-S-H leading to precipitation of calcium carbonate and amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> stylized as follows: \n: {{chem|Ca|Si|O|3}} + {{chem|CO|2}} &rarr; {{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}\n\nAs long as the alkali gel ({{chem|Na|2|Si|O|3}}) has not yet reacted with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions released from portlandite dissolution, it remains fluid and can easily exude from broken aggregates or through open cracks in the damage concrete structure. This can lead to visible yellow viscous liquid exudations (amber liquid droplets) at the surface of affected concrete. \n\nWhen pH slowly drops due to the progress of the silica dissolution reaction, solubility of calcium hydroxide increases and the alkali gel reacts with {{chem|Ca|2+}} ions. Its viscosity increases due to gelation process and its mobility (fluidity) strongly decreases when C-S-H phases start to precipitate after reaction with calcium hydroxide (portlandite). At this moment, the calcified gel becomes hard, hindering therefore the alkali gel transport in concrete. \n\nWhen the C-S-H gel is exposed to atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], it undergoes a rapid carbonation and white/yellow [[efflorescence]]s appear at the surface of concrete. When the relatively fluid alkali gel continue to exude below the hardened superficial gel layer, it pushes the efflorescences out of the crack surface making them to appear in relief. Because the gel drying and carbonation reactions rates are faster than the gel exudation velocity (liquid gel expulsion rate through open cracks), in most of the cases, fresh liquid alkali exudates are not frequently encounterered at the surface of civil engineering concrete structures. Decompressed concrete cores can sometimes let observe fresh yellow liquid alkali exudations (viscous amber droplets) just after their drilling.\n\n==Mechanism of concrete deterioration==\nThe mechanism of ASR causing the deterioration of concrete can thus be described in four steps as follows:\n# The very basic solution (NaOH / KOH) attacks the siliceous aggregates (silicic acid dissolution at high pH), converting the poorly crystallised or amorphous silica to a soluble but very viscous alkali silicate gel (N-S-H, K-S-H).\n# The consumption of NaOH / KOH by the dissolution reaction of amorphous silica decreases the pH of the pore water of the hardened cement paste. This allows the dissolution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (portandite) and increases the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cement pore water. Calcium ions then react with the soluble sodium silicate gel to convert it into solid calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). The C-S-H forms a continuous poorly permeable coating at the external surface of the aggregate.\n# The penetrated alkaline solution (NaOH / KOH) converts the remaining siliceous minerals into bulky soluble alkali silicate gel. The resulting expansive pressure increases in the core of the aggregate.\n# The accumulated pressure cracks the aggregate and the surrounding cement paste when the pressure exceeds the tolerance of the aggregate.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.06.008| last1 = Ichikawa| first1 = T.| last2 = Miura| first2 = M.| date = 2007| title = Modified model of alkali-silica reaction| journal = Cement and Concrete Research| volume = 37| issue = 9| pages = 1291\u20131297}}</ref>\n\n== Structural effects of ASR ==\nThe cracking caused by ASR can have several negative impacts on concrete, including:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/structural-effects-asr-concrete-structures|title=Structural Effects of ASR on Concrete Structures {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-10-28|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n# Expansion: The swelling nature of ASR gel increases the chance of expansion in concrete elements.\n# [[Compressive strength]]: The effect of ASR on compressive strength can be minor for low expansion levels, to relatively higher degrees at larger expansion. (Swamy R.N. 1986) points out that the compressive strength is not very accurate parameter to study the severity of ASR; however, the test is done because of its simplicity.\n# [[Tensile strength]] / Flexural capacity: Researches show that ASR cracking can significantly reduce the tensile strength of concrete; therefore reducing the flexural capacity of beams. Some research on bridge structures indicate about 85% loss of capacity as a result of ASR.\n# [[Modulus of elasticity]]/UPV: The effect of ASR on elastic properties of concrete and [[Ultrasonic pulse velocity test|ultrasound pulse velocity]] (UPV) is very similar to tensile capacity. The modulus of elasticity is shown to be more sensitive to ASR than pulse velocity.\n# [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]: ASR reduces the load [[bearing capacity]] and the fatigue life of concrete (Ahmed T. 2000).\n# [[Shear strength]]: ASR enhances the shear capacity of reinforced concrete with and without [[Shear wall|shear reinforcement]] (Ahmed T. 2000).\n\n==Mitigation==\nASR can be mitigated in new concrete by several complementary approaches:\n# ''Limit the alkali metal content of the cement''. Many standards impose limits on the \"Equivalent Na<sub>2</sub>O\" content of cement.\n# ''Limit the reactive silica content of the aggregate''. Certain volcanic rocks are particularly susceptible to ASR because they contain volcanic glass ([[obsidian]]) and should not be used as aggregate. The use of [[calcium carbonate]] aggregates is sometimes envisaged as an ultimate solution to avoid any problem. However, while it may be considered as a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient one. In principle, [[limestone]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is not expected to contain a high level of silica, but it actually depends on its purity. Indeed, some siliceous limestones (a.o., ''[[Kieselkalk]]'' found in [[Switzerland]])<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Funk|first=Hanspeter|year=1975|title=The origin of authigenic quartz in the Helvetic Siliceous Limestone (Helvetischer Kieselkalk), Switzerland|journal=Sedimentology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=299\u2013306|bibcode=1975Sedim..22..299F|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1975.tb00296.x}}<!--| accessdate = 2009-03-17\n--></ref> may be cemented by amorphous or poorly crystalline silica and can be very sensitive to the ASR reaction, as also observed with some Tournaisian siliceous limestones exploited in quarries in the area of [[Tournai]] in [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Monnin\n| first = Y.\n|author2=D\u00e9grugilliers P. |author3=Bulteel D. |author4=Garcia-Diaz E.\n | year = 2006\n| title = Petrography study of two siliceous limestones submitted to alkali-silica reaction\n| journal = Cement and Concrete Research\n| volume = 36\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1460\u20131466\n| issn = 0008-8846\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.025\n}}</ref> In Canada, the Spratt siliceous limestone is also particularly well known in studies dealing with ASR and is commonly used as the Canadian ASR reference aggregate.

A prompt reaction initiated at the early stage of concrete hardening on very fine silica particles will help to suppress a slow and delayed reaction with larger siliceous aggregates on the long term. Following the same principle, the fabrication of low-pH cement also implies the addition of finely divided pozzolanic materials rich in silicic acid to the concrete mix to decrease its alkalinity. Beside initially lowering the pH value of the concrete pore water, the main working mechanism of silica fume addition is to consume portlandite (the reservoir of hydroxyde (OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>) in the solid phase) and to decrease the porosity of the hardened cement paste by the formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). However, silica fume has to be very finely dispersed in the concrete mix, because agglomerated flakes of compacted silica fume can themselves also induce ASR if the dispersion process is insufficient. This can be the case in laboratory studies made on cement pastes alone in the absence of aggregates. However, most often, in large concrete batches, silica fume is sufficiently dispersed during mixing operations of fresh concrete by the presence of coarse and fine aggregates.\n\nAs part of a study conducted by the [[Federal Highway Administration]], a variety of methods have been applied to field structures suffering from ASR-affected expansion and cracking. Some methods, such as the application of [[silane]]s, have shown significant promise, especially when applied to elements such as small columns and highway barriers, whereas other methods, such as the topical application of [[lithium]] compounds, have shown little or no promise in reducing ASR-induced expansion and cracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pub_details.cfm?id=894|title=Publication Details for Alkali-Aggregate Reactivity (AAR) Facts Book - Pavements - FHWA|work=dot.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Curative treatment==\nThere are no curative treatments in general for ASR affected structures. Repair in damaged sections is possible, but the reaction will continue. In some cases, when a sufficient drying of thin components (walls, slabs) of a structure is possible, and is followed by the installation of a [[Waterproofing|watertight]] [[Synthetic membrane|membrane]], the evolution of the reaction can be slow down, and sometimes stopped, because the lack of water to continue to fuel the reaction. Indeed, water plays a triple role in the alkali-silica reaction: solvent for the reaction taking place, transport medium for the dissolved species reacting, and finally also reagent consumed by the reaction itself. \n\nHowever, concrete at the center of thick concrete components or structures can never dry because water transport in saturated or unsaturated conditions is always limited by diffusion in the concrete pores (water present under the liquid form, or under the vapor state). The water diffusion time is thus proportional to the square of its transport distance. As a consequence, the water saturation degree inside thick concrete structures often remains higher than 80&nbsp;%, a level sufficient to provide enough water to the system and to maintain the alkali-silica reaction on going. \n\nMassive structures such as dams pose particular problems: they cannot be easily replaced, and the swelling can block [[spillway]] gates or [[turbine]] operations. Cutting slots across the structure can relieve some pressure, and help restore geometry and function.\n\n==Prevention of the risk==\nThe only way to prevent, or to limit, the risk of ASR is to avoid one or several of the three elements in the critical triangle aggregate reactivity \u2013 cement alkali content \u2013 water: \n* by selecting non-reactive aggregates after testing them according to an appropriate standard test method (see next section); \n* by using a low-alkali (LA) cement: with a maximum alkali content expressed in {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}} < 0.60&nbsp;% of the cement mass, according to EN&nbsp;197-1 European standard for cement,<ref name=\"EN197_1\">EN&nbsp;197-1 European Standard. Cement \u2013 Part 1: Composition, specifications and conformity criteria for common cements.</ref> or by limiting the total alkali content in concrete (''e.g.'', less than 3&nbsp;kg {{chem|Na|2|O|eq}}/m<sup>3</sup> of concrete for a CEM&nbsp;I cement (OPC)). Example of standard for concrete in Belgium: NBN EN 206 and its national supplement NBN B 15-001<ref name=\"EN_206\">NBN EN 206:2013+A1:2016 Concrete \u2013 Specification, performance, production and conformity.

Publication date: 07/2018. </ref>; \n* by limiting the contact of underground or meteoritic water infiltrations with the concrete structure (water tight membrane, roofing, sufficient water drainage, ...). This last precaution is always advisable when possible and the only one also sometimes applicable for existing ASR-affected concrete structures.\n\n==Methods for testing potential alkali reactivity==\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) has developed different standardized test methods for screening aggregates for their susceptibility to ASR:\n* ASTM C227: \u201cTest Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Cement-Aggregate Combinations (Mortar-Bar Method)\u201d\n* ASTM C289: \"Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Aggregates (Chemical Method)\"\n* ASTM C295: \u201cGuide for Petrographic Examination of Aggregate for Concrete\u201d\n* ASTM C1260: \u201cTest Method for Potential Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar-Test)\u201d. It is a rapid test of aggregates: immersion of mortar bars in NaOH 1 M at 80 \u00b0C for 14 days used to quickly identify highly reactive aggregates or quasi non-reactive aggregates. Beside an elevated temperature, the C1260 method also involves the use of a large quantity/inventory of NaOH in the solution in which the mortar bar is immersed. A large pool of OH<sup>\u2013</sup> anions is thus available to diffuse inside the mortar bar to dissolve silica present in aggregates. Consequently, this test is very severe and may exclude valuable aggregates. In case of non-decisive results, the long-term ASTM C1293 test method has to be used for a final screening. The main advantage of the ASTM C1260 test is that it allows to quickly identify extreme cases: very insensitive or very reactive aggregates. \n* ASTM C1293: \u201cTest Method for Concrete Aggregates by Determination of Length Change of Concrete Due to Alkali-Silica Reaction\u201d. It is a long-term confirmation test (1 or 2 years) at 38 \u00b0C in a water-saturated moist atmosphere (inside a thermostated oven) with concrete prisms containing the aggregates to be characterised mixed with a high-alkali cement specially selected to induce ASR. The concrete prisms are not directly immersed in an alkaline solution, but wrapped with moist tissues and tightly packed inside a water-tight plastic foils. \n* ASTM C1567: \"Standard Test Method for Determining the Potential Alkali-Silica Reactivity of Combinations of Cementitious Materials and Aggregate (Accelerated Mortar-Bar Method)\"\n\nOther concrete prism methods have also been internationally developed to detect potential alkali-reactivity of aggregates or sometimes hardened concrete cores, ''e.g.'':\n* The Oberholster method on which the ASTM C1260 test is based. \n* The Dungan method with superimposed additional thermal cycles. \n* The concrete microbar test was proposed by Grattan-Bellew ''et al.''

Produced by [[Jerry Finn]], the album was released May 21, 2002 through [[MCA Records]]. The band was a side-project of [[Blink-182]] members [[Tom DeLonge]] and [[Travis Barker]], with [[David Kennedy (guitarist)|David Kennedy]] completing the band's studio lineup; a bassist and friend of Barker, Anthony Celestino, toured with the band throughout late 2002. The record was the only studio effort the trio produced together, and was recorded over the course of six weeks in late 2001.\n\nThe record is primarily based on DeLonge's [[post-hardcore]] influences, such as [[Fugazi]] and [[Refused]]. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for him, as he had recently undergone back surgery. The record is a [[concept album]] detailing the end of the world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist [[Mark Hoppus]]\u2014the only member of that band not involved in the project\u2014felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup. However, Hoppus himself did provide guest vocals on the album's twelfth track \"Elevator\".\n\n''Box Car Racer'' peaked at number twelve on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] despite little promotion, and the two singles \"[[I Feel So]]\" and \"[[There Is]]\" charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, with the former hitting the top 10. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented the darker direction in comparison to DeLonge's previous work with Blink. The group toured the album in North America in late 2002 with [[the Used]] and [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]. The album was conceived as an experiment of sorts; as such, the band dissolved after the tour.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tom DeLonge 2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tom DeLonge conceived the project during a break from touring.]]\nBox Car Racer was conceived by [[Blink-182]] guitarist/vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]] and formed during a break from touring. The trio's European tour in the winter of 2001 was delayed in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's back problems, the result of a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]].<ref name=\"endofworld\"/> He began taking [[painkillers]] and developed \"[[neurosis]]-inducing side effects.\"<ref name=k!/> DeLonge had felt \"bummed out\" and creatively stifled while recording the group's previous album, ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]''.<ref name=totalguitar/> On the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer [[Travis Barker]] would jam \"every day,\" and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music.  DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like [[Fugazi]], [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], [[Rocket from the Crypt]], and [[Pitchfork (band)|Pitchfork]].{{sfn|Barker and Edwards|2015|p=163}} He began writing heavier-sounding [[Ostinato#Riff|guitar riff]]s; the first riff he created became part of the song \"All Systems Go\".<ref name=totalguitar/> Barker, in his 2015 memoir ''Can I Say'', maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. \"I honestly thought that Tom had already had a conversation with [bassist Mark Hoppus] about this.

Produced by [[Jerry Finn]], the album was released May 21, 2002 through [[MCA Records]]. The band was a side-project of [[Blink-182]] members [[Tom DeLonge]] and [[Travis Barker]], with [[David Kennedy (guitarist)|David Kennedy]] completing the band's studio lineup; a bassist and friend of Barker, Anthony Celestino, toured with the band throughout late 2002. The record was the only studio effort the trio produced together, and was recorded over the course of six weeks in late 2001.\n\nThe record is primarily based on DeLonge's [[post-hardcore]] influences, such as [[Fugazi]] and [[Refused]]. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for him, as he had recently undergone back surgery. The record is a [[concept album]] detailing the end of the world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist [[Mark Hoppus]]\u2014the only member of that band not involved in the project\u2014felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup. However, Hoppus himself did provide guest vocals on the album's twelfth track \"Elevator\".\n\n''Box Car Racer'' peaked at number twelve on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] despite little promotion, and the two singles \"[[I Feel So]]\" and \"[[There Is]]\" charted on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, with the former hitting the top 10. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented the darker direction in comparison to DeLonge's previous work with Blink. The group toured the album in North America in late 2002 with [[the Used]] and [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]. The album was conceived as an experiment of sorts; as such, the band dissolved after the tour.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tom DeLonge 2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tom DeLonge conceived the project during a break from touring.]]\nBox Car Racer was conceived by [[Blink-182]] guitarist/vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]] and formed during a break from touring. The trio's European tour in the winter of 2001 was delayed in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge's back problems, the result of a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]].<ref name=\"endofworld\"/> He began taking [[painkillers]] and developed \"[[neurosis]]-inducing side effects.\"<ref name=k!/> DeLonge had felt \"bummed out\" and creatively stifled while recording the group's previous album, ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]''.<ref name=totalguitar/> On the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer [[Travis Barker]] would jam \"every day,\" and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music.  DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like [[Fugazi]], [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], [[Rocket from the Crypt]], and [[Pitchfork (band)|Pitchfork]].{{sfn|Barker and Edwards|2015|p=163}} He began writing heavier-sounding [[Ostinato#Riff|guitar riff]]s; the first riff he created became part of the song \"All Systems Go\".<ref name=totalguitar/> Barker, in his 2015 memoir ''Can I Say'', maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. \"I honestly thought that Tom had already had a conversation with [bassist Mark Hoppus] about this.
