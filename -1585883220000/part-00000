One study finds that, \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

One study finds that, \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses.\"<ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|title = Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal = Demography|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 0070-3370|pages = 739\u2013763|volume = 46|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/dem.0.0076|pmid = 20084827|first = Carolyn|last = Moehling|first2 = Anne Morrison|last2 = Piehl|pmc = 2831353}}</ref>\n\nFor the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had \"quite similar\" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for major crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930.<ref name=\":28\" /> Contemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable ways.<ref name=\":28\" /> A study by Harvard economist [[Nathan Nunn]], Yale economist [[Nancy Qian]] and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131920) had no long-run effects on crime rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Sandra|last2=Nunn|first2=Nathan|last3=Qian|first3=Nancy|date=March 2017 |title=Migrants and the Making of America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Immigration during the Age of Mass Migration |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23289 |doi=10.3386/w23289 }}</ref>\n\n==== Terrorism ====\nAccording to a review by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fact-checker of the available research and evidence, there is nothing to support President Trump's claim that \"the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.\"<ref name=\":48\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/15/president-trumps-claim-that-foreigners-comprise-the-vast-majority-of-terrorism-convictions-since-911/|title=Analysis {{!}} President Trump's claim that foreigners are responsible for 'the vast majority' of terrorism convictions since 9/11|last=|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> The fact-checker noted that the Government Accountability Office had found that \"of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since Sept. 12, 2001, 73 percent (62) were committed by far-right-wing violent extremist groups, and 27 percent (23) by radical Islamist violent extremists\".<ref name=\":48\" /> A bulletin by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security also warned in May 2017 that white supremacist groups were \u201cresponsible for a lion\u2019s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups\".<ref name=\":48\" /> According to a report by the [[New America (organization)|New America]] foundation, of the individuals credibly involved in radical Islamist-inspired activity in the United States since 9/11, the large majority were US-born citizens, not immigrants.<ref name=\":48\" />\n\nA 2018 paper found no statistically significant evidence that refugee settlements in the United States are linked to terrorism events.<ref name=\":54\" />\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\n{{Further|Immigration to Australia|Crime in Australia}}\n\nA 2019 study found no impact of immigration on crime rates in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sydes|first=Michelle|date=2019-09-18|title=Immigration, Ethnicity, and Neighborhood Violence: Considering Both Concentration and Diversity Effects|journal=Race and Justice|language=en-US|pages=215336871987518|doi=10.1177/2153368719875183|issn=2153-3687}}</ref> Foreigners are under-represented in the Australian prison population, according to 2010 figures.<ref name=\":34\" /> A 1987 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that studies had consistently found that migrant populations in Australia had lower crime rates than the Australian-born population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/archive/migration-ethnicity-and-crime-in-australian-society|title=Migration, ethnicity and crime in Australian society|last=Hazlehurst|first=Kayleen|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe alleged link between immigration and criminality has been a longstanding meme in Australian history with many of the original immigrants being convicts. During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.<ref name=\"Taycc\">{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|work=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref> A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

The virus is primarily spread between people through close contact and via [[respiratory droplets]] produced from coughs or sneezes.<ref name=\"WHO2020QA\" /><ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /> It [[Viral

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2]]\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS).

[[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

{"title_page": "History of surfing", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2015}}\nThe riding of [[wind waves|waves]] has likely existed since humans began swimming in the [[ocean]]. In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].\n\n[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]\n\n== Polynesian origins ==\nThe art of surfing, known as ''he\u02bbe \u02bbana'' (''he\u02bbe'' means ''to surf'', and ''\u02bbana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\n== Pre-Incan Per\u00fa origins and debate ==\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\n==Ancient Hawaii==\nThe [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>\nSome ancient sites still popular today include [[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] and [[Holualoa Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/kic_brochure.pdf |title=Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Kulana Wahi pana - Restoring Sacred Places |publisher=brochure published by Kamehameha Investment Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Contact Hawaii ==\nAfter [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]].

Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\n\nIt was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\n\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==North America==\n\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California.

Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.\n\n[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n==Professional surfing==\n\nDefining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\n\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\n\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\n\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.\n\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\n[[File:Professional_surfing.jpg|thumb|A surfer dropping in]]\n\n==Technological innovations in surfing==\n\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\n\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\n\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\n[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]\n\n===The Short Board Revolution===\n\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\n\nThroughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\n\n==Style versus performance==\n\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\n\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\n\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\n\n==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==\n\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\n\nIn America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\n\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.\n\n==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==\n\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.\n\n[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.\nThe Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;General\n*Quinn, Richard. \"Region's First Surfboard Evokes a Wave of Nostalgia\" The Virginian Pilot.

In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].\n\n[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]\n\n== Polynesian origins ==\nThe art of surfing, known as ''he\u02bbe \u02bbana'' (''he\u02bbe'' means ''to surf'', and ''\u02bbana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\n== Pre-Incan Per\u00fa origins and debate ==\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\n==Ancient Hawaii==\nThe [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>\nSome ancient sites still popular today include [[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] and [[Holualoa Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/kic_brochure.pdf |title=Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Kulana Wahi pana - Restoring Sacred Places |publisher=brochure published by Kamehameha Investment Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Contact Hawaii ==\nAfter [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]].

Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\n\nIt was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\n\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==North America==\n\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California.

Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.\n\n[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n==Professional surfing==\n\nDefining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\n\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\n\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\n\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.\n\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\n[[File:Professional_surfing.jpg|thumb|A surfer dropping in]]\n\n==Technological innovations in surfing==\n\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\n\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\n\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\n[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]\n\n===The Short Board Revolution===\n\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\n\nThroughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\n\n==Style versus performance==\n\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\n\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\n\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\n\n==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==\n\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\n\nIn America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\n\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.\n\n==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==\n\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to design wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.\n\n[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.\nThe Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;General\n*Quinn, Richard. \"Region's First Surfboard Evokes a Wave of Nostalgia\" The Virginian Pilot.

He was previously the [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary]] of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 1997 to 2008, [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Tulle]] from 2001 to 2008, and President of the [[Corr\u00e8ze General Council]] from 2008 to 2012. Hollande also served in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly of France]] twice for the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Corr\u00e8ze]]'s [[Corr\u00e8ze's 1st constituency|1st]] constituency from 1988 to 1993, and again from 1997 to 2012.\n\nBorn in [[Rouen]] and raised in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Hollande began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], before serving as a staffer for [[Max Gallo]], the government's spokesman. He became a member of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] in 1988 and was elected First Secretary of the Socialist Party in 1997. Following the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]] won by the Socialists, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace [[Jean-Pierre Dupont]] as President of the [[Departmental council (France)|General Council]] of Corr\u00e8ze in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|primary election]] to select the Socialist Party presidential nominee; he won the nomination and was [[2012 French presidential election|elected]] President of France on 6 May 2012 during the second round of voting with 51.6% of the vote against incumbent [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n\nDuring his tenure, Hollande legalised [[Same-sex marriage in France|same-sex marriage]] by passing [[Law 2013-404|Bill no. 344]], reformed [[El Khomri law|labour laws]] and credit training programmes, withdrew French combat troops [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|present in the Afghanistan military intervention]]<ref name=\"guardianAC1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> and concluded a [[EU Directive 2010/63/EU|EU directive]] through a [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German contract]].

He was quickly spotted by [[Jacques Attali]], a senior adviser to Mitterrand, who arranged for Hollande to run in [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election of 1981]] in [[Corr\u00e8ze]] against future President [[Jacques Chirac]], who was then the leader of the [[Rally for the Republic]], a [[Neo-Gaullist]] party. Hollande lost to Chirac in the first round.\n\nHe went on to become a special advisor to newly elected President Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for [[Max Gallo]], the government's spokesman. After becoming a municipal [[councillor]] for [[Ussel, Corr\u00e8ze|Ussel]] in 1983, he contested Corr\u00e8ze for a second time in [[1988 French legislative election|1988]], this time being elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. Hollande lost his bid for re-election to the Assembly in the so-called \"blue wave\" of the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 election]], described as such due to the number of seats gained by the Right at the expense of the Socialist Party.\n\n===First Secretary of the Socialist Party (1997\u20132008)===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Hollande2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2005]]\nAs the end of Mitterrand's term in office approached, the Socialist Party was torn by a struggle of internal factions, each seeking to influence the direction of the party. Hollande pleaded for reconciliation and for the party to unite behind [[Jacques Delors]], the [[President of the European Commission]], but Delors renounced his ambitions to run for the French presidency in [[1995 French presidential election|1995]]. Former party leader [[Lionel Jospin]] resumed his position, and selected Hollande to become the official party spokesman. Hollande went on to contest Corr\u00e8ze once again in [[1997 French legislative election|1997]], successfully returning to the National Assembly.\n\nThat same year, Jospin became the [[Prime Minister of France]], and Hollande won the election for his successor as [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary]] of the party, a position he would hold for eleven years. Because of the very strong position of the Socialist Party within the [[French government]] during this period, Hollande's position led some to refer to him the \"Vice Prime Minister\". Hollande would go on to be elected [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Tulle]] in 2001, an office he would hold for the next seven years.\n\nThe immediate resignation of Jospin from politics following his shock defeat by far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in the first round of the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] forced Hollande to become the public face of the party for the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 legislative election]]. Although he managed to limit defeats and was re-elected in [[Corr\u00e8ze's 1st Constituency|his own constituency]], the Socialists lost nationally. In order to prepare for the 2003 party congress in [[Dijon]], he obtained the support of many notable personalities of the party and was re-elected first secretary against opposition from left-wing factions.\n\nAfter the triumph of the Left in the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but the Socialists were divided on the [[European Constitution]], and Hollande's support for the ill-fated \"Yes\" position in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|French referendum on the European constitution]] caused friction within the party. Although Hollande was re-elected as first secretary at the [[Le Mans Congress]] in 2005, his authority over the party began to decline. Eventually his domestic partner, [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], was chosen to represent the party in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], where she would lose to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n\nHollande was widely blamed for the poor performances of the Socialist Party in the [[2007 French legislative election|2007 elections]], and he announced that he would not seek another term as First Secretary. Hollande publicly declared his support for [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]], the [[mayor of Paris]], but it was [[Martine Aubry]] who would go on to win the race to succeed him in 2008. Hollande was next elected to replace [[Jean-Pierre Dupont]] as the president of the [[Corr\u00e8ze General Council|General Council of Corr\u00e8ze]] in April 2008, and won re-election in 2011.\n\n===2012 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Fran\u00e7ois Hollande presidential campaign, 2012}}\n{{See also|French presidential election, 2012}}\nHollande announced in early 2011 that he would be a candidate in the upcoming [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|primary election]] to select the Socialist and [[Radical Left Party]] presidential nominee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Albinet|first=Alain|title=L'appel de Tulle de Fran\u00e7ois Hollande|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/03/31/l-appel-de-tulle-de-francois-hollande_1501495_823448.html|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|date=31 March 2011|language=French}}</ref> The primary marked the first time that both parties had held an open primary to select a joint nominee at the same time. He initially trailed the front-runner, former finance minister and [[International Monetary Fund]] managing director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]. Following Strauss-Kahn's [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case|arrest on suspicion of sexual assault]] in New York City in May 2011, Hollande began to lead the opinion polls, and his position as front-runner was established just as Strauss-Kahn declared that he would no longer seek the nomination. After a series of televised debates with other candidates throughout September, Hollande topped the ballot in the first round held on 9 October with 39% of the vote. He did not, however, gain the 50% required to avoid a [[run-off election]], and was obliged to enter a second ballot against [[Martine Aubry]], who had come in second with 30% of the vote.\n\nThe second ballot took place on 16 October 2011. Hollande won with 56% of the vote to Aubry's 43% and thus became the official Socialist and Radical Left Party candidate for the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=French Unions in National Strike on Pensions |first=Steven |last=Erlanger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/world/europe/08france.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 September 2010 |page=A4 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |quote=[Socialist party leader Martine] Aubry has presidential ambitions...

Legislation was introduced in late 2012 and after much debate passed the French lower and upper house in May 2013. The bill includes measures such as making it easier for workers to change jobs and for companies to fire employees. One of the main measures of the bill allows companies to temporarily cut workers' salaries or hours during times of economic difficulty. This measure takes its inspiration from Germany, where furloughs have been credited with allowing companies to weather difficult times without resorting to massive layoffs. Layoffs in France are often challenged in courts and the cases can take years to resolve. Many companies cite the threat of lengthy court action&nbsp;\u2013 even more than any financial cost \u2013 as the most difficult part of doing business in France. The law shortens the time that employees have to contest a layoff and also lays out a scheme for severance pay. The government hopes this will help employees and companies reach agreement faster in contentious layoffs.<ref name=labour>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/france-approves-major-labor-reform-package-160144959.html |title= France approves major labor reform package|author=Dilorenzo, Sarah|work=yahoo.com |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref>\n \nAnother key measure introduced are credits for training that follow employees throughout their career, regardless of where they work, and the right to take a leave of absence to work at another company. The law will also require all companies to offer and partially pay for supplemental health insurance. Lastly, the law also reforms unemployment insurance, so that someone out of work doesn't risk foregoing significant benefits when taking a job that might pay less than previous work or end up only being temporary. Under the new law, workers will be able to essentially put benefits on hold when they take temporary work, instead of seeing their benefits recalculated each time.<ref name=labour/>\n\n===Pension reform===\nAs President, Hollande pursued reform to the pension system in France. The process proved to be very contentious, with members of Parliament, Labor Unions, and general public all opposed. Mass protests and demonstrations occurred throughout Paris. Despite the opposition, the French Parliament did pass a reform in December 2013 aimed at plugging a pension deficit expected to reach 20.7 billion euros ($28.4 billion) by 2020 if nothing were to be done. Rather than raising the mandatory retirement age, as many economists had advised, Hollande pursued increases in contributions, leaving the retirement age untouched. The reform had a rough ride in parliament, being rejected twice by the Senate, where Hollande's Socialist Party has a slim majority, before it won sufficient backing in a final vote before the lower house of parliament. French private sector workers will see the size and duration of their pension contributions increase only modestly under the reform while their retirement benefits are largely untouched.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20393182/french-parliament-approves-pension-reform/ |title=French parliament approves pension reform |agency=Reuters |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104203944/http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20393182/french-parliament-approves-pension-reform/ |archivedate=4 January 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{see also|List of presidential trips made by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande}}\n[[File:Francois Hollande Bastille Day 2013 Paris t101747.jpg|thumb|Hollande reviewing troops during the 2013 [[Bastille Day military parade]]]]\nAs President, Hollande promised an early withdrawal of French combat troops present in Afghanistan in 2012.<ref name=guardianAC1/><ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|last=Fouquet |first=Helene |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-26/sarkozy-rival-hollande-may-seek-bank-split-in-election-platform.html |title=Socialist Hollande Pledges Tax Breaks End, Eased Pension Measure |publisher=Bloomberg |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> He also pledged to conclude a new contract of [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German partnership]], advocating the adoption of a [[European Directive|Directive]] on the protection of public services.

member|ex officio]]'' [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince of Andorra]] from 2012 to 2017. He was previously the [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary]] of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 1997 to 2008, [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Tulle]] from 2001 to 2008, and President of the [[Corr\u00e8ze General Council]] from 2008 to 2012. Hollande also served in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly of France]] twice for the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Corr\u00e8ze]]'s [[Corr\u00e8ze's 1st constituency|1st]] constituency from 1988 to 1993, and again from 1997 to 2012.\n\nBorn in [[Rouen]] and raised in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Hollande began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], before serving as a staffer for [[Max Gallo]], the government's spokesman. He became a member of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] in 1988 and was elected First Secretary of the Socialist Party in 1997. Following the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]] won by the Socialists, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace [[Jean-Pierre Dupont]] as President of the [[Departmental council (France)|General Council]] of Corr\u00e8ze in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|primary election]] to select the Socialist Party presidential nominee; he won the nomination and was [[2012 French presidential election|elected]] President of France on 6 May 2012 during the second round of voting with 51.6% of the vote against incumbent [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n\nDuring his tenure, Hollande legalised [[Same-sex marriage in France|same-sex marriage]] by passing [[Law 2013-404|Bill no. 344]], reformed [[El Khomri law|labour laws]] and credit training programmes, withdrew French combat troops [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|present in the Afghanistan military intervention]]<ref name=\"guardianAC1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> and concluded a [[EU Directive 2010/63/EU|EU directive]] through a [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German contract]]. Hollande led the country through the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|January]] and [[November 2015 Paris attacks|November 2015 Paris]] and [[2016 Nice attack]]s. He was a leading proponent of [[European migrant crisis|EU mandatory migrant quotas]] and [[NATO]]'s 2011 [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]]. He also sent troops to [[Mali]] and the [[Central African Republic]] with the approval of the UN Security Council in order to stabilise those countries, two operations largely seen as successful.

He was quickly spotted by [[Jacques Attali]], a senior adviser to Mitterrand, who arranged for Hollande to run in [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election of 1981]] in [[Corr\u00e8ze]] against future President [[Jacques Chirac]], who was then the leader of the [[Rally for the Republic]], a [[Neo-Gaullist]] party. Hollande lost to Chirac in the first round.\n\nHe went on to become a special advisor to newly elected President Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for [[Max Gallo]], the government's spokesman. After becoming a municipal [[councillor]] for [[Ussel, Corr\u00e8ze|Ussel]] in 1983, he contested Corr\u00e8ze for a second time in [[1988 French legislative election|1988]], this time being elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. Hollande lost his bid for re-election to the Assembly in the so-called \"blue wave\" of the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 election]], described as such due to the number of seats gained by the Right at the expense of the Socialist Party.\n\n===First Secretary of the Socialist Party (1997\u20132008)===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Hollande2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2005]]\nAs the end of Mitterrand's term in office approached, the Socialist Party was torn by a struggle of internal factions, each seeking to influence the direction of the party. Hollande pleaded for reconciliation and for the party to unite behind [[Jacques Delors]], the [[President of the European Commission]], but Delors renounced his ambitions to run for the French presidency in [[1995 French presidential election|1995]]. Former party leader [[Lionel Jospin]] resumed his position, and selected Hollande to become the official party spokesman. Hollande went on to contest Corr\u00e8ze once again in [[1997 French legislative election|1997]], successfully returning to the National Assembly.\n\nThat same year, Jospin became the [[Prime Minister of France]], and Hollande won the election for his successor as [[First Secretary of the French Socialist Party|First Secretary]] of the party, a position he would hold for eleven years. Because of the very strong position of the Socialist Party within the [[French government]] during this period, Hollande's position led some to refer to him the \"Vice Prime Minister\". Hollande would go on to be elected [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Tulle]] in 2001, an office he would hold for the next seven years.\n\nThe immediate resignation of Jospin from politics following his shock defeat by far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in the first round of the [[2002 French presidential election|2002 presidential election]] forced Hollande to become the public face of the party for the [[2002 French legislative election|2002 legislative election]]. Although he managed to limit defeats and was re-elected in [[Corr\u00e8ze's 1st Constituency|his own constituency]], the Socialists lost nationally. In order to prepare for the 2003 party congress in [[Dijon]], he obtained the support of many notable personalities of the party and was re-elected first secretary against opposition from left-wing factions.\n\nAfter the triumph of the Left in the [[2004 French regional elections|2004 regional elections]], Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but the Socialists were divided on the [[European Constitution]], and Hollande's support for the ill-fated \"Yes\" position in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|French referendum on the European constitution]] caused friction within the party. Although Hollande was re-elected as first secretary at the [[Le Mans Congress]] in 2005, his authority over the party began to decline. Eventually his domestic partner, [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], was chosen to represent the party in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 presidential election]], where she would lose to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].\n\nHollande was widely blamed for the poor performances of the Socialist Party in the [[2007 French legislative election|2007 elections]], and he announced that he would not seek another term as First Secretary. Hollande publicly declared his support for [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]], the [[mayor of Paris]], but it was [[Martine Aubry]] who would go on to win the race to succeed him in 2008. Hollande was next elected to replace [[Jean-Pierre Dupont]] as the president of the [[Corr\u00e8ze General Council|General Council of Corr\u00e8ze]] in April 2008, and won re-election in 2011.\n\n===2012 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Fran\u00e7ois Hollande presidential campaign, 2012}}\n{{See also|French presidential election, 2012}}\nHollande announced in early 2011 that he would be a candidate in the upcoming [[French Socialist Party presidential primary, 2011|primary election]] to select the Socialist and [[Radical Left Party]] presidential nominee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Albinet|first=Alain|title=L'appel de Tulle de Fran\u00e7ois Hollande|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/03/31/l-appel-de-tulle-de-francois-hollande_1501495_823448.html|accessdate=29 June 2011|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|date=31 March 2011|language=French}}</ref> The primary marked the first time that both parties had held an open primary to select a joint nominee at the same time. He initially trailed the front-runner, former finance minister and [[International Monetary Fund]] managing director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]. Following Strauss-Kahn's [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case|arrest on suspicion of sexual assault]] in New York City in May 2011, Hollande began to lead the opinion polls, and his position as front-runner was established just as Strauss-Kahn declared that he would no longer seek the nomination. After a series of televised debates with other candidates throughout September, Hollande topped the ballot in the first round held on 9 October with 39% of the vote. He did not, however, gain the 50% required to avoid a [[run-off election]], and was obliged to enter a second ballot against [[Martine Aubry]], who had come in second with 30% of the vote.\n\nThe second ballot took place on 16 October 2011.

Legislation was introduced in late 2012 and after much debate passed the French lower and upper house in May 2013. The bill includes measures such as making it easier for workers to change jobs and for companies to fire employees. One of the main measures of the bill allows companies to temporarily cut workers' salaries or hours during times of economic difficulty. This measure takes its inspiration from Germany, where furloughs have been credited with allowing companies to weather difficult times without resorting to massive layoffs. Layoffs in France are often challenged in courts and the cases can take years to resolve. Many companies cite the threat of lengthy court action&nbsp;\u2013 even more than any financial cost \u2013 as the most difficult part of doing business in France. The law shortens the time that employees have to contest a layoff and also lays out a scheme for severance pay. The government hopes this will help employees and companies reach agreement faster in contentious layoffs.<ref name=labour>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/france-approves-major-labor-reform-package-160144959.html |title= France approves major labor reform package|author=Dilorenzo, Sarah|work=yahoo.com |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref>\n \nAnother key measure introduced are credits for training that follow employees throughout their career, regardless of where they work, and the right to take a leave of absence to work at another company. The law will also require all companies to offer and partially pay for supplemental health insurance. Lastly, the law also reforms unemployment insurance, so that someone out of work doesn't risk foregoing significant benefits when taking a job that might pay less than previous work or end up only being temporary. Under the new law, workers will be able to essentially put benefits on hold when they take temporary work, instead of seeing their benefits recalculated each time.<ref name=labour/>\n\n===Pension reform===\nAs President, Hollande pursued reform to the pension system in France. The process proved to be very contentious, with members of Parliament, Labor Unions, and general public all opposed. Mass protests and demonstrations occurred throughout Paris. Despite the opposition, the French Parliament did pass a reform in December 2013 aimed at plugging a pension deficit expected to reach 20.7 billion euros ($28.4 billion) by 2020 if nothing were to be done. Rather than raising the mandatory retirement age, as many economists had advised, Hollande pursued increases in contributions, leaving the retirement age untouched. The reform had a rough ride in parliament, being rejected twice by the Senate, where Hollande's Socialist Party has a slim majority, before it won sufficient backing in a final vote before the lower house of parliament. French private sector workers will see the size and duration of their pension contributions increase only modestly under the reform while their retirement benefits are largely untouched.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20393182/french-parliament-approves-pension-reform/ |title=French parliament approves pension reform |agency=Reuters |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104203944/http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/20393182/french-parliament-approves-pension-reform/ |archivedate=4 January 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{see also|List of presidential trips made by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande}}\n[[File:Francois Hollande Bastille Day 2013 Paris t101747.jpg|thumb|Hollande reviewing troops during the 2013 [[Bastille Day military parade]]]]\nAs President, Hollande promised an early withdrawal of French combat troops present in Afghanistan in 2012.<ref name=guardianAC1/><ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|last=Fouquet |first=Helene |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-26/sarkozy-rival-hollande-may-seek-bank-split-in-election-platform.html |title=Socialist Hollande Pledges Tax Breaks End, Eased Pension Measure |publisher=Bloomberg |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> He also pledged to conclude a new contract of [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German partnership]], advocating the adoption of a [[European Directive|Directive]] on the protection of public services.

Epstein is currently the [[Laurence A. Tisch]] Professor of Law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at [[New York University]], the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], and the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law emeritus and a senior lecturer at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nEpstein's writings have extensively influenced American legal thought. In 2000, a study published in ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by ''[[Legal Affairs]]'' as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times.  A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only [[Cass Sunstein]] and [[Erwin Chemerinsky]]. He has been a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1985.  \n\nIn early 2020, Epstein attacked estimates of millions of US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic. Arguing that the term pandemic is not one to be used lightly, he made the contrarian prediction there would ultimately be 5,000 US deaths [corrected from an initial 500].<ref name=\":0\">https://www.hoover.org/research/coronavirus-isnt-pandemic</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-contrarian-coronavirus-theory-that-informed-the-trump-administration|title=The Contrarian Coronavirus Theory That Informed the Trump Administration|last=Chotiner|first=Isaac|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>.

Epstein was born on April 17, 1943, in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. His grandparents were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who immigrated to the United States from [[Russia]] and [[Austria]] in the early 20th century.  Epstein's father, Bernard Epstein (1908{{ndash}}1978), was a [[radiologist]], and his mother, Catherine Epstein (''n\u00e9e'' Reiser; 1908{{ndash}}2004), managed his father's medical office.<ref>Frey (2009).</ref>  He has two sisters.

He had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a traditional single [[Major (academic)|major]], and obtained special permission from the university to pursue a self-selected program of study across the three areas of [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], and [[mathematics]].  He graduated with a [[B.A.]] ''[[Latin honors#North America|summa cum laude]]'' in 1964. Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a [[Kellett Fellowship]], an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either [[Cambridge University]] or [[Oxford University]]. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, where he was a member of [[Oriel College]] and earned a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] B.A. in [[jurisprudence]] in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the [[Yale Law School]], graduating with an [[LL.B.]] ''cum laude'' in 1968.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC). He taught at USC for four years before moving to the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1972.  Epstein taught at Chicago for 38 years, eventually holding the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law.  Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of [[New York University]] as its inaugural [[Laurence A. Tisch]] Professor of Law.  He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis.  In 2013, New York University's [[New York University School of Law|School of Law]] established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.<ref>{{cite web | author=<!-- Staff author, no by-line --> | title =Classical Liberal Institute launched at conference on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac | url = http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/fannie-freddie-conference-cli | publisher = NYU School of Law | date = 20 September 2013 | access-date = 12 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], a prominent American public policy think tank located at [[Stanford University]].\n\nEpstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards.  In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the [[University of Chicago Medical School]], and in 1985 was inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/epstein Richard A.

In ''Takings'', Epstein argued that the \"[[takings clause]]\" of the [[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]{{mdash}}which reads, \"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\", and is traditionally viewed as a limit on the governmental power of [[eminent domain]]{{mdash}}gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights,{{sfnp|Ely|2006|p=421}} and so requires the government to be regarded the same as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \"takings clause\" after its publication. In 1991, during [[Clarence Thomas]]' [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings]], Senator [[Joe Biden]], \"in a dramatic movement,\" held the book up and \"repeatedly interrogated\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis.{{sfnp|Ely|2006|p=421}} The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property.<ref name=\"uchicago\">[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/epsteintakings.html News release]</ref> The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights<ref name=\"reason\">{{cite news  | title = Takings Exception  | author = Steve Chapman  | publisher = Reason  | date = April 1995  | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29662.html  | accessdate = 2008-10-26 }}</ref> and has been cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] four times, including the 1992 case ''[[Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council]]''.<ref name=\"uchicago\"/>\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book ''Simple Rules for a Complex World'' (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on [[Gary Becker]], he argues that the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and other [[anti-discrimination]] legislation would be better if they were repealed. Consistent with the principles of [[classical liberalism]], he believes that the federal regulation on [[same-sex marriage]], the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], should be repealed,<ref>{{cite magazine  | title = Judicial Offensive Against Defense Of Marriage Act  | author =Richard A.

That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.\n\nHe has criticized the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Hard Questions On Same-Sex Marriage | author =Richard A.

Epstein is currently the [[Laurence A. Tisch]] Professor of Law and director of the Classical Liberal Institute at [[New York University]], the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], and the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law emeritus and a senior lecturer at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nEpstein's writings have extensively influenced American legal thought. In 2000, a study published in ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' identified Epstein as the 12th-most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. In 2008, he was chosen in a poll taken by ''[[Legal Affairs]]'' as one of the most influential legal thinkers of modern times.  A study of legal publications between 2009 and 2013 found Epstein to be the 3rd-most frequently cited American legal scholar during that period, behind only [[Cass Sunstein]] and [[Erwin Chemerinsky]]. He has been a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since 1985.  \n\nIn early 2020, Epstein attacked estimates of millions of US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic. Arguing that the term pandemic is not one to be used lightly, he made the contrarian prediction there would ultimately be 5,000 US deaths [corrected from an initial 500].<ref name=\":0\">https://www.hoover.org/research/coronavirus-isnt-pandemic</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-contrarian-coronavirus-theory-that-informed-the-trump-administration|title=The Contrarian Coronavirus Theory That Informed the Trump Administration|last=Chotiner|first=Isaac|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>.

He attended elementary school at P.S.{{nbsp}}161, a school that is now one of the [[Success Academy Charter Schools]].<ref name=\"edpod\">{{cite podcast |url=http://www.hoover.org/research/libertarian-education-libertarian |title=The Education of a Libertarian |website=The Libertarian Podcast |publisher=Hoover Institution |host=Troy Senik; Richard Epstein |date=29 July 2015 |time= |access-date=6 September 2015 }}</ref>  Epstein and his family lived in Brooklyn until 1954, when his father began working at the [[Long Island Jewish Medical Center]] and their family moved to [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck, Long Island]].<ref name=\"edpod\" />\n\nEpstein attended [[Columbia University]] as an undergraduate student in the early 1960s.  He had wide-ranging academic interests and did not wish to select a traditional single [[Major (academic)|major]], and obtained special permission from the university to pursue a self-selected program of study across the three areas of [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], and [[mathematics]].  He graduated with a [[B.A.]] ''[[Latin honors#North America|summa cum laude]]'' in 1964. Epstein's undergraduate performance earned him a [[Kellett Fellowship]], an award at Columbia that pays for two of each year's top graduates to spend two years in England studying at either [[Cambridge University]] or [[Oxford University]]. Epstein chose to attend Oxford, where he was a member of [[Oriel College]] and earned a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] B.A. in [[jurisprudence]] in 1966. He then returned to the United States to attend the [[Yale Law School]], graduating with an [[LL.B.]] ''cum laude'' in 1968.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Epstein was hired as an assistant professor of law at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC). He taught at USC for four years before moving to the [[University of Chicago Law School]] in 1972.  Epstein taught at Chicago for 38 years, eventually holding the title of James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Law.  Epstein formally retired from Chicago in 2010, but quickly came out of retirement to join the faculty of [[New York University]] as its inaugural [[Laurence A. Tisch]] Professor of Law.  He remains a professor emeritus and senior lecturer at Chicago, teaching courses there on an occasional basis.  In 2013, New York University's [[New York University School of Law|School of Law]] established a new academic research center, the Classical Liberal Institute, and named Epstein as its inaugural director.<ref>{{cite web | author=<!-- Staff author, no by-line --> | title =Classical Liberal Institute launched at conference on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac | url = http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/fannie-freddie-conference-cli | publisher = NYU School of Law | date = 20 September 2013 | access-date = 12 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSince 2001, Epstein has served as the Peter and Kirsten Bedford Senior Fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], a prominent American public policy think tank located at [[Stanford University]].\n\nEpstein has served in many academic and public organizations and has received a number of awards.  In 1983, Epstein was made a senior fellow at the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the [[University of Chicago Medical School]], and in 1985 was inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/epstein Richard A. Epstein], ''University of Chicago''.</ref>  He was editor of the ''[[Journal of Legal Studies]]'' from 1981 to 1991, and was editor of the ''[[Journal of Law and Economics]]'' from 1991 to 2001.

In ''Takings'', Epstein argued that the \"[[takings clause]]\" of the [[Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]{{mdash}}which reads, \"...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation\", and is traditionally viewed as a limit on the governmental power of [[eminent domain]]{{mdash}}gives constitutional protection to citizens' economic rights,{{sfnp|Ely|2006|p=421}} and so requires the government to be regarded the same as any other private entity in a property dispute. The argument was controversial and sparked a great deal of debate on the interpretation of the \"takings clause\" after its publication. In 1991, during [[Clarence Thomas]]' [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearings]], Senator [[Joe Biden]], \"in a dramatic movement,\" held the book up and \"repeatedly interrogated\" Thomas regarding his position on the book's thesis.{{sfnp|Ely|2006|p=421}} The book served as a focal point in the argument about the government's ability to control private property.<ref name=\"uchicago\">[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/epsteintakings.html News release]</ref> The book has also influenced how some courts view property rights<ref name=\"reason\">{{cite news  | title = Takings Exception  | author = Steve Chapman  | publisher = Reason  | date = April 1995  | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/29662.html  | accessdate = 2008-10-26 }}</ref> and has been cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] four times, including the 1992 case ''[[Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council]]''.<ref name=\"uchicago\"/>\n\nEpstein is an advocate of minimal legal regulation. In his book ''Simple Rules for a Complex World'' (1995), Epstein consolidated much of his previous work and argues that simple rules work best because complexities create excessive costs. Complexity comes from attempting to do justice in individual cases. Complex rules are justifiable, however, if they can be opted out of. For instance, drawing on [[Gary Becker]], he argues that the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and other [[anti-discrimination]] legislation would be better if they were repealed. Consistent with the principles of [[classical liberalism]], he believes that the federal regulation on [[same-sex marriage]], the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], should be repealed,<ref>{{cite magazine  | title = Judicial Offensive Against Defense Of Marriage Act  | author =Richard A.

That power carries with it a duty to serve all-comers on equal terms, which means that the state should not be able to pick and choose those on whom it bestows its favors. DOMA offends this principle in two ways. First, it excludes polygamous couples from receiving these marital benefits. Second, it excludes gay couples. Both groups contribute to the funds that support these various government programs. Both should share in its benefits.\n\nHe has criticized the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Hard Questions On Same-Sex Marriage | author =Richard A.

Taking a decidedly skeptical approach, Epstein concluded that no new national narrative can be achieved \"unless we engage in what I call American minimalism\u2014a conscious reduction of the issues that we think are truly best handled as a nation and not better address by smaller subnational groups: states, local governments, and, most importantly, all sorts of small private organizations that are free to choose as they please in setting their own membership and mission.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Claybourn |editor-first1=Joshua |editor-link1=Joshua Claybourn |title=Our American Story: The Search for a Shared National Narrative |date=2019 |publisher=Potomac Books |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=978-1640121706 |pages=175\u2013188 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2020, Epstein wrote several essays published by the [[Hoover Institution]] giving a contrarian account of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, suggesting that the public health consensus was an overreaction. <ref>{{cite news  | title = Coronavirus Perspective| author =Richard A.
