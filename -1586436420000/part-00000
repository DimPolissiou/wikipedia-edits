He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.
