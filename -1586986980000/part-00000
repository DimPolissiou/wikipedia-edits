These rivers join at the county's southwest tip.\n\nThe soil covering much of Mason County is very sandy. This was formed during the melting of the [[Wisconsin Glacier]] about 10,000 years ago. Meltwater from the glacier deposited large amounts of sand in a delta region near at the junction of the Sangamon and Illinois Rivers.\n\nThe sandy soil does not hold water well, quickly exposing crops to drought conditions as the [[water table]] drops during periods of low precipitation.

Dewey]] in 1944. The past decade or so has seen Mason turn solidly Republican due to opposition to the Democratic Party\u2019s social liberalism and concern over the lack of employment and other economic opportunities in the \u201c[[Rust Belt]]\u201d \u2013 whose edge Mason County lies on.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

These rivers join at the county's southwest tip.\n\nThe soil covering much of Mason County is very sandy. This was formed during the melting of the [[Wisconsin Glacier]] about 10,000 years ago. Meltwater from the glacier deposited large amounts of sand in a delta region near at the junction of the Sangamon and Illinois Rivers.\n\nThe sandy soil does not hold water well, quickly exposing crops to drought conditions as the [[water table]] drops during periods of low precipitation. However, the soil is very good for growing vegetables that are otherwise not common in Illinois. Modern irrigation has made this a highly productive agricultural area.\n\nA sand wetland on the Illinois River is managed by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as the [[Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Havana, Illinois]]\n|14|32|1.85\n|19|38|1.94\n|30|50|3.02\n|40|63|3.45\n|51|74|4.43\n|60|84|3.81\n|64|88|3.87\n|61|86|3.45\n|52|80|3.21\n|41|68|2.86\n|30|51|3.26\n|19|37|2.63\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0521\n |title       = Monthly Averages for Havana, Illinois\n |accessdate  = 2011-01-27\n |publisher   = The Weather Channel\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20121023161031/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0521\n |archivedate = 2012-10-23\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Havana have ranged from a low of {{convert|14|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|88|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-30|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1999 and a record high of {{convert|106|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1983.

Dewey]] in 1944. The past decade or so has seen Mason turn solidly Republican due to opposition to the Democratic Party\u2019s social liberalism and concern over the lack of employment and other economic opportunities in the \u201c[[Rust Belt]]\u201d \u2013 whose edge Mason County lies on.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The apical complex consists of a set of spirally arranged [[microtubule]]s (the [[conoid (organelle)|conoid]]), a secretory body (the [[rhoptry]]) and one or more [[polar ring]]s. Additional slender electron-dense secretory bodies ([[microneme]]s) surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present. This structure gives the phylum its name. A further group of spherical organelles is distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the [[apical complex]] and are known as the dense granules. These typically have a mean diameter around 0.7 \u03bcm. Secretion of the dense-granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the [[parasitophorous vacuole]] and persists for several minutes.\n\n*[[Flagellum|Flagella]] are found only in the motile gamete.

Typically, a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to [[entosis]]), which divide to produce [[sporozoite]]s that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing [[merozoites]], which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until gamonts are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  Many variations occur on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.\n\nThe apical complex includes [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the polar ring, and among the Conoidasida is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the conoid.<ref name=coccidiaworld>{{cite web |url=http://biology.unm.edu/biology/coccidia/home.html|title=The Coccidia of the World| last = Duszynski| first = Donald W. | first2 = Steve J. |last2=Upton |first3=Lee |last3=Couch| publisher = Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, and Division of Biology, Kansas State University| date = 2004-02-21| format = Online database }}</ref>   Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semirigid pellicle.\n\nThe presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s. Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''[[Colpodella]]'', have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.\n\nAnother similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the [[apicoplast]], surrounded by either three or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis, and it appears to be necessary for survival.  In general, plastids are considered to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from [[red algae]] rather than [[green alga|green]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481\u20131493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

They are often found in the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]s of their hosts, but may invade the other tissues. In the typical gregarine lifecycle, a [[trophozoite]] develops within a host cell into a schizont. This then divides into a number of [[merozoite]]s by [[schizogony]]. The [[merozoite]]s are released by lysing the host cell, which in turn invade other cells. At some point in the apicomplexan lifecycle, [[gametocytes]] are formed. These are released by lysis of the host cells, which group together. Each gametocyte forms multiple [[gamete]]s. The gametes fuse with another to form [[oocyst]]s. The oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host.\n\n===Coccidians===\n[[File:Toxoplasma gondii.jpg|thumb|150px|Dividing ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' (Coccidia) parasites]]\n{{Main|Coccidia}}\nIn general, coccidians are parasites of [[vertebrate]]s. Like gregarines, they are commonly parasites of the [[epithelial]] cells of the gut, but may infect other tissues.\n\nThe coccidian lifecycle involves merogony, gametogony, and sporogony. While similar to that of the gregarines it differs in [[zygote]] formation. Some trophozoites enlarge and become [[macrogamete]], whereas others divide repeatedly to form [[microgamete]]s (anisogamy). The microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it. The fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote that in its turn forms an oocyst that is normally released from the body. Syzygy, when it occurs, involves markedly anisogamous gametes. The lifecycle is typically haploid, with the only diploid stage occurring in the zygote, which is normally short-lived.\n\nThe main difference between the coccidians and the gregarines is in the gamonts. In the coccidia, these are small, intracellular, and without [[epimerite]]s or [[mucron]]s. In the gregarines, these are large, extracellular, and possess epimerites or mucrons. A second difference between the coccidia and the gregarines also lies in the gamonts. In the coccidians, a single gamont becomes a macrogametocyte, whereas in the gregarines, the gamonts give rise to multiple gametocytes.\n\n===Haemosporidia===\n[[File:Immature and mature trophozoites of the Plasmodium vivax parasite PHIL 2720 lores.jpg|thumb|150px|upright=1.3|Trophozoites of the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' (Haemosporidia) parasite among human red blood cells]]\n{{Main|Haemosporida}}\nThe Haemosporidia have more complex lifecycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host. The trophozoite parasitises [[erythrocyte]]s or other tissues in the vertebrate host. Microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood. The gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal. The microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes. The fertilized macrogamete now becomes an [[ookinete]], which penetrates the body of the vector. The ookinete then transforms into an oocyst and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis (haplontic lifecycle) to give rise to the [[sporozoite]]s. The sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again.\n\n==Ecology and distribution==\n[[File:Parasite140105-fig3 Toxoplasmosis in a bar-shouldered dove - TEM of 2 tachyzoites.tif|thumb|Two tachyzoites of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', transmission electron microscopy]]\nMany of the apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of human and domestic animals. In contrast to [[bacteria]]l pathogens, these apicomplexan parasites are [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and share many metabolic pathways with their animal hosts. This makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult \u2013 a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host. At present, no effective [[vaccine]]s are available for most diseases caused by these parasites. Biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult, if not impossible, to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms. In recent years, several of the apicomplexan species have been selected for [[genome sequencing]]. The availability of genome sequences provides a new opportunity for scientists to learn more about the [[evolution]] and biochemical capacity of these parasites.

The apical complex consists of a set of spirally arranged [[microtubule]]s (the [[conoid (organelle)|conoid]]), a secretory body (the [[rhoptry]]) and one or more [[polar ring]]s. Additional slender electron-dense secretory bodies ([[microneme]]s) surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present. This structure gives the phylum its name. A further group of spherical organelles is distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the [[apical complex]] and are known as the dense granules. These typically have a mean diameter around 0.7 \u03bcm. Secretion of the dense-granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the [[parasitophorous vacuole]] and persists for several minutes.\n\n*[[Flagellum|Flagella]] are found only in the motile gamete. These are posteriorly directed and vary in number (usually one to three).\n*[[Basal body|Basal bodies]] are present.

Typically, a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to [[entosis]]), which divide to produce [[sporozoite]]s that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing [[merozoites]], which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until gamonts are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  Many variations occur on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.\n\nThe apical complex includes [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the polar ring, and among the Conoidasida is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the conoid.<ref name=coccidiaworld>{{cite web |url=http://biology.unm.edu/biology/coccidia/home.html|title=The Coccidia of the World| last = Duszynski| first = Donald W. | first2 = Steve J. |last2=Upton |first3=Lee |last3=Couch| publisher = Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, and Division of Biology, Kansas State University| date = 2004-02-21| format = Online database }}</ref>   Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semirigid pellicle.\n\nThe presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s.

Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis, and it appears to be necessary for survival.

They are often found in the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]s of their hosts, but may invade the other tissues. In the typical gregarine lifecycle, a [[trophozoite]] develops within a host cell into a schizont. This then divides into a number of [[merozoite]]s by [[schizogony]]. The [[merozoite]]s are released by lysing the host cell, which in turn invade other cells. At some point in the apicomplexan lifecycle, [[gametocytes]] are formed. These are released by lysis of the host cells, which group together. Each gametocyte forms multiple [[gamete]]s. The gametes fuse with another to form [[oocyst]]s. The oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host.\n\n===Coccidians===\n[[File:Toxoplasma gondii.jpg|thumb|150px|Dividing ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' (Coccidia) parasites]]\n{{Main|Coccidia}}\nIn general, coccidians are parasites of [[vertebrate]]s. Like gregarines, they are commonly parasites of the [[epithelial]] cells of the gut, but may infect other tissues.\n\nThe coccidian lifecycle involves merogony, gametogony, and sporogony. While similar to that of the gregarines it differs in [[zygote]] formation. Some trophozoites enlarge and become [[macrogamete]], whereas others divide repeatedly to form [[microgamete]]s (anisogamy). The microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it. The fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote that in its turn forms an oocyst that is normally released from the body. Syzygy, when it occurs, involves markedly anisogamous gametes. The lifecycle is typically haploid, with the only diploid stage occurring in the zygote, which is normally short-lived.\n\nThe main difference between the coccidians and the gregarines is in the gamonts. In the coccidia, these are small, intracellular, and without [[epimerite]]s or [[mucron]]s. In the gregarines, these are large, extracellular, and possess epimerites or mucrons. A second difference between the coccidia and the gregarines also lies in the gamonts. In the coccidians, a single gamont becomes a macrogametocyte, whereas in the gregarines, the gamonts give rise to multiple gametocytes.\n\n===Haemosporidia===\n[[File:Immature and mature trophozoites of the Plasmodium vivax parasite PHIL 2720 lores.jpg|thumb|150px|upright=1.3|Trophozoites of the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' (Haemosporidia) parasite among human red blood cells]]\n{{Main|Haemosporida}}\nThe Haemosporidia have more complex lifecycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host. The trophozoite parasitises [[erythrocyte]]s or other tissues in the vertebrate host. Microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood. The gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal. The microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes. The fertilized macrogamete now becomes an [[ookinete]], which penetrates the body of the vector. The ookinete then transforms into an oocyst and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis (haplontic lifecycle) to give rise to the [[sporozoite]]s. The sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again.\n\n==Ecology and distribution==\n[[File:Parasite140105-fig3 Toxoplasmosis in a bar-shouldered dove - TEM of 2 tachyzoites.tif|thumb|Two tachyzoites of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', transmission electron microscopy]]\nMany of the apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of human and domestic animals. In contrast to [[bacteria]]l pathogens, these apicomplexan parasites are [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and share many metabolic pathways with their animal hosts. This makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult \u2013 a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host. At present, no effective [[vaccine]]s are available for most diseases caused by these parasites. Biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult, if not impossible, to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms.

During 1826\u20131850, 41 species and six genera of Apicomplexa were named.
