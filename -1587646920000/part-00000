PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]] at [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba district]] was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million [[drachmas]] and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of [[NRDC-GR|III Army Corps]] officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.\n\nThere were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]]. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium's construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1&nbsp;million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the \"Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium\" in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.\n\nThe inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against [[AEK FC]] (PAOK prevailed 1\u20130 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]'s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion. As for the ball for the first kick-off, it fell at 17:30 off an airplane of Sedes Military Air Base.

PAOK had to relocate and a 7.5 acres area, owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]] at [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba district]] was chosen as the adequate location. The purchase cost was set at 1.5 million [[drachmas]] and was paid by PAOK administration in 20 six-month instalments of 75,000 drachmas each. On 7 February 1958, a committee of [[NRDC-GR|III Army Corps]] officers delivered the land to PAOK representatives.\n\nThere were still barracks on the premises, housing victims of the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[1953 Ionian earthquake]]. Relocating all these people cost the club 70,000 drachmas. The total cost of the stadium's construction amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1.1&nbsp;million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention. In spring of 1958 construction work started, based on the plans of architect Minas Trempelas and civil engineer Antonis Triglianos. In an attempt to collect the necessary funds, the club issued the \"Lottery for the construction of PAOK New Stadium\" in April 1958 at a cost of 20 drachmas each. Since 1956, the administration was withholding 15% of the gate income in order to fund the construction of the new stadium. Many PAOK fans, apart from money, also contributed to construction by volunteering to work as builders. The construction of the stadium was completed at a record time of one year.\n\nThe inauguration event was scheduled for Sunday 6 September 1959 with a friendly encounter against [[AEK FC]] (PAOK prevailed 1\u20130 with a goal by Kostas Kiourtzis). Prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]'s attendance was cancelled at the last minute. However, several ministers of his government were there for the occasion.

As a result of this outdoor work, Sangret developed a lithe, muscular physique.<ref name=\"Tragic End of Joan the Wigwam Girl\">{{cite news|title=Tragic End of Joan the Wigwam Girl |date=16 May 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19430516&id=s0VQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9Q0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6558,5763706&hl=en |accessdate=4 February 2019|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 17, Sangret received the first of many diagnoses that he had contracted a [[venereal disease]]. On this first occasion, upon medical advice, he had unsuccessfully attempted to cure himself using a [[potassium permanganate]] solution, before admitting himself to a Battleford hospital to undergo extensive treatment for a [[urinary retention|bladder obstruction]].{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=129\u2013130}} This would prove to be the first of at least six occasions in which Sangret would receive treatment for a contracted venereal disease, attesting to his sexual [[promiscuity]], although the remaining five instances would occur between 1938 and 1942.{{refn|group=n|In the autumn of 1942, Sangret submitted a blood sample to determine whether he was cured of [[syphilis]]. The results of this [[Wassermann test]] concluded he was free from the disease{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=130}}}}\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Sangret accrued an extensive criminal record, which included six months served in [[gaol]] for a violent assault committed in 1932, a three-month sentence served in 1938 for threatening to shoot a woman, and numerous convictions for both [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and theft.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=131}} He was regularly unemployed, and enlisted to serve in the [[Battleford Light Infantry]] in 1935. This [[militia]] regiment trained for just two weeks each year, and Sangret served with this regiment until 1939.\n\n===Wolfe===\nJoan Pearl Wolfe was born in [[Tonbridge, Kent]], on 11 March 1923, the oldest of three children born to Edith and Charles Wolfe.\nThroughout her childhood, Wolfe lived modestly with her parents in a strict [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] household in this market town. In 1928, she and her family moved from Tonbridge to [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]]. While the family resided in Tunbridge Wells, Joan attended a [[convent school]] in nearby [[Rotherfield#Mark Cross|Mark Cross]], with her tuition fees reportedly paid by a wealthy aunt.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=51\u201352}} She attended this convent school until age 16, becoming fluent in the [[French language]], and although outwardly [[pious]] and known to regularly wear a conspicuous [[crucifix]] about her neck, she apparently lacked any serious religious commitment.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=53\u201357}}\n\nWolfe's father, Charles, was known locally as an [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] figure, who suffered from [[insomnia]] and was prone to sudden public outbursts of paranoia and hostility; he committed suicide in 1930 by gassing himself while Joan attended the Mark Cross convent school. Following her husband's suicide, Wolfe's mother subsequently remarried, and later bore a fourth child.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=50}}\n\nWith her mother's approval, Wolfe became [[engagement|engaged]] to an affluent young man from Tunbridge Wells shortly before her 16th birthday in 1939. Reportedly, Joan's fianc\u00e9 lavished his attention and affections on her,{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=52}} although later the same year, while still engaged, Wolfe first ran away from home.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=52}} On this first occasion, her mother reported her daughter missing to police, and Joan was discovered approximately one month later in the town of [[Aldershot]]. She was driven back to Tunbridge Wells by her fianc\u00e9's mother, although shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Wolfe chose to call off her engagement and instead travel to [[London]] to train as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=53}}\n\nAfter one month, Wolfe left this employment, but did not inform her mother of this fact. It is at this stage in her life in which Wolfe's behaviour is believed to have become increasingly irresponsible and promiscuous, and she is known to have subsequently engaged in casual affairs with several soldiers between 1940 and 1942, most of whom served with the [[Canadian Army]]. Wolfe's behaviour from 1940 onward attests to her being gullible, extremely [[naivety|na\u00efve]], prone to flights of fancy, yet apparently yearning for stability. Her na\u00efvety may have been compounded by her heavily [[chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] convent upbringing. These facts are evidenced not only in her behaviour, but in the content of the numerous letters she is known to have written to her final lover, who would ultimately prove to be her murderer. Moreover, until her death, she neither drank, smoked<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\">{{cite news|title=The War's Best True Detective Story |date=13 June 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19430613&id=yCBPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cE0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5835,5971574&hl=en |accessdate=3 February 2019|publisher=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref> or used any profane language in her vocabulary.<ref name=\"Hooked Knife Led to Killer\">{{cite news|title=Hooked Knife Led to Killer |date=28 August 1982 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19820828&id=cb4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8O4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2288,3764499&hl=en |accessdate=3 February 2019|publisher=The Ottawa Citizen}}</ref>\n\nAlthough little beyond subsequent trial testimony is known of Wolfe's relationship with her mother, the evidence which exists attests to Edith Watts being a simple, caring woman, gradually driven to despair by her eldest daughter's increasingly unpredictable and irresponsible behaviour; however, Wolfe herself may have found her mother's attitude somewhat overbearing.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=80}} Nonetheless, via letter and in person, Edith is known to have repeatedly implored her daughter to return to or remain at home, and to revert to a stable, respectable lifestyle. In addition, contrary to Wolfe's claims that those in positions of authority had seldom made any serious efforts to help her, the police\u2014occasionally at Edith's urging\u2014did intervene on several occasions out of concern for her welfare, and she was repeatedly offered various forms of assistance, but would inevitably revert to her somewhat nomadic lifestyle.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=79\u201381}}\n\nDespite her wayward lifestyle, Joan did remain sporadic written correspondence with her mother between 1940 and 1942, and she is known to have infrequently returned home to Tunbridge Wells for brief periods\u2014twice in the company of Canadian soldiers she was dating\u2014to visit her family,{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=61\u201363}} before opting to return to [[Godalming]] or [[Guildford]]. She is known to have held several menial forms of employment from 1940 onward; alternately residing in cheap lodgings or sleeping rough. Wolfe is also known to have formed a close friendship with an elderly lady named Kate Hayter in the village of [[Thursley]] while she lived and worked in Godalming. According to Wolfe, Hayter allowed her sleep at her [[bungalow]], and to both wash and change her clothes, when she was unemployed.<ref name=\"Guildford' p. 111\">''Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths in Guildford'' p. 111</ref>\n\nOn each occasion Edith wrote to or spoke with her daughter, she would argue with Joan as to her irresponsible and promiscuous lifestyle. By 1942, the relationship between mother and daughter had deteriorated and, in May, Edith wrote a final letter to her daughter, informing her she was \"finished with you. I have been more than fair to you; forgiven you for things no other mother would have done ... You said something about repaying me for all I have done for you ... Joan, I shall be paid in full the day you come and truthfully say, 'Mum, I'm going to be a good girl'. Joan, that will be the happiest day of my life.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=55}}\n\n==War years==\nOn 19 June 1940, nine months after Canada had proclaimed her intention to join the war effort, Sangret chose to enlist as a full-time soldier in the [[The Royal Regina Rifles|Regina Rifle Regiment]]. Shortly thereafter, his regiment was transferred to [[CFAD Dundurn|Dundurn Camp]]. His career as a soldier is marred with several blemishes, and he was repeatedly punished for both minor and major infractions of military discipline, including several instances in which he was reported [[absent without leave]] (although no record exists of Sangret ever being returned to barracks against his will.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=128}}) Throughout his military service, he never advanced beyond the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/records/2292043/private-august-sangret-canadian-army-royal-canadian-infantry-corps/|title=Record Details for August Sangret|date=1 January 2013|via=forces-war-records.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nSangret's regiment was deployed to Britain on 24 March 1942. He was initially stationed in [[Fleet, Hampshire]], before being posted to Aldershot and, on 13 July, to Jasper Camp.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tweedsmuirmilitarycamp.co.uk/r%26e.html |title=Tweedsmuir Military Camp.co.uk |access-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060611/http://www.tweedsmuirmilitarycamp.co.uk/r%26e.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This final posting was in the market town of Godalming, and Sangret became one of an estimated 100,000 soldiers stationed in the vicinity of [[Witley]] and Thursley in 1942.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=145}} At Jasper Camp, Sangret enrolled in a newly formed 12-week educational course for soldiers lacking in elementary education. While stationed in Godalming, Sangret became acquainted with Joan Pearl Wolfe.<ref name=\"Murder on Hankley Common\"/>\n\nThe same year Sangret's regiment was posted to Britain, Joan Wolfe became engaged to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier named Francis Hearn, who returned to Canada on 15 July, having previously promised to marry her (which he had likely known was improbable due to his imminent posting to Canada). Wolfe is known to have thereafter worn a ring given to her by Hearn, and to have occasionally referred to herself as his wife. On one occasion, she is known to have falsely informed a female acquaintance she and Hearn had married in London, and that she and he were both \"heartbroken\" at his being posted back to Canada.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=56}}\n\n===Acquaintance and courtship===\nOn 17 July 1942, the day after Hearn left for Canada, Joan Wolfe and August Sangret met for the first time in a [[public house|pub]] in Godalming. According to Sangret, he had first noted Wolfe when she walked toward a bar and ordered a lemonade, to which he had asked her when she subsequently sat near him whether she was able to purchase \"anything stronger\", and Wolfe\u2014whom he described as being \"rather scruffy\" and downcast in spirit\u2014had simply replied that she \"didn't drink anything stronger\".{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=62}} He and Wolfe had then begun to talk, and later walked through a local park, before engaging in [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] in a field close to the [[River Wey]]. The two then parted company, having arranged to meet again. As would often subsequently occur, Wolfe did not keep her next date, but Sangret and a fellow soldier named Hartnell did by chance encounter her outside a Godalming [[fish and chip shop]] on 21 July. Wolfe had apparently agreed to date Hartnell on this evening, but became notably upset when Hartnell suggested tossing a coin to determine whether he or Sangret should \"have her\" that evening.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=64}} In response, Hartnell simply left Wolfe and Sangret, and the pair were briefly detained by police, before being released. Sangret took Wolfe to the undergrowth close to [[Witley Camp]] that evening, and on this date, upon being informed by Wolfe she had \"nowhere to stay\", constructed the first [[wigwam]] for he and Wolfe to meet. Sangret described this first temporary shelter as being \"a little shack with limbs and stuff.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=64}} He spent the night with Wolfe in this device, returning to barracks at 6 a.m., having given Joan his photograph, address, and arranging to meet her in Godalming that evening. He later furnished this spartan pine structure with army blankets.<ref name=\"Guildford' p. 111\"/>\n\nSangret and Wolfe subsequently met on a regular\u2014yet unreliable\u2014basis in which he would meet her at approximately 7 p.m., then return to barracks to answer the 10 p.m. [[wikt:roll call|roll call]], before returning to the wigwam (which he referred to as \"the shack\") to spend the night with her. Early in their courtship, this first wigwam he had constructed was discovered, and Wolfe evicted from the structure; in response, Sangret constructed a second, larger device for he and Wolfe to meet in his off-duty hours, again constructed using the traditional skills of his Cree ancestors he had honed in his youth, and again located close to his base on [[Hankley Common]] (then an army training ground regularly used for military exercises). Each structure was devised from long poles, saplings and branches covered by sheets of [[birch bark]] and [[bracken]]. The tools used for constructing these shelters included a small, crooked knife that is unique to the Cree.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=112}}\n\nOn 23 July, Wolfe was admitted to hospital, having fainted in a Guildford street. She informed Sangret of this fact in a letter, imploring him to visit her (Sangret did attempt to visit on this date, but missed official visiting hours and was thus refused entry). Three days later, she wrote a second letter to Sangret,<ref>{{cite news|title=Killed Girl to Escape Marriage, NCO Alleges |date=25 January 1943 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/212232355 |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=The Evening Advocate}}</ref> reading in part:\n\n{{cquote|My Dear August,\nWell, I hope you are well, as I have not seen or heard from you. It is so very lonely here without anyone to speak to, and there is so much I want to tell you. They are going to try and get me somewhere to stay in Godalming, or if this is not possible, in Guildford. Just one week has passed since I have known you, dear. It seems such a long time. I hope you will try and come and see me [in hospital], as I want to tell you when I can come out because someone will have to meet me, and you are all I have in the world. Of course if you don't want to come I shall understand, August, but I am sure I shall never understand men. I do not know enough about them, but I can live and learn. Anyway, I am pretty sure we are going to have a tiny wee one, maybe that is why you do not want to come and see me because you think that? I hope not anyway, but dear, I would not blame you one little bit, if you did not want to marry me because I really am too young, and too old-fashioned to be married. I regret what we did now it is too late, for I still say it is wicked. I guess you think I am silly, and I suppose I am, but remember I was brought up in a strict Catholic school. We were taught to have a baby before you were married was a sin. I do not know anything about babies. Well, I suppose I shall have to close this letter now, so au revoir (daddy). God bless you always dear. Joan.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=66}} }}\n\n(Although [[pathology|pathologists]] who later examined Wolfe's body were unable to determine whether she had been pregnant at the time of her death, had she been so at the time she wrote this letter on 26 July, Sangret\u2014having known Wolfe for just nine days\u2014could not have fathered the child. If Wolfe was indeed pregnant, the father of the child would likely have been Francis Hearn.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=172}})\n\n[[File:Hankley Common - geograph.org.uk - 1250043.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Hankley Common]]. Joan Wolfe lived in two separate wigwams constructed by August Sangret on this [[Common land|common]] between July and August 1942]]\nWhen Wolfe was released from hospital on 28 July, the couple continued to spend a great deal of time together within the wigwam he had constructed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Death Sentence in ''Wigwam\" Case |date=4 March 1943 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11335115 |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=The Argus}}</ref> On 31 July, she briefly obtained employment in a factory constructing [[Barrage balloon#Second World War|barrage balloons]], earning [[\u00a3]]2 10[[shilling|s]] per week, but lost this job as a result of poor timekeeping just three days later; she then informed Sangret of her desire to return to her mother's home, but was unwilling to do so until she had received written permission from her mother. When she received no reply from her mother, Wolfe briefly drifted to London in search of work, but returned to the wigwam after approximately three days. Shortly thereafter, the couple were discovered by a soldier attached to the military police named Donald Brett. Brett instructed Sangret to dismantle the wigwam, and Wolfe\u2014residing on army territory\u2014to move away from the area. Sangret did deconstruct this first wigwam, and almost immediately constructed a second device just 800 [[yard]]s from where he had built the first. This second device was constructed by Sangret in mid- to late-August, using birch saplings and tied with parcel string he had stolen from barracks, although he later claimed he and Wolfe had lived in this second wigwam for just two nights, before the pair had scoured the village of Witley on 23 August, in an unsuccessful search for lodgings.<ref name=\"Century Murder' p. 482\">''World Encyclopedia of 20th Century Murder'' p. 482</ref>\n\nThat same evening the pair had searched for lodgings, Sangret was detained by the [[Military Police#United Kingdom|military police]], and Wolfe escorted by the [[Surrey Police]] to a Guildford hospital (where she would remain until 1 September) in order that she would be in a safe and secure environment. At 11 a.m. the following morning, Sangret was arrested by the military police upon the charge of illegally keeping a girl within the camp precincts.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=69}} The pair were allowed to talk with one-another via telephone, and Joan emphasised to a civilian policeman present that the pair intended to wed. Sangret himself is known to have visited his commanding officer on 24 August, seeking official permission to marry Joan, although he was informed he would need both her mother's approval due to her technical status as a minor, and official permission from the Canadian government.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=71}} (Sangret was provided with a formal marriage application form, but never sought assistance from his colleagues in completing and returning this document.)\n\nOn one occasion in which Sangret visited Wolfe at the Guidford hospital prior to her absconding on 1 September, he was informed by Wolfe herself that doctors who had examined her were \"uncertain\" whether she was pregnant.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=149}}\n\n==September 1942==\nOn 1 September, Wolfe obtained a one-day pass to leave Guildford hospital, informing the matron of her intentions to visit the cinema and shop for new clothes. She never returned to the hospital; instead returning to Sangret, before spending the night sleeping alone in the waiting rooms at [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford railway station]].\n\nWolfe subsequently moved into an abandoned [[cricket pavilion]] in Thursley on or about 3 September,<ref name=\"Hooked Knife Led to Killer\"/> with Sangret providing her with an army-issue blanket and water-bottle stolen from his barracks on this date. In this pavilion, Wolfe would spend extended periods of time, often composing romantic poetry and letters (several of which were smattered with religious overtones), and making childlike drawings of the home into which she evidently envisioned herself and Sangret moving following their marriage. One of these drawings was made on the wall of the cricket pavilion, beneath which an inscription read: 'J. Wolfe now Mrs. Sangret. England. September 9, 1942'.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=60}}\n\nThroughout the two weeks in which Joan Wolfe resided within the abandoned cricket pavilion, Sangret visited her with increasing frequency; often when he should have been at base. He regularly brought food for he and Joan to eat together as they discussed their future plans, including the marriage Wolfe evidently yearned for.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=68}} When they could not meet, Wolfe would send letters to Sangret that would be read to him by a Sergeant Charles Hicks, who would then compose Sangret's replies. The tone and style of Wolfe's letters to Sangret is typically na\u00efve, yet optimistic, and is reminiscent of the letter she had composed on 26 July, with repeated references to her time spent in his company, her hopes for marriage, her general loneliness (which Wolfe is known to have referred to as her \"[[penance]]\"<ref name=\"Tragic End of Joan the Wigwam Girl\"/>), and her desire to be in his company. On at least one occasion, however, Wolfe does hark toward her frustration at Sangret's apparently repeated accusations of [[infidelity]], to which she wrote: \"You know I am in a safe place now anyway, and you will not be able to accuse me of going out with other soldiers. I have never done it since I have known you anyway, but you are so damned jealous you think it; but still we will forget all that now and look forward to the future, when we are married.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=71}}\n\nAs had been the case in July, Wolfe did obtain employment on more than one occasion in the final weeks of her life, but would invariably be fired after a matter of days or weeks due to her unreliability as an employee. To earn money on the numerous occasions she was unemployed, Wolfe\u2014occasionally accompanied by Sangret\u2014would gather blackberries on Hankley Common, which Sangret would sell to his army colleagues for up to 7 [[shilling]]s. Evidently, Wolfe spent some of this money on knitting provisions, as she is known to have knitted several baby clothes in the final weeks of her life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Murder on the Home Front: A True Story of Morgues, Murderers, and Mysteries'' ch. 11</ref>\n\nOn two successive days in the week before her murder, Wolfe was seen by a local resident named William Featherby picking blackberries on the edge of the [[common land|common]], and cooking vegetables over an open fire. On the second of these two occasions, Sangret had been inside the pavilion. The last known individual to see Joan Wolfe alive was a woman named Alice Curtis, who observed Wolfe, in the company of a \"dark-complexioned\" soldier with black hair, walking towards the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Brook, Surrey|Brook]] on Sunday, 13 September.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=82}}\n\n===Disappearance===\nBy 14 September, the relationship between Sangret and Wolfe had lasted 60 days. On this date, Joan Pearl Wolfe disappeared. According to Sangret's subsequent trial testimony, as he returned from the pavilion to barracks that morning, Joan had informed him of her intentions to return to Kate Hayter's Thursley residence. That evening, Sangret and a fellow soldier named Joseph Wells decided to visit a Thursley pub. On two occasions that evening, Sangret is known to have left Wells alone in the pub as he returned to the cricket pavilion. Each time he returned, he explained to Wells he had been searching for Wolfe out of concern for her welfare. On one of these occasions, he did not return for over 30 minutes.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=75}}\n\nIn an apparent effort to construct an [[alibi]], Sangret visited the home of Kate Hayter on 15 September, inquiring whether she had seen Joan, and leaving the pink baby clothes Wolfe had knitted in the weeks prior to her murder in Hayter's possession.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=78}} The same evening, he informed Wells his water-bottle and knife were missing, and that he suspected both items were in Wolfe's possession.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=102}}\n\nSangret is known to have given several conflicting explanations as to Wolfe's whereabouts to his army colleagues in the weeks following her disappearance: to some, he claimed Joan had simply returned home and the \"wedding is off\"; to others, he claimed Joan was in hospital. Furthermore, he is also known to have visited his [[Provost Sergeant]], Harold Wade, on 21 September, ostensibly seeking official assistance in his search for Wolfe. To Wade, Sangret confided he and Joan had \"quarrelled\" after he had informed her of his indifferent attitude to marriage. In response to this explanation, Wade questioned Sangret as to why he should be so concerned as to Joan's whereabouts, given that he evidently had no intentions of marrying her. To this, Sangret had replied: \"If she should be found, and anything has happened to her, I don't want to be mixed up with it.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1928|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nWithin weeks of Wolfe's disappearance, Sangret had begun casually dating local women. As had been the case when he corresponded via letter with Joan Wolfe, he asked his army colleagues to compose his replies due to his illiteracy. One of these colleagues to compose letters for Sangret was a [[sapper]] named Clarence Bear, whom Sangret asked to write a letter to a woman with whom he intended to spend an upcoming period of [[Leave (military)|leave]].{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=84}} When Bear voiced his concerns as to the implications this behaviour may have upon his relationship with Joan Wolfe, Sangret had replied, \"She'll never find out.\"<ref name=\"The Evening Citizen\">{{cite news|title=Indian Soldier is Tried for Death of \"Wigwam Girl\" |date=13 January 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19430111&id=wfwuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AdwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4375,1984591&hl=en |accessdate=2 February 2019|publisher=The Evening Citizen}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nAt 10:20&nbsp;a.m. on 7 October 1942, two [[Royal Marine]]s named William Moore and Geoffrey Cooke, patrolling a section of Hankley Common known as Houndown Wood on a routine military exercise, passed a high mound of earth which had been purposely bulldozed to simulate training upon rough terrain for tank crews. Protruding through the soil of a freshly dug patch of earth on a slope,<ref name=\"Century Murder' p. 482\"/> Moore observed what appeared to be an exposed human arm. Looking closer at the hand of this exposed limb, he further noted that the flesh upon two of the fingers and the thumb had been gnawed away by rats or other vermin, and that a foot also protruded from the earth.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n[[File:Cedric Keith Simpson CBE.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Keith Simpson (professor)|Dr. Keith Simpson]], the pathologist who conducted the autopsy of Joan Wolfe's body]]\nMoore and his colleague did not interfere with the body, but immediately returned to base to report their find to their sergeant. Subsequently, Lieutenant Norman McLeod inspected the site of their discovery, and immediately called the police. The first officers at the scene were Superintendents Richard Webb and Thomas Roberts of Surrey Police; both men deduced the experience of [[Scotland Yard]] was required, and cordoned off the area until the arrival that afternoon of Detective Chief Inspector Edward Greeno and Detective Sergeant Fred Hodge.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1924|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nAt the request of Superintendent Webb, Dr. Eric Gardner, pathologist to the Surrey County Coroner,{{sfn|Quigley|2006|pp=242-243}} and [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] [[Keith Simpson (professor)|Dr. Keith Simpson]] were both summoned to conduct the excavation of the remains.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=15}} Both men arrived at the crime scene the following day.\n\nThe victim was dressed in a green-and-white summer frock with a lace collar and woolen ankle-socks. Her underclothes had not been removed, suggesting that she had not been subjected to a [[sexual assault]] prior to her murder. She was lying face down in a shallow, makeshift grave which had later been disturbed by a passing military vehicle, possibly a [[half-track]], which had loosened the soil and exposed her arm and foot. The left arm was folded beneath the chest, with the exposed right arm notably outstretched, indicating the victim had likely been dragged to the location where she lay.\n\nThe body itself was badly [[decomposition|decomposed]], with the head, chest and abdominal cavity described by Simpson as being a \"seething mass of maggots\", which had eaten much of the soft body tissue, including the head and neck, save for a small section of scalp and hair.<ref>''Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century'' p.243</ref> A headscarf was found knotted around the victim's neck, but the knot itself was extremely slack, instantly enabling both men to dismiss [[strangulation]] as the cause of death; instead, both men strongly speculated the cause of death had been the extensive [[blunt trauma]] to the skull, which had \"all but collapsed\" in the attack. The extent of decomposition indicated that the victim had likely died between five and seven weeks prior to her discovery.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=21}} Furthermore, the murderer had dragged his victim uphill to the location where he had buried her; this conclusion was further supported by the presence of three parallel scrapes upon the skin of the right ankle, which corresponded with tears in the right sock.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|pages=1926|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nThe body was removed and taken to [[Guy's Hospital]], to await a formal [[autopsy]].{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=17}}\n\n===Autopsy===\nOn the evening of 8 October, Dr. Simpson conducted an autopsy upon the victim, ascertaining that the body was that of a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] female, approximately 20 years old and 5 feet, 4 inches in height. Her cropped hair was naturally sandy brown in colour, but had been bleached blonde several weeks before her death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1925|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nHaving carefully reconstructed the skull by wiring together all 38<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 287\">''On Trial for Murder'' p. 287</ref> fragments that could be found, Simpson clearly revealed a large impact site at the rear of the skull measuring five inches in length and one-and-three-quarter inches in breadth, further affirming his earlier conclusions at the crime scene. This injury, coupled with a fracture to the victim's right cheek bone, led Simpson to conclude that the victim had died as a result of a single, heavy blow to back of the head, inflicted while the victim was lying face down. The weapon which had delivered this fatal injury was a pole or bough of wood, and the blow from this weapon had caved in the skull. The commensurate positioning of the fracture to the cheek bone further supported the conclusion the victim had been killed as she lay face down on the ground.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=23}} These injuries would have induced rapid [[unconsciousness]], and death would have resulted within minutes.\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"I thought it had begun in the [[dell (landform)|dell]] where Joan's papers were found, probably with the stabbing attack on her head ...

The positioning of the knife wounds on the skull indicated the victim had been facing her attacker throughout this initial assault; this was further supported by the wounds in the right forearm, which suggested the victim had raised her hands to protect herself from these knife blows (no flesh remained on the left hand or forearm to identify potential similar wounds).<ref>''Bodies of Evidence'' p. 42</ref> The head wounds had been inflicted on the left section of the skull and forehead, consistent with the attacker being a right-handed individual.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|pages=1926\u20131928|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref> Curiously, the tissues around the stab wounds in the victim's forearm and hand had been pulled outwards as the knife had been extracted\u2014indicating the end of the blade had a curved or hooked point,<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1926|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref> resembling a parrot's beak. Three of the wounds located on the top of the reconstructed skull were particularly distinctive, being circular [[Countersink|countersunk]] holes, further supporting this conclusion.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=21-23}}\n\nIn addition to these knife and blunt trauma injuries, the victim's jaw had also been broken and three teeth dislodged, although it was impossible to determine whether these injuries had been sustained through a fall or her being struck in the face. Furthermore, Simpson concluded all these injuries had been inflicted while the victim was alive and most probably conscious. In his view, Dr. Simpson concluded that, in view of the trauma sustained, the victim had received several stab wounds to the head as she faced her attacker, and that she had attempted to ward off these blows with her hands and arms before attempting to run from her assailant; she had then either stumbled to the ground or fainted, likely dislodging three of her teeth in the fall, before her murderer had inflicted the fatal blow to her skull, with this blow also shattering her cheek bone.<ref>''War Crimes: Underworld Britain in the Second World War'' p. 90</ref>\n\nThe extent of [[saponification]] of body fats in the remaining breast and thigh tissue of the victim, in conjunction with the continuous presence of heat generated by maggot infestation, led Dr. Simpson to revise the length of time the victim had lain undiscovered to one month, meaning the victim had died in early- to mid-September. Moreover, the extensive infestation of maggots indicated she had lain exposed to [[weather|the elements]] for a minimum of 24 hours before her murderer had buried her body.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Search of Hankley Common===\nOn 12 October, a search team consisting of 60 police constables discovered a heavy, tapered bough of birchwood approximately 350 yards from the burial site.<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 287\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|pages=1926\u20131927|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref> This bough had been sharpened at both ends,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and was found just 16 yards from a military [[tripwire]]. Upon closer inspection, investigators noted several short strands of blonde human hair crushed into the [[Bark (botany)|bark]], strongly indicating Wolfe had fallen to the ground at this location before her murderer had used this bough to inflict the vast depressed fracture to her skull. (This theory would be supported by Dr. Simpson, who confirmed the dimensions of this bough perfectly matched the cavity within the victim's skull, and that the hair samples upon the instrument matched those retrieved from her scalp.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=25\u201329}})\n\nThree days later, within a 400-yard radius of the burial site, these officers also discovered numerous personal artifacts belonging to the victim including her shoes and purse, a handbag containing a [[rosary]], a bar of soap, and a distinctive elephant charm.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/> In a [[dell (landform)|dell]] above where the tripwire and bough had been discovered, officers discovered a crucifix, a [[National Registration Act 1939|National Registration Card]] issued to one Joan Pearl Wolfe, a blank document issued by the Canadian Army to men requesting permission to marry, and a letter written by Wolfe to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier named August Sangret, informing him of her pregnancy, and her hopes of his agreeing to marry her.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Also found were a further fragment of the victim's skull, and a tooth.\n\nThe personal possessions belonging to the victim were identified by Edith Watts as belonging to her daughter. Furthermore, Superintendent Richard Webb had earlier recognised Wolfe's name, having interviewed her in both July and August after she had been taken into custody due to concerns for her welfare, due to her living on the common in makeshift shelters. On both occasions, she had worn a distinctive green-and-white dress like that discovered upon the body, and at Webb's own instigation, Wolfe had been sent to hospital. Furthermore, Webb was able to recall her companion had been the Canadian soldier mentioned in the letter discovered close to her body.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=24}}\n\n==Interrogation==\nFollowing the identification of Wolfe's body, Chief Inspector Greeno and Superintendent Richard Webb informally interviewed Sangret at the Godalming army camp where he was stationed on 12 October.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> In this interview, Sangret freely admitted to having dated Wolfe, but insisted he had not seen her since 14 September, when she had failed to keep a date with him. He had not taken their relationship too seriously, being more interested in a woman he had earlier met in [[Glasgow]]. Furthermore, although he had not reported Wolfe as missing to police, he had reported her disappearance to his Provost Sergeant. When shown articles of Wolfe's clothing, Sangret formally identified these garments as belonging to her.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nUpon interviewing Sangret's army colleagues, Inspector Greeno learned of the alternating and conflicting explanations he had given to these men as to Wolfe's disappearance, and that his demeanour had alternated between bouts of unperturbedness and anxiety over the previous weeks. Moreover, one colleague remarked to Greeno that, upon learning of the discovery of Wolfe's body, Sangret had seemed \"on edge\".<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n===Statement===\nGreeno subsequently requested permission from the army to take Sangret to Godalming police station to conduct a formal interview. This request was granted, and Sangret was taken to this police station later that day.\n\nAt Godalming police station, Sangret was asked whether he would tell all he knew of Wolfe, and his association with her. In response, he casually replied, \"Yes, all right.\" The subsequent 17,000-word verbal statement Sangret delivered would prove to be the then-longest statement ever made in British criminal history;{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=86}} taking a policeman four days to compose in longhand in interview sessions totaling almost 19 hours. These interviews were conducted between 12 and 16 October (on 15 October, no interviews were conducted due to Inspector Greeno being occupied with other police matters). In addition to formally interviewing Sangret on these dates, Greeno had Sangret show investigators the various locations he mentioned in his statement, such as Kate Hayter's bungalow, and the locations of the two wigwams he had constructed.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=134}} Throughout the days in which he was questioned, Sangret remained at the police station.\n\nIn his statement, Sangret discussed in exhaustive detail his relationship with Wolfe, and his actions following her disappearance. He did concede to having had an argument with Wolfe regarding his reluctance to marry her on the final occasion he had seen her,<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 288\"/> but denied having either caused her any harm, or any knowledge of her current whereabouts.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> When questioned as to the whereabouts of his army-issue knife, Sangret claimed he had given this instrument to Wolfe.\n\nAfter completing his statement on the morning of 16 October,<ref>{{cite news|title=Soldier on Murder Charge: Evidence of Leaves in North |date=14 January 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19430114&id=jzRAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TVkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5737,740235&hl=en |accessdate=4 February 2019|work=The Glasgow Herald}}</ref> Sangret was released, pending further inquiries.

His army blanket and uniform had been confiscated at Godalming police station, and sent to a Dr. Roche Lynch at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] to undergo [[Benzidine|Benzidine testing]]. Dr. Lynch was able to conclude that both the trousers and blanket had recently been washed in a basic and clumsy manner, and that each garment bore evidence of bloodstains.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Furthermore, Lynch was able to deduce that the positioning of the bloodstains within the army blanket was consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe's head and arm wounds, had she been wrapped in this garment.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1929|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 1942, a distinctive knife with a hooked point resembling a parrot's beak was discovered by a Private Albert Brown, hidden in a waste pipe within the wash-house at Witley barracks.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Brown had discovered this instrument when tasked with clearing a blocked drain; he and a colleague immediately handed this knife to Harold Wade, who in turn forwarded the weapon to the Surrey Police.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> (Subsequent [[witness|eyewitness]] testimony would indicate Sangret had excused himself to wash his hands in this wash-room on 12 October, immediately prior to his initial, informal questioning by Inspector Greeno. He had been alone in the wash-room for between three and four minutes, although the water had been cut off at the time.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=158}})\n\nThe knife itself was not of Canadian issue, but [[British Army]] (although subsequent trial testimony would confirm such a model of knife had been issued to the Canadian Army until 1939{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=102}}). A Canadian soldier named Samuel Crowle had found this knife embedded in a tree close to one of the wigwams Sangret had earlier constructed in mid-August; he had intended to keep the knife due to its unique blade, but had been advised by a colleague to deliver it to a Corporal Thomas Harding, who had in turn handed the knife to Sangret on 26 August, suspecting the knife had belonged to him, given that Crowle had informed him he had found the knife near a wigwam \"with some people talking inside\".<ref name=\"Tragic End of Joan the Wigwam Girl\"/>\n\nDr. Lynch subjected the knife to similar testing to which he had previously subjected Sangret's army blanket and uniform, although this knife\u2014having been immersed in a drainage system for over six weeks\u2014bore no evidence of bloodstains, hair samples or [[fingerprint]]s. Nonetheless, Doctors Eric Gardner and Keith Simpson each independently examined the weapon on 3 December and concluded only such a knife could have inflicted the wounds discovered on Wolfe's skull and arm.<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 288\">''On Trial for Murder'' p. 288</ref>\n\nOn 6 December, Inspector Greeno interviewed Sangret at the Aldershot barracks where he had recently been transferred, before requesting he accompany investigators to Hankley Common to pinpoint the locations he and Wolfe had lived and frequented. Sangret agreed to this request, although he resolutely refused to enter or even glance in the direction of Houndown Wood.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=92}} Upon returning to Godalming police station, Sangret agreed to submit to a second formal interview, in which Greeno focused largely upon issues regarding the knives he and Wolfe had owned. In this statement, Sangret stated Wolfe had been in possession of a black-handled knife with a hooked point, which she had been given by Francis Hearn. Shortly after 4 p.m. that afternoon, Sangret was formally charged with the murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe. He was held on [[remand (detention)|remand]] at [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]], to await [[committal procedure|committal hearing]]s.{{sfn|Quigley|2006|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n===Committal hearings===\nFormal committal hearings were held in Guildford between 12 and 20 January 1943, and saw 21 members of the Canadian Army testify as eyewitnesses to Sangret's relationship with Wolfe; his conflicting and indifferent accounts as to her whereabouts following her disappearance; his being in possession of the knife alleged to have been used in her murder; and his movements on critical dates. In addition, Doctors Simpson, Gardner and Lynch each testified as to their collective forensic findings upon Wolfe's body and Sangret's clothing and army blanket. Also to testify at these committal hearings was Inspector Greeno, who read in full Sangret's voluminous statements to the court before testifying as to Sangret's admission prior to his initial release from custody that he had deduced these official matters were in motion due to her body being found.<ref name=\"The Evening Citizen\"/>\n\nOn 20 January, [[Malcolm Macnaghten|Mr Justice Macnaghten]] declared enough evidence had been presented to warrant Sangret being brought to trial, and set a date of 24 February for the trial to commence at the [[Surrey County Hall]].<ref name=\"The Evening Citizen\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nThe trial of August Sangret for the murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe began at the [[Surrey County Hall]] on 24 February 1943. He was tried before Mr Justice Macnaghten and a jury. The [[Clerk of Assize|clerk of assize]] opened proceedings on this date by asking Sangret to stand to hear a formal recitation of the charge, and to state his [[plea]]. Sangret formally stated his plea of [[plea|not guilty]] to the charge against him; the Clerk then informed the jury: \"It is for you to say whether he is guilty or not guilty, and to hearken to the evidence.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=95}}\n\nIn his [[opening statement]] on behalf of [[the Crown]], Eric Neve outlined the prosecution's intention to prove beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] that Sangret had murdered Wolfe\u2014whom he referred to as ''the Wigwam Girl''\u2014on or about 14 September 1942.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soldier For Trial on Murder Charge |date=23 January 1943 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/49536250 |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=The Barrier Miner}}</ref> Neve then defined for the jury the very definition of the crime of murder, before outlining the relationship between the decedent and the accused; quoting from letters exchanged between the two and harking to the two wigwams Sangret had constructed on Hankley Common and in which he had lived with the decedent in the weeks prior to her murder.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wigwam Girl's Slayer on Trial |date=24 February 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19430224&id=7QUoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8iIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5901,1909391&hl=en |accessdate=4 February 2019|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal}}</ref> Neve further outlined the prosecution's [[main contention|contention]] that Sangret had constructed these wigwams with the same distinctive knife he had subsequently used in her murder, before displaying [[Exhibit (legal)|Exhibit]]s 3 and 4: the birch bough used to inflict the substantial fracture to the rear of her skull, and the distinctive black-handled knife with a hooked point, which he had attempted to conceal at Witley barracks.\n\nNeve further outlined that Sangret had told several conflicting stories of Wolfe's whereabouts in the weeks she had been missing, and that forensic experts would testify that only a distinctive knife such as Exhibit 4 could have inflicted the wounds discovered on Wolfe's forehead. Furthermore, Neve stated that bloodstains had been discovered on Sangret's trousers and army blanket, and that Dr. Roche Lynch would testify as to the positioning of the bloodstains found upon the army blanket being consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe's head and arm wounds, indicating Sangret had initially wrapped her body in this garment.\n\nSangret's lawyer, Linton Thorp, rejected the prosecution's contention that the knife alleged to have been the murder weapon had belonged to Sangret in his opening speech for the defence; emphasising his client's insistence that he had never owned such a knife and adding that the knife in question was of British Army issue as opposed to Canadian. Furthermore, Thorp added that a knife found some 23 paces from the murder scene had been discarded by a policeman who had initially attached no importance to the find, and that repeated searches to relocate this knife had been unsuccessful.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/>\n\nThorp further elaborated on Sangret's insistence he had loved Wolfe; informing the jurors that several letters written by Wolfe had been found in his possession at the time of his arrest and that, following her disappearance, Sangret had made efforts to locate her. Moreover, Thorp emphasised that Wolfe's history of liaising with soldiers in the two years prior to her murder, coupled with her solitary and nomadic lifestyle, meant any number of the 100,000 soldiers stationed in the vicinity of Witley and Thursley could have been her actual murderer.\n\n===Witness testimony===\nFormal witness testimony began on the first day of the trial, with 17 prosecution witnesses called to testify on this date, including the [[Superintendent (police)|Detective Superintendent]] of the Surrey Constabulary, who formally introduced into evidence the birch bough murder weapon found on Hankley Common the previous October, and the knife forwarded to Surrey Police by Provost Sergeant Harold Wade.<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 288\"/> Also to testify was Wolfe's mother, Edith Watts, who formally identified her daughter's crucifix, purse, and elephant charm which had all been found in and around the dell where her daughter had been attacked, and Sergeant Charles Hicks, who testified as to his regularly reading Wolfe's letters to Sangret, then composing his replies. Hicks further testified that Sangret had only informed him of Wolfe's disappearance on 27 September.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=97}}\n\nThe second day of the trial saw a further 20 prosecution witnesses called to testify, most of whom were military personnel [[subpoena|summons]]ed to testify as to Sangret's conduct with Wolfe prior to her murder, his evident reluctance to commit to the marriage Wolfe had evidently yearned for,<ref>{{cite news|title=Killed Girl to Escape Marriage, N.C.O.

One of these witnesses was Provost Sergeant Harold Wade, who testified that Sangret had only informed him of Wolfe's disappearance on 21 September, and that Sangret had informed him of the final conversation he had had with Wolfe prior to her disappearance on this date. According to Wade, when Wolfe\u2014weeping openly\u2014had asked Sangret whether he \"care[d] to marry [her] or not\", Sangret had responded, \"No, I don't\". Upon hearing this, Wade testified he had advised Sangret to simply forget her, to which Sangret had replied the reason for his visit was that, had anything happened to Wolfe, he did not wish to be involved in the matter.\n\nAlso called to testify on this date was Private Samuel Crowle, who had found the knife introduced as Exhibit 4 close to the second wigwam Sangret had constructed on Hankley Common the previous August. Crowle formally identified the knife as being that which he had discovered on the common and had briefly retained before handing to his superior due to its distinctive blade and a \"little nick\" he had noted the knife bore.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=154}} In addition to Crowle's testimony, an American soldier named Raymond Deadman also testified on 25 February as to his becoming acquainted with Wolfe in the week prior to her murder, and to his observing Sangret's [[ownership|possessive]] nature. In response to questioning by Eric Neve, Deadman explained he had become acquainted with Wolfe on 4 September, and that she had introduced him to Sangret on this date. The following day, he had walked across the common in her company, before they had encountered Sangret, who, Deadman testified, had become angry at seeing her in his company. According to Deadman, Sangret then chided a visibly nervous Wolfe for leaving \"the shack\" without his permission.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=100}}\n\nOne of the final witnesses to testify on the second day of the trial was Private Joseph Arsenault, who had been stationed at Witley Camp between July and October 1942, and had become acquainted with Sangret. Arsenault testified as to his observing Sangret, alone, cleaning his trousers in the camp wash-room in an effort to remove dark stains he (Arsenault) had seen on the garment. In response to [[cross-examination]] by Linton Thorp, Arsenault conceded he could not pinpoint the precise date he had seen Sangret washing his trousers in the wash-room, and that the date in question could have been anytime he had been stationed at Witley Camp.\n\nThe knife the prosecution contended had inflicted the distinctive injuries to Wolfe's forehead was introduced in evidence as Exhibit 4, with Corporal Thomas Harding testifying as to his handing this weapon to Sangret on 26 August. In response to questioning by his defence, Sangret denied he had ever seen the knife introduced into evidence, and claimed he had never being given such a weapon by Corporal Harding.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=91}} Furthermore, Sangret described the knife he had used to construct both wigwams as belonging to Wolfe. This weapon, he claimed, had both a [[marlin spike]] and a can opener, and he had been informed by Wolfe that the knife had been given to her by Francis Hearn. In addition, Sangret insisted he had never taken his own army-issue knife off barracks.\n\nTwo of the prosecution's main witnesses were Drs Keith Simpson and Eric Gardner, who testified on the second and third days of the trial respectively. Both pathologists testified as to the recovery of Wolfe's body\u2014which they noted had been \"covered, rather than buried\"\u2014and their subsequent examination of her remains, both [[in situ]] on the common, and\u2014with regards to Dr. Simpson\u2014at Guy's Hospital. With the aid of enlarged photographs of the wounds discovered upon Wolfe's skull, Dr. Simpson testified that only a knife such as that with the \"peculiarities\" of the one discovered hidden in the waste pipe at Witley barracks could have inflicted the distinctive circular wounds discovered upon Wolfe's skull. In relation to the partially extracted muscle tissue and [[ligament]]s discovered in the victim's right forearm and hand, Simpson confirmed such trauma could only have occurred through a distinctive, hooked blade retaining the tissue upon extraction.\n\nAgainst [[Objection (law)|overruled]] objections from Linton Thorp, Dr. Simpson then retrieved Wolfe's skull from a cardboard box to demonstrate for the jury just how this knife fitted the wounds discovered in Wolfe's skull, and how the channel tracts to the right of each wound again matched the dimensions of Exhibit 4. Simpson also explained to the jury how the positioning of these wounds indicated she had likely been facing her right-handed attacker when these wounds were delivered.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=104\u2013105}} Although both Simpson and Gardner conceded the knife introduced as Exhibit 4 may not have been the actual murder weapon as opposed to another, precise replica issue, both pathologists dismissed the possibility that any standard-issue American or Canadian Army knife presented before them could have created these distinctive, countersink wounds. (No other soldier stationed at Witley Camp had been in possession of such a weapon.)\n\nFollowing the testimony of Dr. Gardner, Dr. Roche Lynch took the witness stand to discuss the results of the Benzidine tests he had conducted upon Sangret's army blanket, uniform, water-bottle, and the knife discovered at Witley barracks. Lynch testified that both the uniform and blanket had recently been washed, albeit clumsily. Nonetheless, through conducting Benzidine tests upon each garment, he had concluded each bore evidence of bloodstains, whereas no blood had been discovered on the knife or water-bottle.\n\nIn cross-examination of Dr. Lynch, Linton Thorp did succeed in getting Lynch to concede the washing of the garments in question prior to their examination meant he (Lynch) could not definitively state these stains had originated from human blood.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=107}} Thorp then attempted to suggest these stains, if sourcing from human blood, may have been caused through human scratching through [[louse|lice]] infestation; Dr. Lynch countered this assertion by stating it would be physically impossible to produce such extensive staining through scratching.\n\n===Defence testimony===\nOn 26 February, Linton Thorp called Sangret to testify on his own behalf (this testimony would last until 1 March). In response to questioning from his counsel, Sangret chronologically discussed his two-month courtship with Wolfe, the improvised homes he had built for her, and their marriage plans. In a direct contradiction to the earlier testimony of several of his colleagues and Provost Sergeant Harold Wade (whom he contended were simply lying{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=176}}), Sangret claimed he had fully intended to marry Wolfe, and denied either arguing with her on the final occasion he had seen her on 13 September, or ever refusing to marry her.<ref>{{cite news|title=Knife Was Not His: Soldier's Denial in Murder Charge |date=2 March 1943 |url=https://www1.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1943-03-01/1943-03-07?basicsearch=august%20sangret&exactsearch=false&county=gloucestershire%2c%20england&country=england&retrievecountrycounts=false&mostspecificlocation=gloucestershire%2c%20england |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=Gloucester Citizen}}</ref> In relation to the knife Corporal Thomas Harding had given to him on 26 August, Sangret emphatically denied he had been given the knife the prosecution contended he had used in her murder on this date, and insisted he had been given a distinctly different, Canadian-issue knife introduced into evidence as Exhibit 34.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=156}}\n\nUpon completion of defence counsel questioning, Sangret was subjected to an intense cross-examination by Eric Neve, who repeatedly raised the inconsistencies, contradictions and \"convenience\" in Sangret's claims\u2014both in his trial testimony and the two statements he had given to Inspector Greeno\u2014as opposed to the witness testimony and forensic evidence presented. These questions related to such issues as Sangret's accounts of his whereabouts both before and after Wolfe's disappearance; his evident infidelity in light of his claims of his intentions to marry her; his claims he had never argued with Wolfe; his denial of ever being in possession of the knife introduced into evidence; and the numerous, differing, earlier explanations he had given to his colleagues and his Provost Sergeant as to Wolfe's disappearance.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=109}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nThe trial of August Sangret lasted nine days, and saw 52 witnesses testify on behalf of the prosecution, with only Sangret himself testifying in his own defence. Following the conclusion of Neve's cross-examination of Sangret on 2 March, both prosecution and defence attorneys delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Eric Neve outlined the testimony presented by forensic experts, investigators and Sangret's fellow servicemen on behalf of the prosecution; all of which Neve asserted, when combined, sufficiently proved Sangret had slain \"this unfortunate girl\" before vainly attempting to establish an alibi and conceal the murder weapon.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/>\n\nFollowing the prosecution's closing argument, Linton Thorp argued on behalf of the defence. In his closing argument, Thorp reiterated his client's love for Wolfe, and stated that all evidence and testimony presented by the prosecution was [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]]. Thorp further emphasised to the jury that no conclusive proof existed that Sangret had murdered Wolfe.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/>\n\nUpon completion of both counsels' closing arguments, Macnaghten delivered his final instructions to the jury: \"That the girl was murdered is not in dispute; that she was murdered by some man is also quite plain. The only question you have to determine is: Have the Crown satisfied you beyond all real doubt that the prisoner, August Sangret, is the man who murdered her? I can only conclude by saying what I said at the beginning: when dealing with a case of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied beyond all doubt before you find the prisoner is guilty.\"<ref>''War Crimes'' p. 171</ref>\n\nFollowing this final instruction from Macnaghten, the jury retired to consider their verdict, taking Wolfe's skull and the knife alleged by the prosecution to have inflicted the preliminary stab wounds to her body to assist in their deliberations.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1931|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\n==Conviction==\nThe jury deliberated for two hours before announcing they had reached their verdict: Sangret was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of Wolfe's murder, although this verdict was accompanied with a strong recommendation as to mercy.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Passing sentence, Mr Justice Macnaghten donned his formal [[black cap]] and made the following speech:\n\n{{cquote|August Sangret, the jury have found that it was you who murdered Joan Wolfe, and none who heard the evidence can doubt the justice of the verdict. They have accompanied it with a strong recommendation for mercy; that will be forwarded to the proper quarter. It only remains for me to pronounce the sentence prescribed by law.\n\nThe sentence of the court is that you be taken from here to the place from whence you came, and from there to a place of lawful execution, and that there you be hanged by the neck until you be dead; and that your body afterwards be buried within the precincts of the prison in which you shall have been last confined. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=111}}}}\n\nBefore Macnaghten passed this death sentence, Sangret was asked by the clerk of assize whether he wished to address the court. In response, Sangret declared: \"I am not guilty, sir. I never killed that girl.\"<ref>''Sentence of Death For Murder of Girl.'' [[The Times]] 3 March 1943 p8 column D</ref>\n\n===Appeal===\nFollowing his conviction, August Sangret uncustomarily filed a [[appeal|notice of appeal]] against his sentence on his own behalf, without first consulting his defence counsel.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=140}} His appeal was heard on 13 April before three judges in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]: the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] (the [[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Viscount Caldecote]]), [[Travers Humphreys|Mr Justice Humphreys]], and [[Wilfrid Lewis|Mr Justice Lewis]]. As was customary, both original counsels were present at this hearing, although as Sangret's appeal had been filed without his first consulting with his defence counsel, neither Linton Thorp or his co-counsel, Laurence Vine, were able to challenge either the trial conduct or the verdict beyond the contents of Sangret's personal appeal (in which he had simply stated his disagreement with the guilty verdict, proclaimed his innocence, and claimed that he had not owned the knife identified as being used in Wolfe's murder). Nonetheless, Thorp did emphasise the jury's strong recommendation to mercy.\n\nThe same day they had convened to hear Sangret's appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction, ruling there had been no evidence presented to attest to either trial misconduct or Sangret's innocence, adding they had further chosen to summarily dismiss the appeal due to \"the abundance of evidence the appellant was the murderer of the girl\", further stating there had been \"no possible ground on which the verdict could be disturbed\".<ref>''Court of Criminal Appeal, Murder of a Girl: Appeal Dismissed.'' [[The Times]] 13 Apr 1943 p.2, col.

Like others in authority before him, Webb had noted her as being \"in need of protection\" and, on the occasion he had seen her, had observed her as being \"somewhat dirty\". Webb testified to having repeatedly spoken with Wolfe in great detail; noting her soft-spoken and quiet manner. In defence of her character, Webb conceded that, although her lifestyle was somewhat immoral, she had been fiercely loyal to any one soldier at a time, in the hope he would marry her and provide her with the eventual security and stability she desired.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=80}}\n* In his [[memoirs]], published in 1960, Inspector Edward Greeno confided his conducting the formal interview with Sangret at Godalming police station on 12 October had subsequently proven illegal, as Sangret had been held without charge for five days\u2014four days longer than the law of [[habeas corpus]] allowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/uk.php#f1|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: United Kingdom|date=1 January 2012|via=loc.gov}}</ref> Greeno confided he had been extremely concerned this issue may have been raised in court, adding that, prior to trial, he had been contacted by then-[[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Assistant Commissioner]] [[Norman Kendal|Sir Norman Kendal]] on this very issue. However, for reasons unknown, neither Linton Thorp or his co-counsel, Laurence Vine, chose to raise this issue at Sangret's trial or subsequent appeal.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=108}}\n* Despite his conceding the case against Sangret may have been \"flung out [of court] then and there\" had Sangret's defence raised the issue of his breaching the law of habeas corpus, Greeno nonetheless reiterated his conviction of Sangret's guilt in what he recollected as being \"nearly the [[perfect crime]]: a murder not only unsolved, but undiscovered.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=145}} Greeno did, however, theorise as to Sangret's motive:<blockquote>I had interviewed thousands of people in this case, and seventy-four of them went into the witness-box. The case was so watertight that, as Sir Norman Kendal said later, Sangret's appeal against the death sentence was almost a [[farce]]. One small doubt remained: Sangret murdered the girl because she was expecting his child\u2014but was she? Was she expecting anybody's child? The doctors didn't think so on the occasion that the police sent her to hospital, and when her body was found, it was too late to tell. But this is certain: Sangret did murder her. He confessed before he died ... It is never announced when a murderer confesses. But why not? There are always [[crank (person)|cranks]] and [[Pseudoscience|crackpots]] to argue that some wicked policeman has framed some poor fellow. So why make an official secret of the fact that the policeman did his job?{{sfn|Greeno|1960|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n==Media==\n* The case of ''the Wigwam Murder'' has twice been dramatised by British radio [[scriptwriter]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Harry Alan Towers]].

In addition to [[English language|English]], Sangret spoke the [[Cree language]] fluently, and learned some of the traditional skills of his ancestors in his youth, some of which were honed throughout the years he worked as a farm labourer in the town of [[Maidstone, Saskatchewan|Maidstone]] in the 1920s.

This [[militia]] regiment trained for just two weeks each year, and Sangret served with this regiment until 1939.\n\n===Wolfe===\nJoan Pearl Wolfe was born in [[Tonbridge, Kent]], on 11 March 1923, the oldest of three children born to Edith and Charles Wolfe.\nThroughout her childhood, Wolfe lived modestly with her parents in a strict [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] household in this market town. In 1928, she and her family moved from Tonbridge to [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]]. While the family resided in Tunbridge Wells, Joan attended a [[convent school]] in nearby [[Rotherfield#Mark Cross|Mark Cross]], with her tuition fees reportedly paid by a wealthy aunt.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=51\u201352}} She attended this convent school until age 16, becoming fluent in the [[French language]], and although outwardly [[pious]] and known to regularly wear a conspicuous [[crucifix]] about her neck, she apparently lacked any serious religious commitment.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=53\u201357}}\n\nWolfe's father, Charles, was known locally as an [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] figure, who suffered from [[insomnia]] and was prone to sudden public outbursts of paranoia and hostility; he committed suicide in 1930 by gassing himself while Joan attended the Mark Cross convent school. Following her husband's suicide, Wolfe's mother subsequently remarried, and later bore a fourth child.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=50}}\n\nWith her mother's approval, Wolfe became [[engagement|engaged]] to an affluent young man from Tunbridge Wells shortly before her 16th birthday in 1939. Reportedly, Joan's fianc\u00e9 lavished his attention and affections on her,{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=52}} although later the same year, while still engaged, Wolfe first ran away from home.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=52}} On this first occasion, her mother reported her daughter missing to police, and Joan was discovered approximately one month later in the town of [[Aldershot]]. She was driven back to Tunbridge Wells by her fianc\u00e9's mother, although shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Wolfe chose to call off her engagement and instead travel to [[London]] to train as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=53}}\n\nAfter one month, Wolfe left this employment, but did not inform her mother of this fact. It is at this stage in her life in which Wolfe's behaviour is believed to have become increasingly irresponsible and promiscuous, and she is known to have subsequently engaged in casual affairs with several soldiers between 1940 and 1942, most of whom served with the [[Canadian Army]]. Wolfe's behaviour from 1940 onward attests to her being gullible, extremely [[naivety|na\u00efve]], prone to flights of fancy, yet apparently yearning for stability. Her na\u00efvety may have been compounded by her heavily [[chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] convent upbringing. These facts are evidenced not only in her behaviour, but in the content of the numerous letters she is known to have written to her final lover, who would ultimately prove to be her murderer. Moreover, until her death, she neither drank, smoked<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\">{{cite news|title=The War's Best True Detective Story |date=13 June 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19430613&id=yCBPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cE0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5835,5971574&hl=en |accessdate=3 February 2019|publisher=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref> or used any profane language in her vocabulary.<ref name=\"Hooked Knife Led to Killer\">{{cite news|title=Hooked Knife Led to Killer |date=28 August 1982 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19820828&id=cb4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8O4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2288,3764499&hl=en |accessdate=3 February 2019|publisher=The Ottawa Citizen}}</ref>\n\nAlthough little beyond subsequent trial testimony is known of Wolfe's relationship with her mother, the evidence which exists attests to Edith Watts being a simple, caring woman, gradually driven to despair by her eldest daughter's increasingly unpredictable and irresponsible behaviour; however, Wolfe herself may have found her mother's attitude somewhat overbearing.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=80}} Nonetheless, via letter and in person, Edith is known to have repeatedly implored her daughter to return to or remain at home, and to revert to a stable, respectable lifestyle. In addition, contrary to Wolfe's claims that those in positions of authority had seldom made any serious efforts to help her, the police\u2014occasionally at Edith's urging\u2014did intervene on several occasions out of concern for her welfare, and she was repeatedly offered various forms of assistance, but would inevitably revert to her somewhat nomadic lifestyle.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=79\u201381}}\n\nDespite her wayward lifestyle, Joan did remain sporadic written correspondence with her mother between 1940 and 1942, and she is known to have infrequently returned home to Tunbridge Wells for brief periods\u2014twice in the company of Canadian soldiers she was dating\u2014to visit her family,{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=61\u201363}} before opting to return to [[Godalming]] or [[Guildford]]. She is known to have held several menial forms of employment from 1940 onward; alternately residing in cheap lodgings or sleeping rough. Wolfe is also known to have formed a close friendship with an elderly lady named Kate Hayter in the village of [[Thursley]] while she lived and worked in Godalming. According to Wolfe, Hayter allowed her sleep at her [[bungalow]], and to both wash and change her clothes, when she was unemployed.<ref name=\"Guildford' p. 111\">''Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths in Guildford'' p. 111</ref>\n\nOn each occasion Edith wrote to or spoke with her daughter, she would argue with Joan as to her irresponsible and promiscuous lifestyle. By 1942, the relationship between mother and daughter had deteriorated and, in May, Edith wrote a final letter to her daughter, informing her she was \"finished with you. I have been more than fair to you; forgiven you for things no other mother would have done ... You said something about repaying me for all I have done for you ... Joan, I shall be paid in full the day you come and truthfully say, 'Mum, I'm going to be a good girl'. Joan, that will be the happiest day of my life.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=55}}\n\n==War years==\nOn 19 June 1940, nine months after Canada had proclaimed her intention to join the war effort, Sangret chose to enlist as a full-time soldier in the [[The Royal Regina Rifles|Regina Rifle Regiment]]. Shortly thereafter, his regiment was transferred to [[CFAD Dundurn|Dundurn Camp]]. His career as a soldier is marred with several blemishes, and he was repeatedly punished for both minor and major infractions of military discipline, including several instances in which he was reported [[absent without leave]] (although no record exists of Sangret ever being returned to barracks against his will.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=128}}) Throughout his military service, he never advanced beyond the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/records/2292043/private-august-sangret-canadian-army-royal-canadian-infantry-corps/|title=Record Details for August Sangret|date=1 January 2013|via=forces-war-records.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nSangret's regiment was deployed to Britain on 24 March 1942. He was initially stationed in [[Fleet, Hampshire]], before being posted to Aldershot and, on 13 July, to Jasper Camp.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tweedsmuirmilitarycamp.co.uk/r%26e.html |title=Tweedsmuir Military Camp.co.uk |access-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060611/http://www.tweedsmuirmilitarycamp.co.uk/r%26e.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This final posting was in the market town of Godalming, and Sangret became one of an estimated 100,000 soldiers stationed in the vicinity of [[Witley]] and Thursley in 1942.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=145}} At Jasper Camp, Sangret enrolled in a newly formed 12-week educational course for soldiers lacking in elementary education. While stationed in Godalming, Sangret became acquainted with Joan Pearl Wolfe.<ref name=\"Murder on Hankley Common\"/>\n\nThe same year Sangret's regiment was posted to Britain, Joan Wolfe became engaged to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier named Francis Hearn, who returned to Canada on 15 July, having previously promised to marry her (which he had likely known was improbable due to his imminent posting to Canada). Wolfe is known to have thereafter worn a ring given to her by Hearn, and to have occasionally referred to herself as his wife. On one occasion, she is known to have falsely informed a female acquaintance she and Hearn had married in London, and that she and he were both \"heartbroken\" at his being posted back to Canada.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=56}}\n\n===Acquaintance and courtship===\nOn 17 July 1942, the day after Hearn left for Canada, Joan Wolfe and August Sangret met for the first time in a [[public house|pub]] in Godalming. According to Sangret, he had first noted Wolfe when she walked toward a bar and ordered a lemonade, to which he had asked her when she subsequently sat near him whether she was able to purchase \"anything stronger\", and Wolfe\u2014whom he described as being \"rather scruffy\" and downcast in spirit\u2014had simply replied that she \"didn't drink anything stronger\".{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=62}} He and Wolfe had then begun to talk, and later walked through a local park, before engaging in [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] in a field close to the [[River Wey]]. The two then parted company, having arranged to meet again. As would often subsequently occur, Wolfe did not keep her next date, but Sangret and a fellow soldier named Hartnell did by chance encounter her outside a Godalming [[fish and chip shop]] on 21 July. Wolfe had apparently agreed to date Hartnell on this evening, but became notably upset when Hartnell suggested tossing a coin to determine whether he or Sangret should \"have her\" that evening.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=64}} In response, Hartnell simply left Wolfe and Sangret, and the pair were briefly detained by police, before being released. Sangret took Wolfe to the undergrowth close to [[Witley Camp]] that evening, and on this date, upon being informed by Wolfe she had \"nowhere to stay\", constructed the first [[wigwam]] for he and Wolfe to meet. Sangret described this first temporary shelter as being \"a little shack with limbs and stuff.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=64}} He spent the night with Wolfe in this device, returning to barracks at 6 a.m., having given Joan his photograph, address, and arranging to meet her in Godalming that evening. He later furnished this spartan pine structure with army blankets.<ref name=\"Guildford' p. 111\"/>\n\nSangret and Wolfe subsequently met on a regular\u2014yet unreliable\u2014basis in which he would meet her at approximately 7 p.m., then return to barracks to answer the 10 p.m. [[wikt:roll call|roll call]], before returning to the wigwam (which he referred to as \"the shack\") to spend the night with her. Early in their courtship, this first wigwam he had constructed was discovered, and Wolfe evicted from the structure; in response, Sangret constructed a second, larger device for he and Wolfe to meet in his off-duty hours, again constructed using the traditional skills of his Cree ancestors he had honed in his youth, and again located close to his base on [[Hankley Common]] (then an army training ground regularly used for military exercises). Each structure was devised from long poles, saplings and branches covered by sheets of [[birch bark]] and [[bracken]]. The tools used for constructing these shelters included a small, crooked knife that is unique to the Cree.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=112}}\n\nOn 23 July, Wolfe was admitted to hospital, having fainted in a Guildford street. She informed Sangret of this fact in a letter, imploring him to visit her (Sangret did attempt to visit on this date, but missed official visiting hours and was thus refused entry). Three days later, she wrote a second letter to Sangret,<ref>{{cite news|title=Killed Girl to Escape Marriage, NCO Alleges |date=25 January 1943 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/212232355 |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=The Evening Advocate}}</ref> reading in part:\n\n{{cquote|My Dear August,\nWell, I hope you are well, as I have not seen or heard from you. It is so very lonely here without anyone to speak to, and there is so much I want to tell you. They are going to try and get me somewhere to stay in Godalming, or if this is not possible, in Guildford. Just one week has passed since I have known you, dear. It seems such a long time. I hope you will try and come and see me [in hospital], as I want to tell you when I can come out because someone will have to meet me, and you are all I have in the world. Of course if you don't want to come I shall understand, August, but I am sure I shall never understand men. I do not know enough about them, but I can live and learn. Anyway, I am pretty sure we are going to have a tiny wee one, maybe that is why you do not want to come and see me because you think that? I hope not anyway, but dear, I would not blame you one little bit, if you did not want to marry me because I really am too young, and too old-fashioned to be married. I regret what we did now it is too late, for I still say it is wicked. I guess you think I am silly, and I suppose I am, but remember I was brought up in a strict Catholic school. We were taught to have a baby before you were married was a sin. I do not know anything about babies. Well, I suppose I shall have to close this letter now, so au revoir (daddy). God bless you always dear. Joan.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=66}} }}\n\n(Although [[pathology|pathologists]] who later examined Wolfe's body were unable to determine whether she had been pregnant at the time of her death, had she been so at the time she wrote this letter on 26 July, Sangret\u2014having known Wolfe for just nine days\u2014could not have fathered the child. If Wolfe was indeed pregnant, the father of the child would likely have been Francis Hearn.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=172}})\n\n[[File:Hankley Common - geograph.org.uk - 1250043.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Hankley Common]]. Joan Wolfe lived in two separate wigwams constructed by August Sangret on this [[Common land|common]] between July and August 1942]]\nWhen Wolfe was released from hospital on 28 July, the couple continued to spend a great deal of time together within the wigwam he had constructed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Death Sentence in ''Wigwam\" Case |date=4 March 1943 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11335115 |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=The Argus}}</ref> On 31 July, she briefly obtained employment in a factory constructing [[Barrage balloon#Second World War|barrage balloons]], earning [[\u00a3]]2 10[[shilling|s]] per week, but lost this job as a result of poor timekeeping just three days later; she then informed Sangret of her desire to return to her mother's home, but was unwilling to do so until she had received written permission from her mother. When she received no reply from her mother, Wolfe briefly drifted to London in search of work, but returned to the wigwam after approximately three days. Shortly thereafter, the couple were discovered by a soldier attached to the military police named Donald Brett. Brett instructed Sangret to dismantle the wigwam, and Wolfe\u2014residing on army territory\u2014to move away from the area. Sangret did deconstruct this first wigwam, and almost immediately constructed a second device just 800 [[yard]]s from where he had built the first. This second device was constructed by Sangret in mid- to late-August, using birch saplings and tied with parcel string he had stolen from barracks, although he later claimed he and Wolfe had lived in this second wigwam for just two nights, before the pair had scoured the village of Witley on 23 August, in an unsuccessful search for lodgings.<ref name=\"Century Murder' p. 482\">''World Encyclopedia of 20th Century Murder'' p. 482</ref>\n\nThat same evening the pair had searched for lodgings, Sangret was detained by the [[Military Police#United Kingdom|military police]], and Wolfe escorted by the [[Surrey Police]] to a Guildford hospital (where she would remain until 1 September) in order that she would be in a safe and secure environment. At 11 a.m. the following morning, Sangret was arrested by the military police upon the charge of illegally keeping a girl within the camp precincts.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=69}} The pair were allowed to talk with one-another via telephone, and Joan emphasised to a civilian policeman present that the pair intended to wed. Sangret himself is known to have visited his commanding officer on 24 August, seeking official permission to marry Joan, although he was informed he would need both her mother's approval due to her technical status as a minor, and official permission from the Canadian government.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=71}} (Sangret was provided with a formal marriage application form, but never sought assistance from his colleagues in completing and returning this document.)\n\nOn one occasion in which Sangret visited Wolfe at the Guidford hospital prior to her absconding on 1 September, he was informed by Wolfe herself that doctors who had examined her were \"uncertain\" whether she was pregnant.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=149}}\n\n==September 1942==\nOn 1 September, Wolfe obtained a one-day pass to leave Guildford hospital, informing the matron of her intentions to visit the cinema and shop for new clothes. She never returned to the hospital; instead returning to Sangret, before spending the night sleeping alone in the waiting rooms at [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford railway station]].\n\nWolfe subsequently moved into an abandoned [[cricket pavilion]] in Thursley on or about 3 September,<ref name=\"Hooked Knife Led to Killer\"/> with Sangret providing her with an army-issue blanket and water-bottle stolen from his barracks on this date. In this pavilion, Wolfe would spend extended periods of time, often composing romantic poetry and letters (several of which were smattered with religious overtones), and making childlike drawings of the home into which she evidently envisioned herself and Sangret moving following their marriage. One of these drawings was made on the wall of the cricket pavilion, beneath which an inscription read: 'J. Wolfe now Mrs. Sangret. England. September 9, 1942'.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=60}}\n\nThroughout the two weeks in which Joan Wolfe resided within the abandoned cricket pavilion, Sangret visited her with increasing frequency; often when he should have been at base. He regularly brought food for he and Joan to eat together as they discussed their future plans, including the marriage Wolfe evidently yearned for.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=68}} When they could not meet, Wolfe would send letters to Sangret that would be read to him by a Sergeant Charles Hicks, who would then compose Sangret's replies. The tone and style of Wolfe's letters to Sangret is typically na\u00efve, yet optimistic, and is reminiscent of the letter she had composed on 26 July, with repeated references to her time spent in his company, her hopes for marriage, her general loneliness (which Wolfe is known to have referred to as her \"[[penance]]\"<ref name=\"Tragic End of Joan the Wigwam Girl\"/>), and her desire to be in his company. On at least one occasion, however, Wolfe does hark toward her frustration at Sangret's apparently repeated accusations of [[infidelity]], to which she wrote: \"You know I am in a safe place now anyway, and you will not be able to accuse me of going out with other soldiers. I have never done it since I have known you anyway, but you are so damned jealous you think it; but still we will forget all that now and look forward to the future, when we are married.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=71}}\n\nAs had been the case in July, Wolfe did obtain employment on more than one occasion in the final weeks of her life, but would invariably be fired after a matter of days or weeks due to her unreliability as an employee. To earn money on the numerous occasions she was unemployed, Wolfe\u2014occasionally accompanied by Sangret\u2014would gather blackberries on Hankley Common, which Sangret would sell to his army colleagues for up to 7 [[shilling]]s. Evidently, Wolfe spent some of this money on knitting provisions, as she is known to have knitted several baby clothes in the final weeks of her life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Murder on the Home Front: A True Story of Morgues, Murderers, and Mysteries'' ch. 11</ref>\n\nOn two successive days in the week before her murder, Wolfe was seen by a local resident named William Featherby picking blackberries on the edge of the [[common land|common]], and cooking vegetables over an open fire. On the second of these two occasions, Sangret had been inside the pavilion. The last known individual to see Joan Wolfe alive was a woman named Alice Curtis, who observed Wolfe, in the company of a \"dark-complexioned\" soldier with black hair, walking towards the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Brook, Surrey|Brook]] on Sunday, 13 September.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=82}}\n\n===Disappearance===\nBy 14 September, the relationship between Sangret and Wolfe had lasted 60 days. On this date, Joan Pearl Wolfe disappeared. According to Sangret's subsequent trial testimony, as he returned from the pavilion to barracks that morning, Joan had informed him of her intentions to return to Kate Hayter's Thursley residence. That evening, Sangret and a fellow soldier named Joseph Wells decided to visit a Thursley pub. On two occasions that evening, Sangret is known to have left Wells alone in the pub as he returned to the cricket pavilion. Each time he returned, he explained to Wells he had been searching for Wolfe out of concern for her welfare. On one of these occasions, he did not return for over 30 minutes.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=75}}\n\nIn an apparent effort to construct an [[alibi]], Sangret visited the home of Kate Hayter on 15 September, inquiring whether she had seen Joan, and leaving the pink baby clothes Wolfe had knitted in the weeks prior to her murder in Hayter's possession.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=78}} The same evening, he informed Wells his water-bottle and knife were missing, and that he suspected both items were in Wolfe's possession.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=102}}\n\nSangret is known to have given several conflicting explanations as to Wolfe's whereabouts to his army colleagues in the weeks following her disappearance: to some, he claimed Joan had simply returned home and the \"wedding is off\"; to others, he claimed Joan was in hospital. Furthermore, he is also known to have visited his [[Provost Sergeant]], Harold Wade, on 21 September, ostensibly seeking official assistance in his search for Wolfe. To Wade, Sangret confided he and Joan had \"quarrelled\" after he had informed her of his indifferent attitude to marriage. In response to this explanation, Wade questioned Sangret as to why he should be so concerned as to Joan's whereabouts, given that he evidently had no intentions of marrying her. To this, Sangret had replied: \"If she should be found, and anything has happened to her, I don't want to be mixed up with it.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1928|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nWithin weeks of Wolfe's disappearance, Sangret had begun casually dating local women. As had been the case when he corresponded via letter with Joan Wolfe, he asked his army colleagues to compose his replies due to his illiteracy. One of these colleagues to compose letters for Sangret was a [[sapper]] named Clarence Bear, whom Sangret asked to write a letter to a woman with whom he intended to spend an upcoming period of [[Leave (military)|leave]].{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=84}} When Bear voiced his concerns as to the implications this behaviour may have upon his relationship with Joan Wolfe, Sangret had replied, \"She'll never find out.\"<ref name=\"The Evening Citizen\">{{cite news|title=Indian Soldier is Tried for Death of \"Wigwam Girl\" |date=13 January 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19430111&id=wfwuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AdwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4375,1984591&hl=en |accessdate=2 February 2019|publisher=The Evening Citizen}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nAt 10:20&nbsp;a.m. on 7 October 1942, two [[Royal Marine]]s named William Moore and Geoffrey Cooke, patrolling a section of Hankley Common known as Houndown Wood on a routine military exercise, passed a high mound of earth which had been purposely bulldozed to simulate training upon rough terrain for tank crews. Protruding through the soil of a freshly dug patch of earth on a slope,<ref name=\"Century Murder' p. 482\"/> Moore observed what appeared to be an exposed human arm. Looking closer at the hand of this exposed limb, he further noted that the flesh upon two of the fingers and the thumb had been gnawed away by rats or other vermin, and that a foot also protruded from the earth.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n[[File:Cedric Keith Simpson CBE.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Keith Simpson (professor)|Dr. Keith Simpson]], the pathologist who conducted the autopsy of Joan Wolfe's body]]\nMoore and his colleague did not interfere with the body, but immediately returned to base to report their find to their sergeant. Subsequently, Lieutenant Norman McLeod inspected the site of their discovery, and immediately called the police. The first officers at the scene were Superintendents Richard Webb and Thomas Roberts of Surrey Police; both men deduced the experience of [[Scotland Yard]] was required, and cordoned off the area until the arrival that afternoon of Detective Chief Inspector Edward Greeno and Detective Sergeant Fred Hodge.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1924|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nAt the request of Superintendent Webb, Dr. Eric Gardner, pathologist to the Surrey County Coroner,{{sfn|Quigley|2006|pp=242-243}} and [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] [[Keith Simpson (professor)|Dr. Keith Simpson]] were both summoned to conduct the excavation of the remains.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=15}} Both men arrived at the crime scene the following day.\n\nThe victim was dressed in a green-and-white summer frock with a lace collar and woolen ankle-socks. Her underclothes had not been removed, suggesting that she had not been subjected to a [[sexual assault]] prior to her murder. She was lying face down in a shallow, makeshift grave which had later been disturbed by a passing military vehicle, possibly a [[half-track]], which had loosened the soil and exposed her arm and foot. The left arm was folded beneath the chest, with the exposed right arm notably outstretched, indicating the victim had likely been dragged to the location where she lay.\n\nThe body itself was badly [[decomposition|decomposed]], with the head, chest and abdominal cavity described by Simpson as being a \"seething mass of maggots\", which had eaten much of the soft body tissue, including the head and neck, save for a small section of scalp and hair.<ref>''Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century'' p.243</ref> A headscarf was found knotted around the victim's neck, but the knot itself was extremely slack, instantly enabling both men to dismiss [[strangulation]] as the cause of death; instead, both men strongly speculated the cause of death had been the extensive [[blunt trauma]] to the skull, which had \"all but collapsed\" in the attack. The extent of decomposition indicated that the victim had likely died between five and seven weeks prior to her discovery.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=21}} Furthermore, the murderer had dragged his victim uphill to the location where he had buried her; this conclusion was further supported by the presence of three parallel scrapes upon the skin of the right ankle, which corresponded with tears in the right sock.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|pages=1926|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nThe body was removed and taken to [[Guy's Hospital]], to await a formal [[autopsy]].{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=17}}\n\n===Autopsy===\nOn the evening of 8 October, Dr. Simpson conducted an autopsy upon the victim, ascertaining that the body was that of a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] female, approximately 20 years old and 5 feet, 4 inches in height. Her cropped hair was naturally sandy brown in colour, but had been bleached blonde several weeks before her death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1925|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nHaving carefully reconstructed the skull by wiring together all 38<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 287\">''On Trial for Murder'' p. 287</ref> fragments that could be found, Simpson clearly revealed a large impact site at the rear of the skull measuring five inches in length and one-and-three-quarter inches in breadth, further affirming his earlier conclusions at the crime scene. This injury, coupled with a fracture to the victim's right cheek bone, led Simpson to conclude that the victim had died as a result of a single, heavy blow to back of the head, inflicted while the victim was lying face down. The weapon which had delivered this fatal injury was a pole or bough of wood, and the blow from this weapon had caved in the skull. The commensurate positioning of the fracture to the cheek bone further supported the conclusion the victim had been killed as she lay face down on the ground.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=23}} These injuries would have induced rapid [[unconsciousness]], and death would have resulted within minutes.\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"I thought it had begun in the [[dell (landform)|dell]] where Joan's papers were found, probably with the stabbing attack on her head ...

The positioning of the knife wounds on the skull indicated the victim had been facing her attacker throughout this initial assault; this was further supported by the wounds in the right forearm, which suggested the victim had raised her hands to protect herself from these knife blows (no flesh remained on the left hand or forearm to identify potential similar wounds).<ref>''Bodies of Evidence'' p. 42</ref> The head wounds had been inflicted on the left section of the skull and forehead, consistent with the attacker being a right-handed individual.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|pages=1926\u20131928|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref> Curiously, the tissues around the stab wounds in the victim's forearm and hand had been pulled outwards as the knife had been extracted\u2014indicating the end of the blade had a curved or hooked point,<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1926|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref> resembling a parrot's beak. Three of the wounds located on the top of the reconstructed skull were particularly distinctive, being circular [[Countersink|countersunk]] holes, further supporting this conclusion.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=21-23}}\n\nIn addition to these knife and blunt trauma injuries, the victim's jaw had also been broken and three teeth dislodged, although it was impossible to determine whether these injuries had been sustained through a fall or her being struck in the face. Furthermore, Simpson concluded all these injuries had been inflicted while the victim was alive and most probably conscious. In his view, Dr. Simpson concluded that, in view of the trauma sustained, the victim had received several stab wounds to the head as she faced her attacker, and that she had attempted to ward off these blows with her hands and arms before attempting to run from her assailant; she had then either stumbled to the ground or fainted, likely dislodging three of her teeth in the fall, before her murderer had inflicted the fatal blow to her skull, with this blow also shattering her cheek bone.<ref>''War Crimes: Underworld Britain in the Second World War'' p. 90</ref>\n\nThe extent of [[saponification]] of body fats in the remaining breast and thigh tissue of the victim, in conjunction with the continuous presence of heat generated by maggot infestation, led Dr. Simpson to revise the length of time the victim had lain undiscovered to one month, meaning the victim had died in early- to mid-September. Moreover, the extensive infestation of maggots indicated she had lain exposed to [[weather|the elements]] for a minimum of 24 hours before her murderer had buried her body.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Search of Hankley Common===\nOn 12 October, a search team consisting of 60 police constables discovered a heavy, tapered bough of birchwood approximately 350 yards from the burial site.<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 287\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|pages=1926\u20131927|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref> This bough had been sharpened at both ends,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and was found just 16 yards from a military [[tripwire]]. Upon closer inspection, investigators noted several short strands of blonde human hair crushed into the [[Bark (botany)|bark]], strongly indicating Wolfe had fallen to the ground at this location before her murderer had used this bough to inflict the vast depressed fracture to her skull. (This theory would be supported by Dr. Simpson, who confirmed the dimensions of this bough perfectly matched the cavity within the victim's skull, and that the hair samples upon the instrument matched those retrieved from her scalp.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=25\u201329}})\n\nThree days later, within a 400-yard radius of the burial site, these officers also discovered numerous personal artifacts belonging to the victim including her shoes and purse, a handbag containing a [[rosary]], a bar of soap, and a distinctive elephant charm.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/> In a [[dell (landform)|dell]] above where the tripwire and bough had been discovered, officers discovered a crucifix, a [[National Registration Act 1939|National Registration Card]] issued to one Joan Pearl Wolfe, a blank document issued by the Canadian Army to men requesting permission to marry, and a letter written by Wolfe to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier named August Sangret, informing him of her pregnancy, and her hopes of his agreeing to marry her.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Also found were a further fragment of the victim's skull, and a tooth.\n\nThe personal possessions belonging to the victim were identified by Edith Watts as belonging to her daughter. Furthermore, Superintendent Richard Webb had earlier recognised Wolfe's name, having interviewed her in both July and August after she had been brought into custody due to concerns for her welfare, due to her living on the common in makeshift shelters. On both occasions, she had worn a distinctive green-and-white dress like that discovered upon the body, and at Webb's own instigation, Wolfe had been sent to hospital. Furthermore, Webb was able to recall her companion had been the Canadian soldier mentioned in the letter discovered close to her body.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=24}}\n\n==Interrogation==\nFollowing the identification of Wolfe's body, Chief Inspector Greeno and Superintendent Richard Webb informally interviewed Sangret at the Godalming army camp where he was stationed on 12 October.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> In this interview, Sangret freely admitted to having dated Wolfe, but insisted he had not seen her since 14 September, when she had failed to keep a date with him. He had not taken their relationship too seriously, being more interested in a woman he had earlier met in [[Glasgow]]. Furthermore, although he had not reported Wolfe as missing to police, he had reported her disappearance to his Provost Sergeant. When shown articles of Wolfe's clothing, Sangret formally identified these garments as belonging to her.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nUpon interviewing Sangret's army colleagues, Inspector Greeno learned of the alternating and conflicting explanations he had given to these men as to Wolfe's disappearance, and that his demeanour had alternated between bouts of unperturbedness and anxiety over the previous weeks. Moreover, one colleague remarked to Greeno that, upon learning of the discovery of Wolfe's body, Sangret had seemed \"on edge\".<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n===Statement===\nGreeno subsequently requested permission from the army to take Sangret to Godalming police station to conduct a formal interview. This request was granted, and Sangret was taken to this police station later that day.\n\nAt Godalming police station, Sangret was asked whether he would tell all he knew of Wolfe, and his association with her. In response, he casually replied, \"Yes, all right.\" The subsequent 17,000-word verbal statement Sangret delivered would prove to be the then-longest statement ever made in British criminal history;{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=86}} taking a policeman four days to compose in longhand in interview sessions totaling almost 19 hours. These interviews were conducted between 12 and 16 October (on 15 October, no interviews were conducted due to Inspector Greeno being occupied with other police matters). In addition to formally interviewing Sangret on these dates, Greeno had Sangret show investigators the various locations he mentioned in his statement, such as Kate Hayter's bungalow, and the locations of the two wigwams he had constructed.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=134}} Throughout the days in which he was questioned, Sangret remained at the police station.\n\nIn his statement, Sangret discussed in exhaustive detail his relationship with Wolfe, and his actions following her disappearance. He did concede to having had an argument with Wolfe regarding his reluctance to marry her on the final occasion he had seen her,<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 288\"/> but denied having either caused her any harm, or any knowledge of her current whereabouts.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> When questioned as to the whereabouts of his army-issue knife, Sangret claimed he had given this instrument to Wolfe.\n\nAfter completing his statement on the morning of 16 October,<ref>{{cite news|title=Soldier on Murder Charge: Evidence of Leaves in North |date=14 January 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19430114&id=jzRAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TVkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5737,740235&hl=en |accessdate=4 February 2019|work=The Glasgow Herald}}</ref> Sangret was released, pending further inquiries.

His army blanket and uniform had been confiscated at Godalming police station, and sent to a Dr. Roche Lynch at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] to undergo [[Benzidine|Benzidine testing]]. Dr. Lynch was able to conclude that both the trousers and blanket had recently been washed in a basic and clumsy manner, and that each garment bore evidence of bloodstains.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Furthermore, Lynch was able to deduce that the positioning of the bloodstains within the army blanket was consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe's head and arm wounds, had she been wrapped in this garment.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1929|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 1942, a distinctive knife with a hooked point resembling a parrot's beak was discovered by a Private Albert Brown, hidden in a waste pipe within the wash-house at Witley barracks.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Brown had discovered this instrument when tasked with clearing a blocked drain; he and a colleague immediately handed this knife to Harold Wade, who in turn forwarded the weapon to the Surrey Police.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> (Subsequent [[witness|eyewitness]] testimony would indicate Sangret had excused himself to wash his hands in this wash-room on 12 October, immediately prior to his initial, informal questioning by Inspector Greeno. He had been alone in the wash-room for between three and four minutes, although the water had been cut off at the time.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=158}})\n\nThe knife itself was not of Canadian issue, but [[British Army]] (although subsequent trial testimony would confirm such a model of knife had been issued to the Canadian Army until 1939{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=102}}). A Canadian soldier named Samuel Crowle had found this knife embedded in a tree close to one of the wigwams Sangret had earlier constructed in mid-August; he had intended to keep the knife due to its unique blade, but had been advised by a colleague to deliver it to a Corporal Thomas Harding, who had in turn handed the knife to Sangret on 26 August, suspecting the knife had belonged to him, given that Crowle had informed him he had found the knife near a wigwam \"with some people talking inside\".<ref name=\"Tragic End of Joan the Wigwam Girl\"/>\n\nDr. Lynch subjected the knife to similar testing to which he had previously subjected Sangret's army blanket and uniform, although this knife\u2014having been immersed in a drainage system for over six weeks\u2014bore no evidence of bloodstains, hair samples or [[fingerprint]]s. Nonetheless, Doctors Eric Gardner and Keith Simpson each independently examined the weapon on 3 December and concluded only such a knife could have inflicted the wounds discovered on Wolfe's skull and arm.<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 288\">''On Trial for Murder'' p. 288</ref>\n\nOn 6 December, Inspector Greeno interviewed Sangret at the Aldershot barracks where he had recently been transferred, before requesting he accompany investigators to Hankley Common to pinpoint the locations he and Wolfe had lived and frequented. Sangret agreed to this request, although he resolutely refused to enter or even glance in the direction of Houndown Wood.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=92}} Upon returning to Godalming police station, Sangret agreed to submit to a second formal interview, in which Greeno focused largely upon issues regarding the knives he and Wolfe had owned. In this statement, Sangret stated Wolfe had been in possession of a black-handled knife with a hooked point, which she had been given by Francis Hearn. Shortly after 4 p.m. that afternoon, Sangret was formally charged with the murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe. He was held on [[remand (detention)|remand]] at [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]], to await [[committal procedure|committal hearing]]s.{{sfn|Quigley|2006|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n===Committal hearings===\nFormal committal hearings were held in Guildford between 12 and 20 January 1943, and saw 21 members of the Canadian Army testify as eyewitnesses to Sangret's relationship with Wolfe; his conflicting and indifferent accounts as to her whereabouts following her disappearance; his being in possession of the knife alleged to have been used in her murder; and his movements on critical dates. In addition, Doctors Simpson, Gardner and Lynch each testified as to their collective forensic findings upon Wolfe's body and Sangret's clothing and army blanket. Also to testify at these committal hearings was Inspector Greeno, who read in full Sangret's voluminous statements to the court before testifying as to Sangret's admission prior to his initial release from custody that he had deduced these official matters were in motion due to her body being found.<ref name=\"The Evening Citizen\"/>\n\nOn 20 January, [[Malcolm Macnaghten|Mr Justice Macnaghten]] declared enough evidence had been presented to warrant Sangret being brought to trial, and set a date of 24 February for the trial to commence at the [[Surrey County Hall]].<ref name=\"The Evening Citizen\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nThe trial of August Sangret for the murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe began at the [[Surrey County Hall]] on 24 February 1943. He was tried before Mr Justice Macnaghten and a jury. The [[Clerk of Assize|clerk of assize]] opened proceedings on this date by asking Sangret to stand to hear a formal recitation of the charge, and to state his [[plea]]. Sangret formally stated his plea of [[plea|not guilty]] to the charge against him; the Clerk then informed the jury: \"It is for you to say whether he is guilty or not guilty, and to hearken to the evidence.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=95}}\n\nIn his [[opening statement]] on behalf of [[the Crown]], Eric Neve outlined the prosecution's intention to prove beyond a [[reasonable doubt]] that Sangret had murdered Wolfe\u2014whom he referred to as ''the Wigwam Girl''\u2014on or about 14 September 1942.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soldier For Trial on Murder Charge |date=23 January 1943 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/49536250 |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=The Barrier Miner}}</ref> Neve then defined for the jury the very definition of the crime of murder, before outlining the relationship between the decedent and the accused; quoting from letters exchanged between the two and harking to the two wigwams Sangret had constructed on Hankley Common and in which he had lived with the decedent in the weeks prior to her murder.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wigwam Girl's Slayer on Trial |date=24 February 1943 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19430224&id=7QUoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8iIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5901,1909391&hl=en |accessdate=4 February 2019|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal}}</ref> Neve further outlined the prosecution's [[main contention|contention]] that Sangret had constructed these wigwams with the same distinctive knife he had subsequently used in her murder, before displaying [[Exhibit (legal)|Exhibit]]s 3 and 4: the birch bough used to inflict the substantial fracture to the rear of her skull, and the distinctive black-handled knife with a hooked point, which he had attempted to conceal at Witley barracks.\n\nNeve further outlined that Sangret had told several conflicting stories of Wolfe's whereabouts in the weeks she had been missing, and that forensic experts would testify that only a distinctive knife such as Exhibit 4 could have inflicted the wounds discovered on Wolfe's forehead. Furthermore, Neve stated that bloodstains had been discovered on Sangret's trousers and army blanket, and that Dr. Roche Lynch would testify as to the positioning of the bloodstains found upon the army blanket being consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe's head and arm wounds, indicating Sangret had initially wrapped her body in this garment.\n\nSangret's lawyer, Linton Thorp, rejected the prosecution's contention that the knife alleged to have been the murder weapon had belonged to Sangret in his opening speech for the defence; emphasising his client's insistence that he had never owned such a knife and adding that the knife in question was of British Army issue as opposed to Canadian. Furthermore, Thorp added that a knife found some 23 paces from the murder scene had been discarded by a policeman who had initially attached no importance to the find, and that repeated searches to relocate this knife had been unsuccessful.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/>\n\nThorp further elaborated on Sangret's insistence he had loved Wolfe; informing the jurors that several letters written by Wolfe had been found in his possession at the time of his arrest and that, following her disappearance, Sangret had made efforts to locate her. Moreover, Thorp emphasised that Wolfe's history of liaising with soldiers in the two years prior to her murder, coupled with her solitary and nomadic lifestyle, meant any number of the 100,000 soldiers stationed in the vicinity of Witley and Thursley could have been her actual murderer.\n\n===Witness testimony===\nFormal witness testimony began on the first day of the trial, with 17 prosecution witnesses called to testify on this date, including the [[Superintendent (police)|Detective Superintendent]] of the Surrey Constabulary, who formally introduced into evidence the birch bough murder weapon found on Hankley Common the previous October, and the knife forwarded to Surrey Police by Provost Sergeant Harold Wade.<ref name=\"On Trial for Murder p. 288\"/> Also to testify was Wolfe's mother, Edith Watts, who formally identified her daughter's crucifix, purse, and elephant charm which had all been found in and around the dell where her daughter had been attacked, and Sergeant Charles Hicks, who testified as to his regularly reading Wolfe's letters to Sangret, then composing his replies. Hicks further testified that Sangret had only informed him of Wolfe's disappearance on 27 September.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=97}}\n\nThe second day of the trial saw a further 20 prosecution witnesses called to testify, most of whom were military personnel [[subpoena|summons]]ed to testify as to Sangret's conduct with Wolfe prior to her murder, his evident reluctance to commit to the marriage Wolfe had evidently yearned for,<ref>{{cite news|title=Killed Girl to Escape Marriage, N.C.O.

One of these witnesses was Provost Sergeant Harold Wade, who testified that Sangret had only informed him of Wolfe's disappearance on 21 September, and that Sangret had informed him of the final conversation he had had with Wolfe prior to her disappearance on this date. According to Wade, when Wolfe\u2014weeping openly\u2014had asked Sangret whether he \"care[d] to marry [her] or not\", Sangret had responded, \"No, I don't\". Upon hearing this, Wade testified he had advised Sangret to simply forget her, to which Sangret had replied the reason for his visit was that, had anything happened to Wolfe, he did not wish to be involved in the matter.\n\nAlso called to testify on this date was Private Samuel Crowle, who had found the knife introduced as Exhibit 4 close to the second wigwam Sangret had constructed on Hankley Common the previous August. Crowle formally identified the knife as being that which he had discovered on the common and had briefly retained before handing to his superior due to its distinctive blade and a \"little nick\" he had noted the knife bore.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=154}} In addition to Crowle's testimony, an American soldier named Raymond Deadman also testified on 25 February as to his becoming acquainted with Wolfe in the week prior to her murder, and to his observing Sangret's [[ownership|possessive]] nature. In response to questioning by Eric Neve, Deadman explained he had become acquainted with Wolfe on 4 September, and that she had introduced him to Sangret on this date. The following day, he had walked across the common in her company, before they had encountered Sangret, who, Deadman testified, had become angry at seeing her in his company. According to Deadman, Sangret then chided a visibly nervous Wolfe for leaving \"the shack\" without his permission.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=100}}\n\nOne of the final witnesses to testify on the second day of the trial was Private Joseph Arsenault, who had been stationed at Witley Camp between July and October 1942, and had become acquainted with Sangret. Arsenault testified as to his observing Sangret, alone, cleaning his trousers in the camp wash-room in an effort to remove dark stains he (Arsenault) had seen on the garment. In response to [[cross-examination]] by Linton Thorp, Arsenault conceded he could not pinpoint the precise date he had seen Sangret washing his trousers in the wash-room, and that the date in question could have been anytime he had been stationed at Witley Camp.\n\nThe knife the prosecution contended had inflicted the distinctive injuries to Wolfe's forehead was introduced in evidence as Exhibit 4, with Corporal Thomas Harding testifying as to his handing this weapon to Sangret on 26 August. In response to questioning by his defence, Sangret denied he had ever seen the knife introduced into evidence, and claimed he had never being given such a weapon by Corporal Harding.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=91}} Furthermore, Sangret described the knife he had used to construct both wigwams as belonging to Wolfe. This weapon, he claimed, had both a [[marlin spike]] and a can opener, and he had been informed by Wolfe that the knife had been given to her by Francis Hearn. In addition, Sangret insisted he had never taken his own army-issue knife off barracks.\n\nTwo of the prosecution's main witnesses were Drs Keith Simpson and Eric Gardner, who testified on the second and third days of the trial respectively. Both pathologists testified as to the recovery of Wolfe's body\u2014which they noted had been \"covered, rather than buried\"\u2014and their subsequent examination of her remains, both [[in situ]] on the common, and\u2014with regards to Dr. Simpson\u2014at Guy's Hospital. With the aid of enlarged photographs of the wounds discovered upon Wolfe's skull, Dr. Simpson testified that only a knife such as that with the \"peculiarities\" of the one discovered hidden in the waste pipe at Witley barracks could have inflicted the distinctive circular wounds discovered upon Wolfe's skull. In relation to the partially extracted muscle tissue and [[ligament]]s discovered in the victim's right forearm and hand, Simpson confirmed such trauma could only have occurred through a distinctive, hooked blade retaining the tissue upon extraction.\n\nAgainst [[Objection (law)|overruled]] objections from Linton Thorp, Dr. Simpson then retrieved Wolfe's skull from a cardboard box to demonstrate for the jury just how this knife fitted the wounds discovered in Wolfe's skull, and how the channel tracts to the right of each wound again matched the dimensions of Exhibit 4. Simpson also explained to the jury how the positioning of these wounds indicated she had likely been facing her right-handed attacker when these wounds were delivered.{{sfn|Trow|1994|pp=104\u2013105}} Although both Simpson and Gardner conceded the knife introduced as Exhibit 4 may not have been the actual murder weapon as opposed to another, precise replica issue, both pathologists dismissed the possibility that any standard-issue American or Canadian Army knife presented before them could have created these distinctive, countersink wounds. (No other soldier stationed at Witley Camp had been in possession of such a weapon.)\n\nFollowing the testimony of Dr. Gardner, Dr. Roche Lynch took the witness stand to discuss the results of the Benzidine tests he had conducted upon Sangret's army blanket, uniform, water-bottle, and the knife discovered at Witley barracks. Lynch testified that both the uniform and blanket had recently been washed, albeit clumsily. Nonetheless, through conducting Benzidine tests upon each garment, he had concluded each bore evidence of bloodstains, whereas no blood had been discovered on the knife or water-bottle.\n\nIn cross-examination of Dr. Lynch, Linton Thorp did succeed in getting Lynch to concede the washing of the garments in question prior to their examination meant he (Lynch) could not definitively state these stains had originated from human blood.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=107}} Thorp then attempted to suggest these stains, if sourcing from human blood, may have been caused through human scratching through [[louse|lice]] infestation; Dr. Lynch countered this assertion by stating it would be physically impossible to produce such extensive staining through scratching.\n\n===Defence testimony===\nOn 26 February, Linton Thorp called Sangret to testify on his own behalf (this testimony would last until 1 March). In response to questioning from his counsel, Sangret chronologically discussed his two-month courtship with Wolfe, the improvised homes he had built for her, and their marriage plans. In a direct contradiction to the earlier testimony of several of his colleagues and Provost Sergeant Harold Wade (whom he contended were simply lying{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=176}}), Sangret claimed he had fully intended to marry Wolfe, and denied either arguing with her on the final occasion he had seen her on 13 September, or ever refusing to marry her.<ref>{{cite news|title=Knife Was Not His: Soldier's Denial in Murder Charge |date=2 March 1943 |url=https://www1.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1943-03-01/1943-03-07?basicsearch=august%20sangret&exactsearch=false&county=gloucestershire%2c%20england&country=england&retrievecountrycounts=false&mostspecificlocation=gloucestershire%2c%20england |accessdate=31 January 2019|publisher=Gloucester Citizen}}</ref> In relation to the knife Corporal Thomas Harding had given to him on 26 August, Sangret emphatically denied he had been given the knife the prosecution contended he had used in her murder on this date, and insisted he had been given a distinctly different, Canadian-issue knife introduced into evidence as Exhibit 34.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=156}}\n\nUpon completion of defence counsel questioning, Sangret was subjected to an intense cross-examination by Eric Neve, who repeatedly raised the inconsistencies, contradictions and \"convenience\" in Sangret's claims\u2014both in his trial testimony and the two statements he had given to Inspector Greeno\u2014as opposed to the witness testimony and forensic evidence presented. These questions related to such issues as Sangret's accounts of his whereabouts both before and after Wolfe's disappearance; his evident infidelity in light of his claims of his intentions to marry her; his claims he had never argued with Wolfe; his denial of ever being in possession of the knife introduced into evidence; and the numerous, differing, earlier explanations he had given to his colleagues and his Provost Sergeant as to Wolfe's disappearance.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=109}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nThe trial of August Sangret lasted nine days, and saw 52 witnesses testify on behalf of the prosecution, with only Sangret himself testifying in his own defence. Following the conclusion of Neve's cross-examination of Sangret on 2 March, both prosecution and defence attorneys delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Eric Neve outlined the testimony presented by forensic experts, investigators and Sangret's fellow servicemen on behalf of the prosecution; all of which Neve asserted, when combined, sufficiently proved Sangret had slain \"this unfortunate girl\" before vainly attempting to establish an alibi and conceal the murder weapon.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/>\n\nFollowing the prosecution's closing argument, Linton Thorp argued on behalf of the defence. In his closing argument, Thorp reiterated his client's love for Wolfe, and stated that all evidence and testimony presented by the prosecution was [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]]. Thorp further emphasised to the jury that no conclusive proof existed that Sangret had murdered Wolfe.<ref name=\"St. Petersburg Times\"/>\n\nUpon completion of both counsels' closing arguments, Macnaghten delivered his final instructions to the jury: \"That the girl was murdered is not in dispute; that she was murdered by some man is also quite plain. The only question you have to determine is: Have the Crown satisfied you beyond all real doubt that the prisoner, August Sangret, is the man who murdered her? I can only conclude by saying what I said at the beginning: when dealing with a case of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied beyond all doubt before you find the prisoner is guilty.\"<ref>''War Crimes'' p. 171</ref>\n\nFollowing this final instruction from Macnaghten, the jury retired to consider their verdict, taking Wolfe's skull and the knife alleged by the prosecution to have inflicted the preliminary stab wounds to her body to assist in their deliberations.<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder on Hankley Common|journal=Real-Life Crimes|date=1995|issue=88|page=1931|isbn=978-1-85875-022-4}}</ref>\n\n==Conviction==\nThe jury deliberated for two hours before announcing they had reached their verdict: Sangret was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of Wolfe's murder, although this verdict was accompanied with a strong recommendation as to mercy.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Passing sentence, Mr Justice Macnaghten donned his formal [[black cap]] and made the following speech:\n\n{{cquote|August Sangret, the jury have found that it was you who murdered Joan Wolfe, and none who heard the evidence can doubt the justice of the verdict. They have accompanied it with a strong recommendation for mercy; that will be forwarded to the proper quarter. It only remains for me to pronounce the sentence prescribed by law.\n\nThe sentence of the court is that you be taken from here to the place from whence you came, and from there to a place of lawful execution, and that there you be hanged by the neck until you be dead; and that your body afterwards be buried within the precincts of the prison in which you shall have been last confined. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=111}}}}\n\nBefore Macnaghten passed this death sentence, Sangret was asked by the clerk of assize whether he wished to address the court. In response, Sangret declared: \"I am not guilty, sir. I never killed that girl.\"<ref>''Sentence of Death For Murder of Girl.'' [[The Times]] 3 March 1943 p8 column D</ref>\n\n===Appeal===\nFollowing his conviction, August Sangret uncustomarily filed a [[appeal|notice of appeal]] against his sentence on his own behalf, without first consulting his defence counsel.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=140}} His appeal was heard on 13 April before three judges in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]: the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] (the [[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Viscount Caldecote]]), [[Travers Humphreys|Mr Justice Humphreys]], and [[Wilfrid Lewis|Mr Justice Lewis]]. As was customary, both original counsels were present at this hearing, although as Sangret's appeal had been filed without his first consulting with his defence counsel, neither Linton Thorp or his co-counsel, Laurence Vine, were able to challenge either the trial conduct or the verdict beyond the contents of Sangret's personal appeal (in which he had simply stated his disagreement with the guilty verdict, proclaimed his innocence, and claimed that he had not owned the knife identified as being used in Wolfe's murder). Nonetheless, Thorp did emphasise the jury's strong recommendation to mercy.\n\nThe same day they had convened to hear Sangret's appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction, ruling there had been no evidence presented to attest to either trial misconduct or Sangret's innocence, adding they had further chosen to summarily dismiss the appeal due to \"the abundance of evidence the appellant was the murderer of the girl\", further stating there had been \"no possible ground on which the verdict could be disturbed\".<ref>''Court of Criminal Appeal, Murder of a Girl: Appeal Dismissed.'' [[The Times]] 13 Apr 1943 p.2, col.

Like others in authority before him, Webb had noted her as being \"in need of protection\" and, on the occasion he had seen her, had observed her as being \"somewhat dirty\". Webb testified to having repeatedly spoken with Wolfe in great detail; noting her soft-spoken and quiet manner. In defence of her character, Webb conceded that, although her lifestyle was somewhat immoral, she had been fiercely loyal to any one soldier at a time, in the hope he would marry her and provide her with the eventual security and stability she desired.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=80}}\n* In his [[memoirs]], published in 1960, Inspector Edward Greeno confided his conducting the formal interview with Sangret at Godalming police station on 12 October had subsequently proven illegal, as Sangret had been held without charge for five days\u2014four days longer than the law of [[habeas corpus]] allowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/uk.php#f1|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: United Kingdom|date=1 January 2012|via=loc.gov}}</ref> Greeno confided he had been extremely concerned this issue may have been raised in court, adding that, prior to trial, he had been contacted by then-[[Assistant Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Assistant Commissioner]] [[Norman Kendal|Sir Norman Kendal]] on this very issue. However, for reasons unknown, neither Linton Thorp or his co-counsel, Laurence Vine, chose to raise this issue at Sangret's trial or subsequent appeal.{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=108}}\n* Despite his conceding the case against Sangret may have been \"flung out [of court] then and there\" had Sangret's defence raised the issue of his breaching the law of habeas corpus, Greeno nonetheless reiterated his conviction of Sangret's guilt in what he recollected as being \"nearly the [[perfect crime]]: a murder not only unsolved, but undiscovered.\"{{sfn|Trow|1994|p=145}} Greeno did, however, theorise as to Sangret's motive:<blockquote>I had interviewed thousands of people in this case, and seventy-four of them went into the witness-box. The case was so watertight that, as Sir Norman Kendal said later, Sangret's appeal against the death sentence was almost a [[farce]]. One small doubt remained: Sangret murdered the girl because she was expecting his child\u2014but was she? Was she expecting anybody's child? The doctors didn't think so on the occasion that the police sent her to hospital, and when her body was found, it was too late to tell. But this is certain: Sangret did murder her. He confessed before he died ... It is never announced when a murderer confesses. But why not? There are always [[crank (person)|cranks]] and [[Pseudoscience|crackpots]] to argue that some wicked policeman has framed some poor fellow. So why make an official secret of the fact that the policeman did his job?{{sfn|Greeno|1960|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n==Media==\n* The case of ''the Wigwam Murder'' has twice been dramatised by British radio [[scriptwriter]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Harry Alan Towers]].

The group was formed in 2009, when nearly all the members of the [[Great Bash Heel]] (G.B.H) stable turned on leader [[Togi Makabe]] and reformed under new leader [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]. Soon after, the new group was named Chaos, with Nakamura as the leader. As the leader of Chaos, Nakamura was one of NJPW's top wrestlers, winning the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] as well as the [[G1 Climax#2011|2011]] [[G1 Climax]] and the [[New Japan Cup#2014|2014]] [[New Japan Cup]].\n\nSince its founding, Chaos has added several new members, including [[Kazuchika Okada]], who has held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] five times and won the [[G1 Climax]] tournament in [[G1 Climax#2012|2012]] and [[G1 Climax#2014|2014]], as well as the [[New Japan Cup#2013|2013]] and [[New Japan Cup#2019|2019]] [[New Japan Cup]]. Okada became the leader of Chaos after Nakamura's departure from New Japan and succeeded [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] as the promotion's \"ace,\" or top star. [[Rocky Romero]], another member of Chaos, won the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] a record eight times.\n\nChaos originally was the only [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] group in New Japan. In 2013, Chaos started feuds with two other villainous groups, [[Suzuki-gun]] and [[Bullet Club]], which led to the stable being portrayed in a more sympathetic way.

terms#Stable|stable]], primarily performing in the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. The group was formed in 2009, when nearly all the members of the [[Great Bash Heel]] (G.B.H) stable turned on leader [[Togi Makabe]] and reformed under new leader [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]. Soon after, the new group was named Chaos, with Nakamura as the leader. As the leader of Chaos, Nakamura was one of NJPW's top wrestlers, winning the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] as well as the [[G1 Climax#2011|2011]] [[G1 Climax]] and the [[New Japan Cup#2014|2014]] [[New Japan Cup]].\n\nSince its founding, Chaos has added several new members, including [[Kazuchika Okada]], who has held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] five times and won the [[G1 Climax]] tournament in [[G1 Climax#2012|2012]] and [[G1 Climax#2014|2014]], as well as the [[New Japan Cup#2013|2013]] and [[New Japan Cup#2019|2019]] [[New Japan Cup]]. Okada became the leader of Chaos after Nakamura's departure from New Japan and succeeded [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] as the promotion's \"ace,\" or top star. [[Rocky Romero]], another member of Chaos, won the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] a record eight times.\n\nChaos originally was the only [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] group in New Japan.
