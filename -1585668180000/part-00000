In the original name in all native languages, there is no mention of the city of Temeschwar ([[Timi\u0219oara]]) in the title of Voivodeship. As shown above, the reference to the Temes region is always used, and should be translated into English as ''Temes Banat'' or ''Banat of Temes''.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Vojvodina}}\nThe [[Voivodeship]] was formed by a decision of the Austrian emperor in November 1849, after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Revolutions of 1848/1849]]. It was formed in accordance with privilege given to [[Serbs]] by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] [[emperor]] in 1691, recognizing the right of Serbs to territorial autonomy within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.\n\nIt consisted of the regions of [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]] and northern [[Syrmia]]n municipalities of [[Ilok]] and [[Ruma]]. An Austrian governor seated in [[Timi\u0219oara|Temeschwar]] ruled the area, and the title of [[Voivode]] belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was \"[[Grosswojwod|Grand Voivod]] of the Voivodeship of Serbia\" (German: ''Gro\u00dfwoiwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien''). Even after the Voivodeship was abolished, the emperor kept this title until the end of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] in 1918.\n\n[[Image:Vojvodschaft serbien 1853.jpg|thumb|280px|Map from 1853]]\nIn 1860, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat was abolished and most of its territory (Banat and Ba\u010dka) was incorporated into the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Hungary]], although direct Hungarian rule began only in 1867, after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]]. Unlike Banat and Ba\u010dka, in 1860 Syrmia was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]], another separate Habsburg crown land. Kingdom of Slavonia subsequently joined with the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] forming new kingdom named [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], which made a pact with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1868, hence becoming self-governed part of the Kingdom of Hungary within [[Austria-Hungary]].\n\n==Languages==\nThe two official languages of the Voivodeship were German and \"Illyrian\" (what would come to be known as [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{History of Vojvodina}}\nThe Voivodeship was ethnically very mixed, since the southern parts of Syrmia, Banat and Ba\u010dka with compact Serbian settlements were not included in it, while eastern Banat, with a Romanian majority was added to it.\n\n===1846===\nAccording to the 1846 census, the territory that in 1849 formed the voivodeship included:<ref name=\"Lazo M.

In the original name in all native languages, there is no mention of the city of Temeschwar ([[Timi\u0219oara]]) in the title of Voivodeship. As shown above, the reference to the Temes region is always used, and should be translated into English as ''Temes Banat'' or ''Banat of Temes''.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of Vojvodina}}\nThe [[Voivodeship]] was formed by a decision of the Austrian emperor in November 1849, after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Revolutions of 1848/1849]]. It was formed in accordance with privilege given to [[Serbs]] by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] [[emperor]] in 1691, recognizing the right of Serbs to territorial autonomy within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.\n\nIt consisted of the regions of [[Banat]], [[Ba\u010dka]] and northern [[Syrmia]]n municipalities of [[Ilok]] and [[Ruma]]. An Austrian governor seated in [[Timi\u015foara|Temeschwar]] ruled the area, and the title of [[Voivode]] belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was \"[[Grosswojwod|Grand Voivod]] of the Voivodeship of Serbia\" (German: ''Gro\u00dfwoiwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien''). Even after the Voivodeship was abolished, the emperor kept this title until the end of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] in 1918.\n\n[[Image:Vojvodschaft serbien 1853.jpg|thumb|280px|Map from 1853]]\nIn 1860, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat was abolished and most of its territory (Banat and Ba\u010dka) was incorporated into the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Hungary]], although direct Hungarian rule began only in 1867, after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]]. Unlike Banat and Ba\u010dka, in 1860 Syrmia was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]], another separate Habsburg crown land. Kingdom of Slavonia subsequently joined with the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] forming new kingdom named [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], which made a pact with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1868, hence becoming self-governed part of the Kingdom of Hungary within [[Austria-Hungary]].\n\n==Languages==\nThe two official languages of the Voivodeship were German and \"Illyrian\" (what would come to be known as [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{History of Vojvodina}}\nThe Voivodeship was ethnically very mixed, since the southern parts of Syrmia, Banat and Ba\u010dka with compact Serbian settlements were not included in it, while eastern Banat, with a Romanian majority was added to it.\n\n===1846===\nAccording to the 1846 census, the territory that in 1849 formed the voivodeship included:<ref name=\"Lazo M.

The company owns several non-fiction and entertainment-based television brands, including its namesake [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]], [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]], [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]], [[FYI (U.S. TV network)|FYI]], and their associated sister channels, and holds stakes in or licenses their international branches.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Arts and Entertainment ===\n[[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] was formed from the merger of the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] and the Entertainment Channel, a premium cable channel, in 1984 with their respective owners keeping stakes in the new company. Thus A&E's shareholders were [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (from ARTS) and [[Radio City Music Hall]] ([[Rockefeller Group]]) and [[RCA]], then the parent of [[NBC]] (from Entertainment Channel). The company launched [[A&E (TV channel)|Arts & Entertainment Network]], a cultural cable channel, on February 1, 1984.<ref name=idc>{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 32 |date=2000 |publisher=St. James Press |via=Funding Universe.com |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-e-television-networks-history/ |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |chapter=A & E Television Networks History}}</ref><ref name=vty1>{{cite news |last1=Dempsey |first1=John |title=ABC, NBC & Hearst buy up rest of A&E |url=https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/abc-nbc-hearst-buy-up-rest-of-a-e-107845/# |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |work=Variety |date=June 16, 1993}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, after having aired episodes of its original 1960's version starting in 1987, A&E acquired rights to, and started producing new episodes of, the documentary series ''[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]]''\u2014 which became the channel's flagship program. The network also introduced its own companion magazine ''A&E Monthly''.<ref name=idc/>\n\nThe company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993; it purchased the Lou Reda Productions documentary library and long-term rights for the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive.<ref name=idc/> In June 1993, the Rockefeller Group's Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake in A&E to the other three partners (now including [[NBC]] in place of RCA after GE's purchase of the latter in 1986) with NBC owning 25% and the other two 37.5% each.<ref name=vty1/>  Also that month, a new production unit was set up.<ref name=idc/>\n\n=== A&E Networks ===\n[[File:A&E Networks.svg|200px|thumb|left|Original logo used from 2011 to 2017]]\nThe A&E channel expanded to Canada, and later Mexico from 1993 to 1994. ''Biography'' began airing 5 nights a week in 1994. Also in 1994, A&E, on its 10th anniversary, changed its name from Arts and Entertainment to A&E.<ref name=idc/>\n\nThe A&E company launched [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] on January 1, 1995, with its UK counterpart following on November 1 in partnership with [[Sky (company)|British Sky Broadcasting]]. A&E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to lack of international rights to A&E international co-productions. As expected, the History Channel led A&E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997) and in Canada (1997). By 1997, the company had started its AETN International division.<ref name=idc/>\n\nFormerly only direct sales, A&E Home Video initiated a six-month trial in which [[Barnes & Noble]] would sell the \"Biography\" line in stores, which became permanent in 1996. THC debuted in two other media in September 1996 with a radio program on [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio Networks]] and [[Border Books]] stocking THC videos.<ref name=idc/>\n\nThe 'Biography' franchise continued to expand with a website in July 1996, a children's version launched in fall 1996, an audio tape line in 1997, telefilm development, a [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]] published short biography line and debuted its magazine which replaced A&E Monthly. During the 1998\u20131999 season, ''Biography: American Justice'' and ''Biography Movies'' debuted.<ref name=idc/>\n\nHistory expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), ''History Channel Traveler'', and a planned quarterly magazine. While in October, History and [[MSG Network]] teamed up to produce several short-form sports history programs.<ref name=idc/>\n\nA+E spun out its two digital cable channels in November 1998 with [[The Biography Channel]] and [[H2 (TV channel)|History Channel International]] from A&E and the History Channel. A&E was spending $10 million per year to convert to the digital format and for digital distribution.<ref name=idc/>\n\n=== Post-Lifetime acquisition===\nIn August 2009, A&E Networks acquired [[Lifetime Entertainment Services]], which at the time was jointly owned by Disney and Hearst, each with 50% ownership. Following the deal, Disney and Hearst each held approximately 42% of the combined company, while [[NBC Universal]] retained approximately 16%. The deal included mechanisms by which NBCU could choose, or alternatively be forced to, exit the partnership over the subsequent 15 years.<ref name=vty>https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/a-e-acquires-lifetime-1118007820/</ref><ref>https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/ae-networks-lifetime-merger-completed-35353</ref> In May 2011, A&E Television Networks changed its brand name to A+E Networks.

The company owns several non-fiction and entertainment-based television brands, including its namesake [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]], [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]], [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]], [[FYI (U.S. TV network)|FYI]], and their associated sister channels, and holds stakes in or licenses their international branches.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Arts and Entertainment ===\n[[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] was formed from the merger of the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] and the Entertainment Channel, a premium cable channel, in 1984 with their respective owners keeping stakes in the new company. Thus A&E's shareholders were [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (from ARTS) and [[Radio City Music Hall]] ([[Rockefeller Group]]) and [[RCA]], then the parent of [[NBC]] (from Entertainment Channel). The company launched [[A&E (TV channel)|Arts & Entertainment Network]], a cultural cable channel, on February 1, 1984.<ref name=idc>{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 32 |date=2000 |publisher=St. James Press |via=Funding Universe.com |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-e-television-networks-history/ |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |chapter=A & E Television Networks History}}</ref><ref name=vty1>{{cite news |last1=Dempsey |first1=John |title=ABC, NBC & Hearst buy up rest of A&E |url=https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/abc-nbc-hearst-buy-up-rest-of-a-e-107845/# |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |work=Variety |date=June 16, 1993}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, after having aired episodes of its original 1960's version starting in 1987, A&E acquired rights to, and started producing new episodes of, the documentary series ''[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]]''\u2014 which became the channel's flagship program. The network also introduced its own companion magazine ''A&E Monthly''.<ref name=idc/>\n\nThe company indicated that plans for a history channel were in the works in 1993; it purchased the Lou Reda Productions documentary library and long-term rights for the Hearst Entertainment documentaries archive.<ref name=idc/> In June 1993, the Rockefeller Group's Radio City Music Hall sold its 12.5% stake in A&E to the other three partners (now including [[NBC]] in place of RCA after GE's purchase of the latter in 1986) with NBC owning 25% and the other two 37.5% each.<ref name=vty1/>  Also that month, a new production unit was set up.<ref name=idc/>\n\n=== A&E Networks ===\n[[File:A&E Networks.svg|200px|thumb|left|Original logo used from 2011 to 2017]]\nThe A&E channel expanded to Canada, and later Mexico from 1993 to 1994.

A&E Networks considered History to be the driver in international expansion due to lack of international rights to A&E international co-productions. As expected, the History Channel led A&E's overseas expansion in Brazil with TVA (April 1996), the Nordic and Baltic regions with Modern Times Group (1997) and in Canada (1997). By 1997, the company had started its AETN International division.<ref name=idc/>\n\nFormerly only direct sales, A&E Home Video initiated a six-month trial in which [[Barnes & Noble]] would sell the \"Biography\" line in stores, which became permanent in 1996.

During the 1998\u20131999 season, ''Biography: American Justice'' and ''Biography Movies'' debuted.<ref name=idc/>\n\nHistory expanded in 1998 into tours of U.S. landmarks with Mayflower Tours having an affiliated website (historytravel.com), ''History Channel Traveler'', and a planned quarterly magazine. While in October, History and [[MSG Network]] teamed up to produce several short-form sports history programs.<ref name=idc/>\n\nA+E spun out its two digital cable channels in November 1998 with [[The Biography Channel]] and [[H2 (TV channel)|History Channel International]] from A&E and the History Channel.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

Nevertheless, he argued that the WHO, \"in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and their scientists, re-defined pandemics,\" removing the statement that \"an enormous amount of people have contracted the illness or died\" from its existing definition and replacing it by stating simply that there has to be a virus, spreading beyond borders and to which people have no immunity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/swine-flu/story-e6frfkyi-1225818388508|title=Swine flu 'a false pandemic' to sell vaccines, expert says|date=13 January 2010|publisher=[[News.com]]|accessdate=13 January 2010 | first=Chris | last=Pollard| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100114013335/http://www.news.com.au/world/swine-flu/story-e6frfkyi-1225818388508| archivedate= 14 January 2010 | url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nThe WHO responded by stating that they take their duty to provide independent advice seriously and guarded against interference from outside interests.

The 36,000 estimate was presented in a 2003 study by CDC scientists and refers to a period from 1990\u201391 through 1998\u201399. During those years, the number of estimated deaths ranged from 17,000 to 52,000, with an average of about 36,000. Throughout that decade, influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus during most of the seasons, and H3N2 influenza viruses are typically associated with higher death rates. The ''JAMA'' study also looked at seasonal influenza-associated deaths over a 23-year period, from 1976\u201377 and 1998\u201399 with estimates of respiratory and circulatory influenza-associated deaths ranging from about 5,000 to about 52,000, and an average of about 25,000.

In many cases, hospitals were relatively successful in making sure that those patients most severely affected by the influenza strain were able to be seen, treated, and discharged in an efficient manner. A case-study of the preparation, planning, mitigation, and response efforts during the fall of 2009 is that of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)which took several steps to increase the emergency department(ED) surge capacity response. CHOP used portions of the main lobby area as an ED waiting room; several of the region's hospital-based outpatient facilities were in use during evening and weekend hours for non-emergency cases; the ED's 24-hour short-stay unit was utilized to care for ED patients in a longer-term capacity; non-board certified physicians (in pediatric emergency medicine) and inpatient-unit medical nurses were utilized for ED patient care; hospital units normally utilized for other medical or therapeutic purposes were transformed into ED patient rooms; and rooms normally used for only one patient were expanded to at least a capacity of 2.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scarfone|first= Richard J.|author2=Susan Coffin |author3=Evan S.

In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archivedate= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.\n\nIn 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%.

The study concluded that had the vaccination program started 2 weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion.

A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by some [[Aboriginal Australian]] peoples for hunting.\n\nBoomerangs have been historically used for [[Hunting in Australia|hunting]], as well as sport and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Boomerang: Behind an Australian Icon|last = Jones|first = Philip|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9781862543829|location = |pages = }}</ref> and come in various shapes and sizes.,\n\nA boomerang is also known as a '''''trashy song''''' written by [[JoJo Siwa]], a spoiled brat who is used in a bow company and was on a TV show called [[Dance Moms]]. She quit because she was too much of a [[wimp]] to handle being there.\n\n== Description ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nA boomerang is a [[throwing stick]] with certain [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] properties, traditionally made of wood, but boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones. Modern boomerangs used for sport may be made from plywood or plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird, and many other less common types.\n\nAn important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[ellipse]], returning to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces are therefore symmetrical and not with the aerofoils that give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.\n\nThe most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or kylies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of [[#Modern usage|various shapes or sizes]].\n\nJust like the hunting boomerang of the Aboriginal Australians, the valari also did not return to the thrower but flew straight. Boomerangs used in competitions have specially designed air-foiling mechanism to enable return, but the hunting Boomerangs are meant to float straight and hit the target. Valaris are made in many shapes and sizes. The history of the valari is rooted in ancient times and evidences can be found in Tamil Sangam literature \"Purananuru\". The usual form consists of two limbs set at an angle; one is thin and tapering while the other is rounded and is used as a handle. Valaris are usually made of iron which is melted and poured into moulds, although some may have wooden limbs tipped with iron. Alternatively, the limbs may have lethally sharpened edges; special daggers are known as [[kattari]], double-edged and razor sharp, may be attached to some valari.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the term is uncertain. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct [[Australian Aboriginal language|Aboriginal language]] of [[New South Wales]], Australia, but mentions a variant, ''wo-mur-rang'', which it dates to 1798.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boomerang&searchmode=none Boomerang], [http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary].</ref> The first recorded encounter with a boomerang by Europeans was at [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]] ([[Port Jackson]]), in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal [[Skirmisher|skirmish]]:<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626558 |title=SYDNEY |publisher= NLA Australian Newspapers |accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|... the ''white'' spectators were justly astonished at the dexterity and incredible force with which a bent, edged waddy resembling slightly a Turkish [[scimitar|scimytar]], was thrown by ''Bungary'', a native distinguished by his remarkable courtesy.

There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; [[maximum time aloft]]; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch [[plywood]], [[hardwood]], plastic or [[composite material]]s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than {{convert|100|g|oz}}, with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under {{convert|25|g|oz|1}}.\n\nBoomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to [[clay pigeons]] in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.<ref>{{cite av media |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwv2BhJEjDo |title= Aussie Boomerang Shootin' |date= 15 October 2012 |via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe modern boomerang is often [[computer-aided design]]ed with precision airfoils. The number of \"wings\" is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2.<ref>[http://www.boomerangs.com/aerodynamics.html Boomerang Aerodynamics], [http://www.boomerangs.com/ boomerangs.com].</ref><ref>Saulius Pakalnis, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/boomerang_site/boomerang1.htm Aerodynamics of Boomerang], 21 April 2006, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/ researchsupporttechnologies.com].</ref>\n\nIn 1992, German astronaut [[Ulf Merbold]] performed an experiment aboard [[Spacelab]] that established that boomerangs function in [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] as they do on Earth.

These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects may not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. Designs are very diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse. Some boomerangs made primarily as art objects do not have the required aerodynamic properties to return.\n\n== Aerodynamics ==\nA returning boomerang is a rotating wing. It consists of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle; each wing is shaped as an [[airfoil]] section. Although it is not a requirement that a boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat.\n\nBoomerangs can be made for right- or left-handed throwers. The difference between right and left is subtle, the planform is the same but the leading edges of the aerofoil sections are reversed. A right-handed boomerang makes a counter-clockwise, circular flight to the left while a left-handed boomerang flies clockwise to the right.\nMost sport boomerangs weigh between {{convert|70|and|110|g|oz}}, have a {{convert|250|-|350|mm|inch}} wingspan and a {{cvt|20|-|40|m|yd|0}} range.\n\nA falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curved rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.\nAs the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, the airflow over the wings creates lift on both \"wings\". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright, each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.<ref name=hyper>{{cite web |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html |title= Boomerang |work=gsu.edu}}</ref> While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, the [[gyroscopic precession]] causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, causing it to turn.<ref name=hyper/> When thrown in the horizontal plane, as with a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], instead of in the vertical, the same gyroscopic precession will cause the boomerang to fly violently, straight up into the air and then crash.\n\nFast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title= baggressive.com |publisher= Baggressive.com |date= 19 April 2005 |accessdate= 3 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224082313/http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |archive-date= 24 December 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an \"auto-rotation\" effect to maximise the boomerang's hover time in descending from the highest point in its flight.\n\nSome boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s\u00a0\u2014 bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).\n\n== Throwing technique ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n\nBoomerangs are generally thrown in unobstructed, open spaces at least twice as large as the range of the boomerang. The flight direction, left or right depends upon the boomerang, not the thrower. A right-handed or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers find awkward. The following technique applies to a right-handed boomerang, the directions are mirrored for a left-handed boomerang. Different boomerang designs have different flight characteristics and are suitable for different conditions. The accuracy of the throw depends on understanding the weight and aerodynamics of that particular boomerang, and the strength, consistency and direction of the wind; from this, the thrower chooses the angle of tilt, the angle against the wind, the elevation of the trajectory, the degree of spin and the strength of the throw. A great deal of trial and error is required to perfect the throw over time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rangsboomerangs.com/boomerang-list/boomerang-throwing-instructions |title=BOOMERANG THROWING INSTRUCTIONS |website=www.rangsboomerangs.com |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\nA properly thrown boomerang will travel out parallel to the ground, sometimes climbing gently, perform a graceful, anti-clockwise, circular or tear-drop shaped arc, flatten out and return in a hovering motion, coming in from the left or spiralling in from behind. Ideally, the hover will allow a practiced catcher to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.\n\nThe grip used depends on size and shape; smaller boomerangs are held between finger and thumb at one end, while larger, heavier or wider boomerangs with one or two fingers wrapped over the top edge in order to induce a spin. The aerofoil-shaped section must face the inside of the thrower, and the flatter side outwards. It is usually inclined outwards, from a nearly vertical position to 20\u00b0 or 30\u00b0; the stronger the wind, the closer to vertical.  The elbow of the boomerang can point forwards or backwards, or it can be gripped for throwing; it just needs to start spinning on the required inclination, in the desired direction, with the right force.\n\nThe boomerang is aimed to the right of the oncoming wind; the exact angle depends on the strength of the wind and the boomerang itself. Left-handed boomerangs are thrown to the left of the wind and will fly a clockwise flight path. The trajectory is either parallel to the ground or slightly upwards. The boomerang can return without the aid of any wind, but even very slight winds must be taken into account however calm it may seem. Little or no wind is preferable for an accurate throw, light winds up to {{convert|3|-|5|knots|sigfig=1}} are manageable with skill. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it may be too strong without a skilled thrower with a boomerang designed for stability in stronger winds. Gusty days are a great challenge, and the thrower must be keenly aware of the ebb and flow of the wind strength, finding appropriate lulls in the gusts to launch their boomerang.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Throw-a-Boomerang |title=How to Throw a Boomerang |website=wikiHow |language=en |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boomerangs.com/pages/how-to-throw-boomerangs |title=How To Throw Boomerangs! |website=Boomerangs.com |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/throw-boomerang.htm |title=How Do You Throw a Boomerang So That It Comes Back to You? |date=2001-09-06 |website=HowStuffWorks |language=en |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n== Competitions and records ==\n\nA World Record achievement was made on 3 June 2007 by Tim Lendrum in Aussie Round. Tim scored 96 out of 100, giving him a National Record as well as an equal World Record throwing an \"AYR\" made by expert boomerang maker Adam Carroll.\n\nIn international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2017}}, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower Manuel Sch\u00fctz. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 Fridolin Frost from Germany won the title.\n\nThe team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian Alejandro Palacio. In 2016 USA became team world champion.\n\n=== Competition disciplines ===\n\nModern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below<ref name=\"German Wikipedia\">Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.\n\nEvents include:\n\n* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.\n* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.\n* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.\n* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.\n* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling, the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.\n* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.\n* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.\n* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning, the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught. A special section is dedicated to LD below.\n* ''Juggling'': as with Consecutive Catch, only with two boomerangs. At any given time one boomerang must be in the air.\n\n=== World records ===\n{{updated|September 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Discipline\n! Result\n! Name\n! Year\n!

In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] projection of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and throwers may be happy simply not to walk too far to recover the boomerang.\n\n=== General properties ===\nLong-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.\n\nToday's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? \u2013 question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass [[epoxy]] composites.\n\n=== Flight path ===\nThe projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.\n\nFrom theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).\n\n== Related terms ==\nIn [[Noongar language]], ''kylie'' is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals.<ref>{{cite web |title= Language {{!}} Kaartdijin Noongar |url= https://www.noongarculture.org.au/language/ |website= www.noongarculture.org.au |publisher= SWLASC |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\"Kylie\" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm|title=Whence comes, and what is a boomerang|website=bumerang-sport.de|access-date=26 July 2017}}</ref> Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning \"boomerang\" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] word \"karli\".\n\n== Cultural references ==\nTrademarks of Australian companies using the boomerang as a symbol, emblem or logo proliferate, usually removed from Aboriginal context and symbolising 'returning'<ref>Jones, P.

A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by some [[Aboriginal Australian]] peoples for hunting.\n\nBoomerangs have been historically used for [[Hunting in Australia|hunting]], as well as sport and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Boomerang: Behind an Australian Icon|last = Jones|first = Philip|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9781862543829|location = |pages = }}</ref> and come in various shapes and sizes.\n\n== Description ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nA boomerang is a [[throwing stick]] with certain [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] properties, traditionally made of wood, but boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones. Modern boomerangs used for sport may be made from plywood or plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird, and many other less common types.\n\nAn important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[ellipse]], returning to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces are therefore symmetrical and not with the aerofoils that give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.\n\nThe most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or kylies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of [[#Modern usage|various shapes or sizes]].\n\nJust like the hunting boomerang of the Aboriginal Australians, the valari also did not return to the thrower but flew straight. Boomerangs used in competitions have specially designed air-foiling mechanism to enable return, but the hunting Boomerangs are meant to float straight and hit the target. Valaris are made in many shapes and sizes. The history of the valari is rooted in ancient times and evidences can be found in Tamil Sangam literature \"Purananuru\". The usual form consists of two limbs set at an angle; one is thin and tapering while the other is rounded and is used as a handle. Valaris are usually made of iron which is melted and poured into moulds, although some may have wooden limbs tipped with iron. Alternatively, the limbs may have lethally sharpened edges; special daggers are known as [[kattari]], double-edged and razor sharp, may be attached to some valari.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the term is uncertain. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct [[Australian Aboriginal language|Aboriginal language]] of [[New South Wales]], Australia, but mentions a variant, ''wo-mur-rang'', which it dates to 1798.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=boomerang&searchmode=none Boomerang], [http://www.etymonline.com/ Online Etymology Dictionary].</ref> The first recorded encounter with a boomerang by Europeans was at [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]] ([[Port Jackson]]), in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal [[Skirmisher|skirmish]]:<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626558 |title=SYDNEY |publisher= NLA Australian Newspapers |accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|... the ''white'' spectators were justly astonished at the dexterity and incredible force with which a bent, edged waddy resembling slightly a Turkish [[scimitar|scimytar]], was thrown by ''Bungary'', a native distinguished by his remarkable courtesy.

The curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to \"tune\" their throwing sticks to fly straight.<ref name=\"Boomer\" />\n\nIt is thought by some that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting birds and small animals, or that noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air, or, by a skilled thrower, lightly clipping leaves of a tree whose branches house birds, would help scare the birds towards the thrower. It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Lloyd |first1= John |last2= Mitchinson |first2= John |title= The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher= Mackays of Chatham |isbn= 978-0-571-23368-7 |page= 244 }}</ref> In southeastern Australia, it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTraditionally, most boomerangs used by Aboriginal groups in Australia were non-returning.

Throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's Aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.\n\n== Modern usage ==\n[[File:sportbumerangs.jpg|thumb|Sport boomerangs]]\nToday, boomerangs are mostly used for recreation. There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; [[maximum time aloft]]; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch [[plywood]], [[hardwood]], plastic or [[composite material]]s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than {{convert|100|g|oz}}, with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under {{convert|25|g|oz|1}}.\n\nBoomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to [[clay pigeons]] in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.<ref>{{cite av media |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwv2BhJEjDo |title= Aussie Boomerang Shootin' |date= 15 October 2012 |via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe modern boomerang is often [[computer-aided design]]ed with precision airfoils. The number of \"wings\" is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2.<ref>[http://www.boomerangs.com/aerodynamics.html Boomerang Aerodynamics], [http://www.boomerangs.com/ boomerangs.com].</ref><ref>Saulius Pakalnis, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/boomerang_site/boomerang1.htm Aerodynamics of Boomerang], 21 April 2006, [http://www.researchsupporttechnologies.com/ researchsupporttechnologies.com].</ref>\n\nIn 1992, German astronaut [[Ulf Merbold]] performed an experiment aboard [[Spacelab]] that established that boomerangs function in [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] as they do on Earth.

These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects may not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. Designs are very diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse. Some boomerangs made primarily as art objects do not have the required aerodynamic properties to return.\n\n== Aerodynamics ==\nA returning boomerang is a rotating wing. It consists of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle; each wing is shaped as an [[airfoil]] section. Although it is not a requirement that a boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat.\n\nBoomerangs can be made for right- or left-handed throwers. The difference between right and left is subtle, the planform is the same but the leading edges of the aerofoil sections are reversed. A right-handed boomerang makes a counter-clockwise, circular flight to the left while a left-handed boomerang flies clockwise to the right.\nMost sport boomerangs weigh between {{convert|70|and|110|g|oz}}, have a {{convert|250|-|350|mm|inch}} wingspan and a {{cvt|20|-|40|m|yd|0}} range.\n\nA falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curved rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.\nAs the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, the airflow over the wings creates lift on both \"wings\". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright, each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.<ref name=hyper>{{cite web |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html |title= Boomerang |work=gsu.edu}}</ref> While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, the [[gyroscopic precession]] causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, causing it to turn.<ref name=hyper/> When thrown in the horizontal plane, as with a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], instead of in the vertical, the same gyroscopic precession will cause the boomerang to fly violently, straight up into the air and then crash.\n\nFast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title= baggressive.com |publisher= Baggressive.com |date= 19 April 2005 |accessdate= 3 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224082313/http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |archive-date= 24 December 2008 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an \"auto-rotation\" effect to maximise the boomerang's hover time in descending from the highest point in its flight.\n\nSome boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s\u00a0\u2014 bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).\n\n== Throwing technique ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n\nBoomerangs are generally thrown in unobstructed, open spaces at least twice as large as the range of the boomerang. The flight direction, left or right depends upon the boomerang, not the thrower. A right-handed or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers find awkward. The following technique applies to a right-handed boomerang, the directions are mirrored for a left-handed boomerang. Different boomerang designs have different flight characteristics and are suitable for different conditions. The accuracy of the throw depends on understanding the weight and aerodynamics of that particular boomerang, and the strength, consistency and direction of the wind; from this, the thrower chooses the angle of tilt, the angle against the wind, the elevation of the trajectory, the degree of spin and the strength of the throw. A great deal of trial and error is required to perfect the throw over time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rangsboomerangs.com/boomerang-list/boomerang-throwing-instructions |title=BOOMERANG THROWING INSTRUCTIONS |website=www.rangsboomerangs.com |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\nA properly thrown boomerang will travel out parallel to the ground, sometimes climbing gently, perform a graceful, anti-clockwise, circular or tear-drop shaped arc, flatten out and return in a hovering motion, coming in from the left or spiralling in from behind. Ideally, the hover will allow a practiced catcher to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.\n\nThe grip used depends on size and shape; smaller boomerangs are held between finger and thumb at one end, while larger, heavier or wider boomerangs with one or two fingers wrapped over the top edge in order to induce a spin. The aerofoil-shaped section must face the inside of the thrower, and the flatter side outwards. It is usually inclined outwards, from a nearly vertical position to 20\u00b0 or 30\u00b0; the stronger the wind, the closer to vertical.  The elbow of the boomerang can point forwards or backwards, or it can be gripped for throwing; it just needs to start spinning on the required inclination, in the desired direction, with the right force.\n\nThe boomerang is aimed to the right of the oncoming wind; the exact angle depends on the strength of the wind and the boomerang itself. Left-handed boomerangs are thrown to the left of the wind and will fly a clockwise flight path. The trajectory is either parallel to the ground or slightly upwards. The boomerang can return without the aid of any wind, but even very slight winds must be taken into account however calm it may seem. Little or no wind is preferable for an accurate throw, light winds up to {{convert|3|-|5|knots|sigfig=1}} are manageable with skill. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it may be too strong without a skilled thrower with a boomerang designed for stability in stronger winds. Gusty days are a great challenge, and the thrower must be keenly aware of the ebb and flow of the wind strength, finding appropriate lulls in the gusts to launch their boomerang.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Throw-a-Boomerang |title=How to Throw a Boomerang |website=wikiHow |language=en |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boomerangs.com/pages/how-to-throw-boomerangs |title=How To Throw Boomerangs! |website=Boomerangs.com |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/throw-boomerang.htm |title=How Do You Throw a Boomerang So That It Comes Back to You? |date=2001-09-06 |website=HowStuffWorks |language=en |access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n== Competitions and records ==\n\nA World Record achievement was made on 3 June 2007 by Tim Lendrum in Aussie Round. Tim scored 96 out of 100, giving him a National Record as well as an equal World Record throwing an \"AYR\" made by expert boomerang maker Adam Carroll.\n\nIn international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2017}}, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower Manuel Sch\u00fctz. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 Fridolin Frost from Germany won the title.\n\nThe team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian Alejandro Palacio. In 2016 USA became team world champion.\n\n=== Competition disciplines ===\n\nModern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below<ref name=\"German Wikipedia\">Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.\n\nEvents include:\n\n* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.\n* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.\n* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.\n* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.\n* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling, the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.\n* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.\n* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.\n* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning, the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught. A special section is dedicated to LD below.\n* ''Juggling'': as with Consecutive Catch, only with two boomerangs. At any given time one boomerang must be in the air.\n\n=== World records ===\n{{updated|September 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Discipline\n! Result\n! Name\n! Year\n!

In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] projection of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and throwers may be happy simply not to walk too far to recover the boomerang.\n\n=== General properties ===\nLong-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.\n\nToday's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? \u2013 question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass [[epoxy]] composites.\n\n=== Flight path ===\nThe projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.\n\nFrom theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).\n\n== Related terms ==\nIn [[Noongar language]], ''kylie'' is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals.<ref>{{cite web |title= Language {{!}} Kaartdijin Noongar |url= https://www.noongarculture.org.au/language/ |website= www.noongarculture.org.au |publisher= SWLASC |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\"Kylie\" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm|title=Whence comes, and what is a boomerang|website=bumerang-sport.de|access-date=26 July 2017}}</ref> Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning \"boomerang\" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] word \"karli\".\n\n== Cultural references ==\nTrademarks of Australian companies using the boomerang as a symbol, emblem or logo proliferate, usually removed from Aboriginal context and symbolising 'returning'<ref>Jones, P.
