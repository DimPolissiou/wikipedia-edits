D.]] (born 7 March 1934) is an Indigenous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[architect]] based in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. His flowing architecture marked with smooth curvilinear forms is influenced by his [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage as well as European [[Expressionist architecture]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-joseph-cardinal/ Douglas Cardinal], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref>This passion for unconventional forms and appreciation of nature and landscape was present in his life from the very young age. It consequently developed into his unique architectural style that he followed throughout his career. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] (1989) and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1998).<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=39}}</ref> He is considered one of the most influential Canadian architects, who shaped and preserved indigenous architecture and culture in the modern history.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Calgary, Alberta]], Cardinal is the eldest of eight children of Joseph and Frances Cardinal. His father was of [[Blackfoot]]/Kainai and Algonquin heritage, and his mother was of German and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] descent.<ref name=\"CE\"/> His mother worked as a nurse and was very well educated. Cardinal's parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father\u2019s tribe\u2019s societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Douglas Cardinal|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume=Vol. 63, Iss. 2|pages=30-32|via=}}</ref> These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal\u2019s upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an architect,\u201d he later remembered his mother pushing and believing in him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nCardinal grew up in a small city of [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. He was sent to St. Joseph's Convent Catholic Residential school. Later he attended the remaining high school years in Red Deer. His religious school influenced him immensely. Living away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. [[Grey Nuns]] of convent school taught him about arts and culture, which also determined his future career. Traditional sacral architecture and its role in the culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he started studying architecture in the [[University of British Columbia]], or UBC. He attended the institution for two years and had to leave due to his radical ideas. His different approach towards architecture did not align with the ideas of modernism at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to the nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s.<ref name=\":1\" /> In his third year of studies, he was told by the director at UBC that Cardinal had \"a wrong background\" for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver, he returned to Red Deer and started working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian university again. Cardinal himself also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards indigenous people in his home country.<ref name=\":1\" /> He decided to head south, quickly stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas. Eventually, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which he graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1963.\n\nIn university, he also studied cultural anthropology, because his cultural heritage and philosophy were based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and didn\u2019t feel that the buildings were designed around people. His philosophy also intertwines with the philosophy of another famous architect [[Rudolf Steiner|Rudolph Steiner]], whom Douglas studied in University of Texas. Steiner\u2019s work inspired Douglas to study [[anthropomorphism]], which he applied to his work as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to the human behavior, natural cycle of life and beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal's philosophy and his cultural heritage. Another great inspiration for Cardinal were works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. He appreciated his organic way of responding to landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=17}}</ref> The racism he was experiencing in Canada was subsided after he moved to Texas. He accepted his indigenous heritage and one of his professors encouraged him to learn more about his background.\n\n==Career==\nCardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta.<ref>https://www.stmarysparishreddeer.com/parish/history/</ref> Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007 the church was featured on a Canada Post stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (RAIC).<ref>https://postagestampguide.com/stamps/17713/st-mary-s-church-2007-canada-postage-stamp-royal-architectural-institute-of-canada-100-years</ref>\n\nBeginning with his work on St. Mary's, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out exact dimensions of the buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he was hired by The [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the Primary Design Architect for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], or NMAI. The NMAI is situated on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and directly faces the Capital of the United States of America. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building's design.\n\nIn 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn.  The [[Discovery Park of America]] was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community.  Early in 2009 the firm's contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.\n[[File:Douglas Cardinal.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Douglas Cardinal in 1970s]]\n\n=== Architectural Style and Philosophy ===\nThroughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=26}}</ref> In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans' inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriachial society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:St. Mary's Church, Red Deer, Alberta.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal's first building - St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta]]\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\nSt. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal's first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nThe church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian Museum of History ===\n[[File:Gatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation2.jpg|thumb|Canadian Museum of History|alt=]]This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal's architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing [[Parliament Hill]]. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=28}}</ref> The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=29}}</ref> He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=34}}</ref> Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister's idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal's vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=31}}</ref> The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 new government was not approving of Cardinal's design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became on of his many fundamental projects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n=== The Group of Seven ===\nIn 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as [[Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Seven]]. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included Greatest Canadian Postwar Architects, along with Moshe Safdie, Raymond Moriyama, Eberhard Zeidler, Arthur Erickson, Ray Affleck and Ron Thom.

Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nShortly before he decided to go the the Unites States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work.<ref name=\":7\" /> His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.\n\nHe married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHis current wife Idoia Arana-Beobide is also of Basque indigenous heritage.

D.]] (born 7 March 1934) is an Indigenous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[architect]] based in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada. His flowing architecture marked with smooth curvilinear forms is influenced by his [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage as well as European [[Expressionist architecture]].<ref name=\"CE\">[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-joseph-cardinal/ Douglas Cardinal], The Canadian Encyclopedia</ref>This passion for unconventional forms and appreciation of nature and landscape was present in his life from the very young age. It consequently developed into his unique architectural style that he followed throughout his career. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau, Quebec]] (1989) and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1998).<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=39}}</ref> He is considered one of the most influential Canadian architects, who shaped and preserved indigenous architecture and culture in the modern history.\n\n==Life==\nBorn in [[Calgary, Alberta]], Cardinal is the eldest of eight children of Joseph and Frances Cardinal. His father was of [[Blackfoot]]/Kainai and Algonquin heritage, and his mother was of German and [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] descent.<ref name=\"CE\"/> His mother worked as a nurse and was very well educated. Cardinal's parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father\u2019s tribe\u2019s societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2018|title=Douglas Cardinal|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume=Vol. 63, Iss. 2|pages=30-32|via=}}</ref> These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal\u2019s upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an architect,\u201d he later remembered his mother pushing and believing in him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nCardinal grew up in a small city of [[Red Deer, Alberta]]. He was sent to St. Joseph's Convent Catholic Residential school. Later he attended the remaining high school years in Red Deer. His religious school influenced him immensely. Living away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. [[Grey Nuns]] of convent school taught him about arts and culture, which also determined his future career. Traditional sacral architecture and its role in the culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he started studying architecture in the [[University of British Columbia]], or UBC. He attended the institution for two years and had to leave due to his radical ideas. His different approach towards architecture did not align with the ideas of modernism at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to the nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s.<ref name=\":1\" /> In his third year of studies, he was told by the director at UBC that Cardinal had \"a wrong background\" for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver, he returned to Red Deer and started working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian university again. Cardinal himself also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards indigenous people in his home country.<ref name=\":1\" /> He decided to head south, quickly stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas. Eventually, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], from which he graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1963.\n\nIn university, he also studied cultural anthropology, because his cultural heritage and philosophy were based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and didn\u2019t feel that the buildings were designed around people. His philosophy also intertwines with the philosophy of another famous architect [[Rudolf Steiner|Rudolph Steiner]], whom Douglas studied in University of Texas. Steiner\u2019s work inspired Douglas to study [[anthropomorphism]], which he applied to his work as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to the human behavior, natural cycle of life and beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal's philosophy and his cultural heritage. Another great inspiration for Cardinal were works of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. He appreciated his organic way of responding to landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=17}}</ref> The racism he was experiencing in Canada was subsided after he moved to Texas. He accepted his indigenous heritage and one of his professors encouraged him to learn more about his background.\n\n==Career==\nCardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta.<ref>https://www.stmarysparishreddeer.com/parish/history/</ref> Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007 the church was featured on a Canada Post stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (RAIC).<ref>https://postagestampguide.com/stamps/17713/st-mary-s-church-2007-canada-postage-stamp-royal-architectural-institute-of-canada-100-years</ref>\n\nBeginning with his work on St. Mary's, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out exact dimensions of the buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he was hired by The [[Smithsonian Institution]] as the Primary Design Architect for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], or NMAI. The NMAI is situated on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and directly faces the Capital of the United States of America. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building's design.\n\nIn 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn.  The [[Discovery Park of America]] was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community.  Early in 2009 the firm's contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.\n[[File:Douglas Cardinal.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Douglas Cardinal in 1970s]]\n\n=== Architectural Style and Philosophy ===\nThroughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=26}}</ref> In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights.<ref name=\":2\" /> This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans' inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriachial society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:St. Mary's Church, Red Deer, Alberta.jpg|left|thumb|Cardinal's first building - St. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta]]\n\n=== St. Mary's Church ===\nSt. Mary's Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal's first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=22}}</ref>\n\nThe church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=24}}</ref>\n\n=== Canadian Museum of History ===\n[[File:Gatineau - QC - Museum of Civilisation2.jpg|thumb|Canadian Museum of History|alt=]]This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal's architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing [[Parliament Hill]]. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=28}}</ref> The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=29}}</ref> He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=34}}</ref> Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister's idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal's vision.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=31}}</ref> The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 new government was not approving of Cardinal's design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became on of his many fundamental projects.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n=== The Group of Seven ===\nIn 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as [[Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Seven]]. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included Greatest Canadian Postwar Architects, along with Moshe Safdie, Raymond Moriyama, Eberhard Zeidler, Arthur Erickson, Ray Affleck and Ron Thom.

Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nShortly before he decided to go the the Unites States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work.<ref name=\":7\" /> His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.\n\nHe married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHis current wife Idoia Arana-Beobide is also of Basque indigenous heritage. Together they have two children.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hall|first=Joseph|title=The Outsider: How Douglas Cardinal Draws Genius from Native Roots|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Limited|year=July 14, 2014|isbn=9780887858017|location=Toronto, ON|pages=46}}</ref> His wife works as a director at his architectural firm.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHall, J.

Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th but after spending 100 million in recent years on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 who had previously secured 4th 3rd 4th place finishes a Uafer cup semi final and Champions League semi final was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final

Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th which after spending 100 million in recent years on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final

It was announced during [[E3 2019]] as \"'''Project Scarlett'''\" and scheduled for release in late 2020.\n\nThe console is one of the planned fourth-generation family of [[Xbox]] hardware, succeeding the current [[Xbox One]] line, and expected to have improved hardware for higher display resolutions and frame rate and reduced loading times. Microsoft plans to have this be a soft transition to its next generation of hardware; the Xbox Series X is expected to be fully compatible with all games, controllers, and accessories that are currently supported by Xbox One, including selected [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] games already backward compatible on the Xbox One. Further, Microsoft's internal [[Xbox Game Studios]] does not plan to immediately produce titles exclusive for the Xbox Series X, but instead will produce titles that are compatible on both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X, with certain titles having enhanced features on the new console.\n\n== History and development ==\nWhen Microsoft's Xbox team started work on the next hardware system after the Xbox One, their primary target was to at minimum double the graphic performance of the new console, as measured by its [[FLOPS|floating point operations per second (FLOPS)]], compared to the [[Xbox One X]]'s current 6 teraFLOPS (TFLOPS), and a four-fold improvement in the CPU performance while maintaining the same acoustic performance.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\">{{cite web | url = Building Xbox Series X: why Microsoft redefined the console form factor | first = Richard | last = Leadbetter | date = March 28, 2020 | accessdate = March 29, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As the engineers collected power requirements to meet these specifications, they saw these parts would draw a large amount of internal power (approximately 315&nbsp;[[watt|W]]) and would generate a good amount of heat. This lead to the decision to split the components onto two separate circuit boards; one housing the CPU/GPU, memory, and power regulators, and a second board to act as a [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridge]] board for slower [[input/output]] (I/O) functions.

It was announced during [[E3 2019]] as \"'''Project Scarlett'''\" and scheduled for release in late 2020.\n\nThe console is one of the planned fourth-generation family of [[Xbox]] hardware, succeeding the current [[Xbox One]] line, and expected to have improved hardware for higher display resolutions and frame rate and reduced loading times. Microsoft plans to have this be a soft transition to its next generation of hardware; the Xbox Series X is expected to be fully compatible with all games, controllers, and accessories that are currently supported by Xbox One, including selected [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] games already backward compatible on the Xbox One. Further, Microsoft's internal [[Xbox Game Studios]] does not plan to immediately produce titles exclusive for the Xbox Series X, but instead will produce titles that are compatible on both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X, with certain titles having enhanced features on the new console.\n\n== History and development ==\nWhen Microsoft's Xbox team started work on the next hardware system after the Xbox One, their primary target was to at minimum double the graphic performance of the new console, as measured by its [[FLOPS|floating point operations per second (FLOPS)]], compared to the [[Xbox One X]]'s current 6 teraFLOPS (TFLOPS), and a four-fold improvement in the CPU performance while maintaining the same acoustic performance.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\">{{cite web | url = Building Xbox Series X: why Microsoft redefined the console form factor | first = Richard | last = Leadbetter | date = March 28, 2020 | accessdate = March 29, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As the engineers collected power requirements to meet these specifications, they saw these parts would draw a large amount of internal power (approximately 315&nbsp;[[watt|W]]) and would generate a good amount of heat. This lead to the decision to split the components onto two separate circuit boards; one housing the CPU/GPU, memory, and power regulators, and a second board to act as a [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridge]] board for slower [[input/output]] (I/O) functions. The boards mounted on opposite sides of an aluminum chassis helped to create air channels for cooling. The remaining components - the [[heat sink]], the [[Electromagnetic shielding|electric shielding]], the [[power supply]], the [[optical drive]], and the [[cooling fan]] were then arranged in a ''[[Tetris]]''-like fashion, according to Microsoft designer Chris Kujawski, to achieve a compact form factor, resulting in the tower-like structure.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/> To meet the acoustics factor, the system includes numerous sensors for controls the speed of the fan, and the large open top was necessary to assure good air flow through the system.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/> While certain elements like the optical drive, air flow requirements, and heat sink size fixed certain dimensions in the overall form factor, they were satisified they were able to end up with a square footprint for the unit.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/>\n\nMicrosoft first teased new Xbox hardware under the codename \"Project Scarlett\" during its [[E3 2019]] press conference,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019|title=Microsoft hints at next-generation Xbox \u2018Scarlet\u2019 in E3 teasers|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2019-06-08|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609004254/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019|archive-date=2019-06-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The company estimated that Scarlett would be four times as powerful as Xbox One X,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18656608/microsoft-new-xbox-hardware-specs-price-release-date-e3-2019|title=Microsoft\u2019s next-generation Xbox: 8K graphics, SSD storage, and ray tracing for 2020|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=June 9, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref> with support for [[8K resolution]], real-time [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing]], and 120 frames-per-second rendering.<ref name=\":3\" /> Microsoft said they wanted a soft transition from Xbox One to Scarlett, with Scarlett supporting [[backward compatibility]] with all games and most hardware supported on the Xbox One.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/368875/microsoft-teases-xbox-project-scarlett-tons-of-games-keanu|title=Microsoft Teases Xbox Project Scarlett, Tons of Games, Keanu|last=Greenwald|first=Will|website=PCmag.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> The console was formally unveiled as the Xbox Series X during [[The Game Awards]] 2019, as well as its final design and a late-2020 release date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-exclusive-details-meet-microsofts-ne/1100-6472190/|title=Xbox Series X Exclusive Details: Meet Microsoft's Next-Gen Console|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref name=\"verge series x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console|title=Microsoft\u2019s next Xbox is Xbox Series X, coming holiday 2020|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 12, 2019|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213021743/https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console|archive-date=December 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the unveiling, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that Xbox Series X constituted an entry in a fourth generation of Xbox hardware, which will be branded simply as \"Xbox\" with no subtitle.<ref name=\"xbox g4 naming\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/xbox-scarlett/2019/12/16/21025133/xbox-series-x-name-scarlett|title=The next generation of Xbox is just called ...
