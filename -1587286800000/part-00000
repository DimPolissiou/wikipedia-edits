It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war,<ref>Heidler (2004), p. 161.</ref> and one of the deadliest battles ever fought in [[Canada]].<ref>Belanger (2009), p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe battle was a tactical draw with both sides left on the battlefield but a British strategic victory because the Americans had suffered so many casualties that they were now outnumbered and forced to withdraw. There were over 1,500 casualties including 258 killed.\n\n==Background==\nOn 3 July 1814 an American army under Major General [[Jacob Brown]] launched an attack across the [[Niagara River]] near its source on [[Lake Erie]]. His force quickly [[Capture of Fort Erie|captured]] the British position at [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] and then advanced north. Two days later one of his two brigades of regular U.S. Infantry under Brigadier General [[Winfield Scott]] defeated a British force commanded by Major General [[Phineas Riall]] at the [[Battle of Chippawa]].\n\nA few days after the battle Brown [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] the British defences along the [[Welland River|Chippawa River]] and the British fell back to [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] near the mouth of the Niagara on [[Lake Ontario]]. Brown lacked the necessary troops and heavy artillery to attack this position. At the time a British naval squadron controlled the lake. Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]], commander of the American ships based at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]], was waiting for new frigates and heavily armed brigs to be completed before he could challenge the British squadron. When these were finally ready to sail, the American squadron was further delayed in port when Chauncey fell ill. As a result, no reinforcements or heavy guns could be sent to Brown while the British were able to move several units across the lake from [[Toronto, Ontario|York]] to reinforce Fort George.<ref name=Graves104>Graves (1997), p. 104.</ref>\n\nFor most of July, Brown's army occupied [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]] a few miles south of Fort George. In this forward position they were harassed by Canadian militia and [[First Nation]]s. On 24 July Brown fell back to the Chippawa River intending to secure his supplies before advancing west to [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]].<ref name=Graves104/> As soon as Brown retired, British light infantry and militia under Major General Riall advanced to Lundy's Lane {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of the Chippawa to allow light troops to maintain contact with the American main force.<ref>Graves (1999), p. 107.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n===Preliminary movements===\nEarly on 25 July, the British [[List of lieutenant governors of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Upper Canada]], Lieutenant General [[Gordon Drummond]], arrived in Fort George to take personal command on the Niagara peninsula. He immediately ordered a force under Lieutenant Colonel John Tucker to advance south from [[Fort Niagara]] (which the British had captured in December 1813) along the east side of the Niagara River, hoping this would force Brown to evacuate the west bank.<ref>Elting (1995), p. 190.</ref> Instead, Brown ordered an advance north, intending in turn to force the British to recall Tucker's column to protect Fort George. The Americans apparently did not know that the British held Lundy's Lane in strength.\n[[File:Gordon Drummond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The order to retreat to [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] was countermanded by Lieutenant General [[Gordon Drummond]], who instead ordered for reinforcements to support his position at Lundy's Lane.]]\nAs soon as Riall knew the Americans were advancing, he ordered his troops to fall back to Fort George and ordered another column under Colonel [[Hercules Scott]] to move from St. Davids to Queenston to cover his withdrawal, rather than advance to his support. These orders were countermanded by Drummond, who had force-marched a detachment of reinforcements to Lundy's Lane from Fort George. The British were still reoccupying their positions when the first American units came into view, at about 6:00&nbsp;pm.<ref>Elting (1995), p. 191.</ref>\n\n===Scott's attack===\nLundy's Lane was a spur from the main portage road alongside the Niagara River. It ran along the summit of some rising ground (about 25 feet higher than the surrounding area) and therefore commanded good views of the area. The British artillery (two 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns, one 5.5-inch [[howitzer]] and a [[Congreve rocket]] detachment) were massed in a cemetery at the highest point of the battlefield.\n\nThe American 1st Brigade of regulars under Winfield Scott emerged in the late afternoon from a forest into an open field and was badly mauled by the British artillery.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> Scott sent the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th U.S. Infantry]], commanded by Major [[Thomas Jesup]], to outflank the British left. The 25th found a disused track leading to a landing stage on the river and used it to pass round the British flank. They caught the British and Canadian units there (the light company of the 1st Battalion of the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th (King's) Regiment]] and the [[Canadian Units of the War of 1812#Full-time militia|Upper Canada Incorporated Militia Battalion]]) while they were redeploying and unaware of the American presence, and drove them back in confusion. The British and Canadians rallied, but had been driven off the Portage Road. Jesup sent Captain Ketchum's light infantry company to secure the junction of Lundy's Lane and the Portage Road. Ketchum's company captured large numbers of wounded and messengers, including Major General Riall who had been wounded in one arm and was riding to the rear. Most of the prisoners escaped when Ketchum himself, having briefly rejoined Jesup, ran into an enemy unit while trying to return to the main body of the American army, although Riall and militia cavalry leader Captain [[William Hamilton Merritt]] remained prisoners.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 138\u2013141.</ref>\n\nJesup's action and the steadiness of Scott's brigade nevertheless persuaded Drummond to withdraw his centre to maintain alignment with his left flank, and also pull back the [[Glengarry Light Infantry]], who had been harassing Scott's own left flank. The withdrawal of Drummond's center-left the artillery exposed in front of the infantry.<ref name=Graves145>Graves (1997), p. 145.</ref>\n\n===Brown's attack===\n[[File:AR Miller James.jpg|upright|thumb|After he was instructed to take British guns, Lt Col [[James Miller (general)|James Miller]], commander of the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st U.S. Infantry]], responded ''\"I'll try, Sir.\"'']]\nBy nightfall, Scott's brigade had suffered heavy casualties, but Brown had arrived with the American main body (the 2nd Brigade of regulars under Brigadier General [[Eleazer Wheelock Ripley]] and a brigade of volunteers from the militia under Brigadier General [[Peter B. Porter]]). As Ripley and Porter relieved Scott's brigade, Brown ordered the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st U.S. Infantry]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[James Miller (general)|James Miller]] to capture the British guns. Miller famously responded, ''\"I'll try, Sir\"''.<ref name=Elting193>Elting (1995), p.193</ref>\n\nWhile the British were distracted by another attack by the 1st U.S. Infantry on their right, Miller's troops deployed within a few yards of the British artillery. They fired a volley of [[musket]]ry which killed most of the gunners and followed up with a [[bayonet]] charge which captured the guns and drove the British centre from the hill. The British infantry immediately behind the guns (the 2nd Battalion of the [[89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot|89th Foot]]) tried to counter-attack, but were driven back by Miller and Ripley.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, the British column under Colonel Hercules Scott was arriving on the field, already tired from its unnecessary diversion via Queenston. Unaware of the changed situation, they blundered into Ripley's brigade and were also driven back in disorder, losing their own three 6-pounder guns. These were recovered by a charge by the light company of the [[41st Regiment of Foot|41st Foot]], but were either abandoned again<ref name=Graves145/> or remained in British hands but could not be brought into action as the drivers and gunners had been scattered.<ref name=Elting195>Elting (1995), p. 195.</ref>\n\n===Drummond's counter-attack===\nWhile the Americans tried to deploy their own artillery among the captured British guns, Drummond (who had been wounded in the neck) reorganized his troops and mounted a determined attempt to retake his own cannon. There was no subtlety; Drummond merely launched an attack in line, without attempting to use his many light infantry to harass or disorder the American line,<ref>Graves (1997), p. 167.</ref> or to locate any weak points in it. The attack was beaten back after a short-range musketry duel over the abandoned British guns, in which both sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 170\u2013171.</ref> The [[Glengarry Light Infantry]], who had once again begun to harass the American left flank, were mistaken for Americans by other British units and forced to withdraw after suffering casualties from British fire.\n[[File:Battle of Niagara Falls map.jpg|thumb|left|A map from 1869 that shows the positions of the American and British forces during the battle.]]\nUndeterred by his first failure, Drummond launched a second attack, using the same methods and formation as in the first. Although some American units wavered, they were rallied by Ripley and stood their ground.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 174.</ref> While the combat was taking place, Winfield Scott led his depleted brigade (which had been reorganized into a single ad-hoc battalion under Major [[Henry Leavenworth]]) in an unauthorized attack against Drummond's centre. Scott's brigade was engaged both by the British and by units of Ripley's brigade, who were not aware of the identity of the troops at which they were shooting. Drummond's line was driven back but Scott's men broke in disorder and retreated, before rallying on the American left.<ref>Elting (1995), p. 194.</ref> Scott rode off to join Jesup's regiment, still out on the right flank, but was severely wounded shortly afterwards.\n\nShortly before midnight, Drummond launched a third counter-attack, using every man he could find,<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 180\u2013181.</ref> although by this time the British line consisted of mixed-up detachments and companies, rather than organised regiments and battalions. The fighting over the artillery was even closer than before, with bayonets being used at one point, but again the exhausted British fell back.\n\n===End of the battle===\nBy midnight both sides were spent. On the American side only 700 men were still standing in the line. Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown were both severely wounded. Brown would soon recover but Scott's injury removed him from the campaign. With supplies and water short, Brown ordered a retreat. Porter and Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Hindman (Brown's artillery commander) protested but complied. Ripley was apparently left unaware of Brown's order until he realised that Hindman's artillery had been withdrawn.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> Although urged by Porter to maintain his position, he also withdrew.<ref name=Elting195/> The British still had 1,400 men on the field but they were in no condition to interfere with the American withdrawal. Drummond had ordered some units to hold the Portage Road and left some light infantry outposts near the Americans, but had withdrawn the remainder a short distance west along Lundy's Lane.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 187.</ref>\n\nThe American artillerymen had suffered severely during the fighting and Hindman had difficulty finding sufficient draught horses to get all his guns away. One American 6-pounder gun had been lost earlier during the close-range fighting when its drivers had been hit by musket fire and the horses drawing it had bolted into the British lines.<ref name=Elting193/> Hindman also had to abandon a howitzer with a broken carriage. However, the Americans were able to drag away one captured 6-pounder gun which had earlier been pushed to the bottom of the high ground in the centre of the former British position.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 183.</ref> Hindman later found some more horses and sent a team back to recover one of the prized British 24-pounder guns. The team was captured by British parties who were wandering around the battlefield.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map of the Niagara Frontier, 1869.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the Niagara Frontier in 1814. Following Lundy's Lane, American forces fell back to [[Old Fort Erie|Fort Erie]], losing the initiative on the [[Niagara Peninsula]].]]\nIn the early hours of the morning of 26 July, Brown ordered Ripley to recover the abandoned British guns the next day. Reinforcing his exhausted men with detachments which had been left at Chippawa, Ripley moved out at daybreak with 1,200 soldiers but found that Drummond had reoccupied the battlefield with 2,200 men.<ref name=Elting196>Elting (1995), p. 196.</ref> Ripley withdrew, unmolested. The American army fell back to Fort Erie, first deliberately destroying the old British fortifications along the Chippawa River and burning the bridges behind them. Because they were short of transport, they had to abandon or destroy much equipment and supplies to make room for the wounded on the available wagons. Drummond was later to claim from this that the Americans had retreated in disorder. After burying some of the British and Canadian dead on the battlefield and burning many American corpses in large funeral pyres, the British had themselves withdrawn to Queenston until Drummond received reinforcements.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn respect to the effect of the battle on the War, the British won a strategic victory, since the Americans on the Niagara had suffered so many casualties that they were now badly outnumbered, and were forced to retire to Fort Erie. Richard V. Barbuto says, \"On 26 July, Brown's plan to advance on Burlington Heights was irretrievably shattered... Drummond had secured the forts at the northern end of the Niagara, and he had blunted an American advance. Although there was still a lot of fight in both forces, the balance of combat power on the Niagara Peninsula had swung from the invaders to the defenders\".<ref name=\"Barbuto229\">Barbuto, p. 229</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\nThe British official casualty return had 84 killed, 559 wounded, 42 captured and 193 missing.<ref name=Graves1993173/> The Americans captured 19 British officers and 150 other ranks, giving a revised British casualty total of 84 killed, 559 wounded, 169 captured and 55 missing.<ref name=Graves1993174/>\n\nThe original American official casualty return, dated 30 July 1814, gave 171 dead, 572 wounded and 117 missing.<ref>Cruikshank, p. 421.</ref> A slightly later version gave the same number of killed and wounded but only 110 missing.<ref name=\"Wood164\"/> Donald Graves says, \"British records state that four officers and 75 Americans of other ranks captured at Lundy's Lane were imprisoned at Quebec in the autumn of 1814. The remainder of the missing were probably the wounded or dead left on the field after Ripley withdrew\".<ref name=\"Graves1993175\"/> Three officers of the 22nd U.S. Regiment of Infantry; Lieutenants William Sturgis, John D. Kehr and Robert M. Davidson, who appear on the casualty list as \"missing\" and \"supposed to be killed\"<ref>Cruikshank, p. 423.</ref> were later confirmed as having been killed on 25 July.<ref name=\"Whitehorne149-150\"/> This gives a revised American loss of 174 killed, 572 wounded, 79 captured and 28 missing. Graves speculates that the discrepancies in the proportions of killed and wounded men between British and American casualties may be accounted for by the Americans not collating their casualty returns until five days after the battle, when some of those originally listed as missing were confirmed to have been killed, and some severely wounded men had died of their wounds.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 197\u2013198.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nThere had been much fighting at close quarters. Veteran British officers, who had fought against French armies in the [[Peninsular War]], were horrified at the carnage they had witnessed at Lundy's Lane. Drummond reported, ''\"Of so determined a Character were'' <nowiki>[the American]</nowiki> ''attacks directed against our guns that our Artillery Men were bayonetted by the enemy in the Act of loading, and the muzzles of the Enemy's Guns were advanced within a few Yards of ours\"''. The battle confirmed that the American regular forces had evolved into a highly professional army. Scott is widely credited for this progress, having modelled and trained his troops using [[French Revolutionary Army]] drills and exercises, although not all the American units present at Lundy's Lane had benefitted from his personal training.<ref>Elting (1995), pp. 179\u2013180.</ref>\n\nEvidence compiled by [[Donald Graves]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] historian employed at the Directorate of History, Department of National Defence Canada, argues that General Drummond failed to use skirmish pickets to protect his guns, which were consequently captured by the Americans. Drummond also showed little tactical finesse during his counter-attacks, not using his light infantry to their best advantage and mounting only straightforward frontal attacks. American historian John R. Elting suggests that if Drummond had instead concentrated on the vulnerable American left flank, he might have won a decisive victory.<ref name=Elting196/> (Drummond had much administrative experience, but had previously seen action only in the abortive [[Flanders Campaign]] in 1794 as a comparatively junior officer, and in the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian campaign]] in 1801 as commander of a battalion.)\n\n==Battlefield and memorials==\n[[File:Lundy's Lane Historical Museum.jpg|upright|thumb|Lundy's Lane Historical Museum in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, on Lundy's Lane near the battle site.]]\nThe site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1937.<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0435&oqeName=Battle+of+Lundy%27%27s+Lane&oqfName=Bataille+de+la+ruelle+de+Lundy Battle of Lundy's Lane]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada.</ref><ref>{{CRHP|12081|Battle of Lundy's Lane|16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe site of the battle is now a residential and commercial area of Niagara Falls, Ontario.

It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war,<ref>Heidler (2004), p. 161.</ref> and one of the deadliest battles ever fought in [[Canada]].<ref>Belanger (2009), p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe battle was a tactical draw with both sides left on the battlefield but a British strategic victory because the Americans had suffered so many casualties that they were now outnumbered and forced to withdraw. There were over 1,500 casualties including 258 killed.\n\n==Background==\nOn 3 July 1814 an American army under Major General [[Jacob Brown]] launched an attack across the [[Niagara River]] near its source on [[Lake Erie]]. His force quickly [[Capture of Fort Erie|captured]] the British position at [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] and then advanced north. Two days later one of his two brigades of regular U.S. Infantry under Brigadier General [[Winfield Scott]] defeated a British force commanded by Major General [[Phineas Riall]] at the [[Battle of Chippawa]].\n\nA few days after the battle Brown [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] the British defences along the [[Welland River|Chippawa River]] and the British fell back to [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] near the mouth of the Niagara on [[Lake Ontario]]. Brown lacked the necessary troops and heavy artillery to attack this position. At the time a British naval squadron controlled the lake. Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]], commander of the American ships based at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]], was waiting for new frigates and heavily armed brigs to be completed before he could challenge the British squadron. When these were finally ready to sail, the American squadron was further delayed in port when Chauncey fell ill. As a result, no reinforcements or heavy guns could be sent to Brown while the British were able to move several units across the lake from [[Toronto, Ontario|York]] to reinforce Fort George.<ref name=Graves104>Graves (1997), p. 104.</ref>\n\nFor most of July, Brown's army occupied [[Queenston, Ontario|Queenston]] a few miles south of Fort George. In this forward position they were harassed by Canadian militia and [[First Nation]]s. On 24 July Brown fell back to the Chippawa River intending to secure his supplies before advancing west to [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]].<ref name=Graves104/> As soon as Brown retired, British light infantry and militia under Major General Riall advanced to Lundy's Lane {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of the Chippawa to allow light troops to maintain contact with the American main force.<ref>Graves (1999), p. 107.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n===Preliminary movements===\nEarly on 25 July, the British [[List of lieutenant governors of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Upper Canada]], Lieutenant General [[Gordon Drummond]], arrived in Fort George to take personal command on the Niagara peninsula. He immediately ordered a force under Lieutenant Colonel John Tucker to advance south from [[Fort Niagara]] (which the British had captured in December 1813) along the east side of the Niagara River, hoping this would force Brown to evacuate the west bank.<ref>Elting (1995), p. 190.</ref> Instead, Brown ordered an advance north, intending in turn to force the British to recall Tucker's column to protect Fort George. The Americans apparently did not know that the British held Lundy's Lane in strength.\n[[File:Gordon Drummond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The order to retreat to [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] was countermanded by Lieutenant General [[Gordon Drummond]], who instead ordered for reinforcements to support his position at Lundy's Lane.]]\nAs soon as Riall knew the Americans were advancing, he ordered his troops to fall back to Fort George and ordered another column under Colonel [[Hercules Scott]] to move from St. Davids to Queenston to cover his withdrawal, rather than advance to his support. These orders were countermanded by Drummond, who had force-marched a detachment of reinforcements to Lundy's Lane from Fort George. The British were still reoccupying their positions when the first American units came into view, at about 6:00&nbsp;pm.<ref>Elting (1995), p. 191.</ref>\n\n===Scott's attack===\nLundy's Lane was a spur from the main portage road alongside the Niagara River. It ran along the summit of some rising ground (about 25 feet higher than the surrounding area) and therefore commanded good views of the area. The British artillery (two 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns, one 5.5-inch [[howitzer]] and a [[Congreve rocket]] detachment) were massed in a cemetery at the highest point of the battlefield.\n\nThe American 1st Brigade of regulars under Winfield Scott emerged in the late afternoon from a forest into an open field and was badly mauled by the British artillery.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 129\u2013131.</ref> Scott sent the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th U.S. Infantry]], commanded by Major [[Thomas Jesup]], to outflank the British left. The 25th found a disused track leading to a landing stage on the river and used it to pass round the British flank. They caught the British and Canadian units there (the light company of the 1st Battalion of the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th (King's) Regiment]] and the [[Canadian Units of the War of 1812#Full-time militia|Upper Canada Incorporated Militia Battalion]]) while they were redeploying and unaware of the American presence, and drove them back in confusion. The British and Canadians rallied, but had been driven off the Portage Road. Jesup sent Captain Ketchum's light infantry company to secure the junction of Lundy's Lane and the Portage Road. Ketchum's company captured large numbers of wounded and messengers, including Major General Riall who had been wounded in one arm and was riding to the rear. Most of the prisoners escaped when Ketchum himself, having briefly rejoined Jesup, ran into an enemy unit while trying to return to the main body of the American army, although Riall and militia cavalry leader Captain [[William Hamilton Merritt]] remained prisoners.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 138\u2013141.</ref>\n\nJesup's action and the steadiness of Scott's brigade nevertheless persuaded Drummond to withdraw his centre to maintain alignment with his left flank, and also pull back the [[Glengarry Light Infantry]], who had been harassing Scott's own left flank. The withdrawal of Drummond's center-left the artillery exposed in front of the infantry.<ref name=Graves145>Graves (1997), p. 145.</ref>\n\n===Brown's attack===\n[[File:AR Miller James.jpg|upright|thumb|After he was instructed to take British guns, Lt Col [[James Miller (general)|James Miller]], commander of the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st U.S. Infantry]], responded ''\"I'll try, Sir.\"'']]\nBy nightfall, Scott's brigade had suffered heavy casualties, but Brown had arrived with the American main body (the 2nd Brigade of regulars under Brigadier General [[Eleazer Wheelock Ripley]] and a brigade of volunteers from the militia under Brigadier General [[Peter B. Porter]]). As Ripley and Porter relieved Scott's brigade, Brown ordered the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st U.S. Infantry]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[James Miller (general)|James Miller]] to capture the British guns. Miller famously responded, ''\"I'll try, Sir\"''.<ref name=Elting193>Elting (1995), p.193</ref>\n\nWhile the British were distracted by another attack by the 1st U.S. Infantry on their right, Miller's troops deployed within a few yards of the British artillery. They fired a volley of [[musket]]ry which killed most of the gunners and followed up with a [[bayonet]] charge which captured the guns and drove the British centre from the hill. The British infantry immediately behind the guns (the 2nd Battalion of the [[89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot|89th Foot]]) tried to counter-attack, but were driven back by Miller and Ripley.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, the British column under Colonel Hercules Scott was arriving on the field, already tired from its unnecessary diversion via Queenston. Unaware of the changed situation, they blundered into Ripley's brigade and were also driven back in disorder, losing their own three 6-pounder guns. These were recovered by a charge by the light company of the [[41st Regiment of Foot|41st Foot]], but were either abandoned again<ref name=Graves145/> or remained in British hands but could not be brought into action as the drivers and gunners had been scattered.<ref name=Elting195>Elting (1995), p. 195.</ref>\n\n===Drummond's counter-attack===\nWhile the Americans tried to deploy their own artillery among the captured British guns, Drummond (who had been wounded in the neck) reorganized his troops and mounted a determined attempt to retake his own cannon. There was no subtlety; Drummond merely launched an attack in line, without attempting to use his many light infantry to harass or disorder the American line,<ref>Graves (1997), p. 167.</ref> or to locate any weak points in it. The attack was beaten back after a short-range musketry duel over the abandoned British guns, in which both sides suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 170\u2013171.</ref> The [[Glengarry Light Infantry]], who had once again begun to harass the American left flank, were mistaken for Americans by other British units and forced to withdraw after suffering casualties from British fire.\n[[File:Battle of Niagara Falls map.jpg|thumb|left|A map from 1869 that shows the positions of the American and British forces during the battle.]]\nUndeterred by his first failure, Drummond launched a second attack, using the same methods and formation as in the first. Although some American units wavered, they were rallied by Ripley and stood their ground.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 174.</ref> While the combat was taking place, Winfield Scott led his depleted brigade (which had been reorganized into a single ad-hoc battalion under Major [[Henry Leavenworth]]) in an unauthorized attack against Drummond's centre. Scott's brigade was engaged both by the British and by units of Ripley's brigade, who were not aware of the identity of the troops at which they were shooting. Drummond's line was driven back but Scott's men broke in disorder and retreated, before rallying on the American left.<ref>Elting (1995), p. 194.</ref> Scott rode off to join Jesup's regiment, still out on the right flank, but was severely wounded shortly afterwards.\n\nShortly before midnight, Drummond launched a third counter-attack, using every man he could find,<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 180\u2013181.</ref> although by this time the British line consisted of mixed-up detachments and companies, rather than organised regiments and battalions. The fighting over the artillery was even closer than before, with bayonets being used at one point, but again the exhausted British fell back.\n\n===End of the battle===\nBy midnight both sides were spent. On the American side only 700 men were still standing in the line. Winfield Scott and Jacob Brown were both severely wounded. Brown would soon recover but Scott's injury removed him from the campaign. With supplies and water short, Brown ordered a retreat. Porter and Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Hindman (Brown's artillery commander) protested but complied. Ripley was apparently left unaware of Brown's order until he realised that Hindman's artillery had been withdrawn.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> Although urged by Porter to maintain his position, he also withdrew.<ref name=Elting195/> The British still had 1,400 men on the field but they were in no condition to interfere with the American withdrawal. Drummond had ordered some units to hold the Portage Road and left some light infantry outposts near the Americans, but had withdrawn the remainder a short distance west along Lundy's Lane.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 187.</ref>\n\nThe American artillerymen had suffered severely during the fighting and Hindman had difficulty finding sufficient draught horses to get all his guns away. One American 6-pounder gun had been lost earlier during the close-range fighting when its drivers had been hit by musket fire and the horses drawing it had bolted into the British lines.<ref name=Elting193/> Hindman also had to abandon a howitzer with a broken carriage. However, the Americans were able to drag away one captured 6-pounder gun which had earlier been pushed to the bottom of the high ground in the centre of the former British position.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 183.</ref> Hindman later found some more horses and sent a team back to recover one of the prized British 24-pounder guns. The team was captured by British parties who were wandering around the battlefield.<ref>Graves (1997), p. 185.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map of the Niagara Frontier, 1869.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the Niagara Frontier in 1814. Following Lundy's Lane, American forces fell back to [[Old Fort Erie|Fort Erie]], losing the initiative on the [[Niagara Peninsula]].]]\nIn the early hours of the morning of 26 July, Brown ordered Ripley to recover the abandoned British guns the next day. Reinforcing his exhausted men with detachments which had been left at Chippawa, Ripley moved out at daybreak with 1,200 soldiers but found that Drummond had reoccupied the battlefield with 2,200 men.<ref name=Elting196>Elting (1995), p. 196.</ref> Ripley withdrew, unmolested. The American army fell back to Fort Erie, first deliberately destroying the old British fortifications along the Chippawa River and burning the bridges behind them. Because they were short of transport, they had to abandon or destroy much equipment and supplies to make room for the wounded on the available wagons. Drummond was later to claim from this that the Americans had retreated in disorder. After burying some of the British and Canadian dead on the battlefield and burning many American corpses in large funeral pyres, the British had themselves withdrawn to Queenston until Drummond received reinforcements.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn respect to the effect of the battle on the War, the British won a strategic victory, since the Americans on the Niagara had suffered so many casualties that they were now badly outnumbered, and were forced to retire to Fort Erie. Richard V. Barbuto says, \"On 26 July, Brown's plan to advance on Burlington Heights was irretrievably shattered... Drummond had secured the forts at the northern end of the Niagara, and he had blunted an American advance. Although there was still a lot of fight in both forces, the balance of combat power on the Niagara Peninsula had swung from the invaders to the defenders\".<ref name=\"Barbuto229\">Barbuto, p. 229</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\nThe British official casualty return had 84 killed, 559 wounded, 42 captured and 193 missing.<ref name=Graves1993173/> The Americans captured 19 British officers and 150 other ranks, giving a revised British casualty total of 84 killed, 559 wounded, 169 captured and 55 missing.<ref name=Graves1993174/>\n\nThe original American official casualty return, dated 30 July 1814, gave 171 dead, 572 wounded and 117 missing.<ref>Cruikshank, p. 421.</ref> A slightly later version gave the same number of killed and wounded but only 110 missing.<ref name=\"Wood164\"/> Donald Graves says, \"British records state that four officers and 75 Americans of other ranks captured at Lundy's Lane were imprisoned at Quebec in the autumn of 1814. The remainder of the missing were probably the wounded or dead left on the field after Ripley withdrew\".<ref name=\"Graves1993175\"/> Three officers of the 22nd U.S. Regiment of Infantry; Lieutenants William Sturgis, John D. Kehr and Robert M. Davidson, who appear on the casualty list as \"missing\" and \"supposed to be killed\"<ref>Cruikshank, p. 423.</ref> were later confirmed as having been killed on 25 July.<ref name=\"Whitehorne149-150\"/> This gives a revised American loss of 174 killed, 572 wounded, 79 captured and 28 missing. Graves speculates that the discrepancies in the proportions of killed and wounded men between British and American casualties may be accounted for by the Americans not collating their casualty returns until five days after the battle, when some of those originally listed as missing were confirmed to have been killed, and some severely wounded men had died of their wounds.<ref>Graves (1997), pp. 197\u2013198.</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nThere had been much fighting at close quarters. Veteran British officers, who had fought against French armies in the [[Peninsular War]], were horrified at the carnage they had witnessed at Lundy's Lane. Drummond reported, ''\"Of so determined a Character were'' <nowiki>[the American]</nowiki> ''attacks directed against our guns that our Artillery Men were bayonetted by the enemy in the Act of loading, and the muzzles of the Enemy's Guns were advanced within a few Yards of ours\"''. The battle confirmed that the American regular forces had evolved into a highly professional army. Scott is widely credited for this progress, having modelled and trained his troops using [[French Revolutionary Army]] drills and exercises, although not all the American units present at Lundy's Lane had benefitted from his personal training.<ref>Elting (1995), pp. 179\u2013180.</ref>\n\nEvidence compiled by [[Donald Graves]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] historian employed at the Directorate of History, Department of National Defence Canada, argues that General Drummond failed to use skirmish pickets to protect his guns, which were consequently captured by the Americans. Drummond also showed little tactical finesse during his counter-attacks, not using his light infantry to their best advantage and mounting only straightforward frontal attacks. American historian John R. Elting suggests that if Drummond had instead concentrated on the vulnerable American left flank, he might have won a decisive victory.<ref name=Elting196/> (Drummond had much administrative experience, but had previously seen action only in the abortive [[Flanders Campaign]] in 1794 as a comparatively junior officer, and in the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian campaign]] in 1801 as commander of a battalion.)\n\n==Battlefield and memorials==\n[[File:Lundy's Lane Historical Museum.jpg|upright|thumb|Lundy's Lane Historical Museum in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, on Lundy's Lane near the battle site.]]\nThe site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1937.<ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0435&oqeName=Battle+of+Lundy%27%27s+Lane&oqfName=Bataille+de+la+ruelle+de+Lundy Battle of Lundy's Lane]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada.</ref><ref>{{CRHP|12081|Battle of Lundy's Lane|16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe site of the battle is now a residential and commercial area of Niagara Falls, Ontario.

Thirteen major operations were conducted by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) between 29 April and 22 July and by U.S. forces between 1 May and 30 June.\n\nThe objective of the campaign was the defeat of the approximately 40,000 troops of the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where PAVN/VC forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of [[Vietnamization]] and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.\n\nA change in the Cambodian government allowed an opportunity to destroy the bases in 1970, when Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] was deposed and replaced by pro-U.S. General [[Lon Nol]]. A series of South Vietnamese-[[Khmer Republic]] operations captured several towns, but the PAVN/VC military and political leadership narrowly escaped the cordon. The operation was partly a response to a PAVN offensive on 29 March against the Cambodian Army that captured large parts of eastern Cambodia in the wake of these operations. Allied military operations failed to eliminate many PAVN/VC troops or to capture their elusive headquarters, known as the [[Central Office for South Vietnam]] (COSVN) as they had left a month prior, but the haul of captured material in Cambodia prompted claims of success.\n\n==Preliminaries==\n\n===Background===\n{{details|topic=history of Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u201370)}}{{details|topic=the PAVN logistical system|Sihanouk Trail}}\nThe PAVN had been utilizing large sections of relatively unpopulated eastern [[Cambodia]] as sanctuaries into which they could withdraw from the struggle in [[South Vietnam]] to rest and reorganize without being attacked. These base areas were also utilized by the PAVN and VC to store weapons and other material that had been transported on a large scale into the region on the [[Sihanouk Trail]]. PAVN forces had begun moving through Cambodian territory as early as 1963. Cambodian neutrality had already been violated by South Vietnamese forces in pursuit of political-military factions opposed to the regime of [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=Isaacs>{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Arnold|last2=Hardy|first2=Gordon|title=The Vietnam Experience Pawns of War: Cambodia and Laos|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1987|isbn=9780939526246|page=[https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/54 54]|url=https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/54}}</ref> In 1966, Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], ruler of Cambodia, convinced of eventual communist victory in Southeast Asia and fearful for the future of his rule, had concluded an agreement with the [[People's Republic of China]] which allowed the establishment of permanent communist bases on Cambodian soil and the use of the Cambodian port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] for resupply.<ref name=Lipsman>{{cite book|last1=Lipsman|first1=Samuel|last2=Doyle|first2=Edward|title=The Vietnam Experience Fighting for Time|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1983|isbn=978-0939526079|url=https://archive.org/details/fightingfortime00lips/page/127}}</ref>{{rp|127}}<ref name=Pribbenow>{{cite book|last=Pribbenow|first=Merle|title=Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954-1975 (Modern War Studies)|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2002|isbn=9780700621873|page=465}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mao Sihanouk.jpg|thumb|Meeting in Beijing: [[Mao Zedong]] (l), [[Prince Sihanouk]] (c), and [[Liu Shaoqi]] (r)]]\nDuring 1968, Cambodia's indigenous communist movement, labeled [[Khmer Rouge]] (Red Khmers) by Sihanouk, began an insurgency to overthrow the government.

This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, most of whom were concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions.<ref name=Stanton>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Shelby|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army: U.S. Ground Forces in Vietnam, 1963\u20131973|publisher=Dell|year=1985|isbn=9780891418276}}</ref>{{rp|319-20}}\n\nOn 22 April Nixon authorized the planning of a South Vietnamese incursion into the [[Parrot's Beak, Cambodia|Parrot's Beak]] (named for its perceived shape on a map), believing that \"Giving the South Vietnamese an operation of their own would be a major boost to their morale as well as provide a practical demonstration of the success of Vietnamization.\"<ref name=Lipsman/>{{rp|149}} On the following day, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William P.

A preliminary operational plan had actually been completed in March, but was kept so tightly under wraps that when Abrams handed over the task to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant general]] [[Michael S.

The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of Nixon, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the [[US Embassy, Saigon]], the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists.

Once again, the need for security before the operations and the rapidity with which units were transferred to the border regions precluded detailed planning and preparation.

The tempo of logistical troops could be mind numbing. The U.S. Third Ordnance Battalion for example, loaded up to 150 flatbed trucks per day with ammunition. Logisticians were issuing more than 2,300 short tons (almost five million pounds) of supplies every day to support the incursion.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|135}} Aerial resupply, therefore, became the chief method of logistical replenishment for the forward units.

The logistical haul discovered, removed, or destroyed in eastern Cambodia during the operations was indeed prodigious: 22,892 individual and 2,509 crew-served weapons; 7,000 to 8,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of ammunition (including 143,000 mortar shells, rockets and recoilless rifle rounds); 29 tons of communications equipment; 431 vehicles; and 55 tons of medical supplies.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|162}}<ref name=Tran/>{{rp|193}} MACV intelligence estimated that PAVN/VC forces in southern Vietnam required 1,222 tons of all supplies each month to keep up a normal pace of operations.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|163}} \n\nDue to the loss of its Cambodian supply system and continued aerial interdiction in Laos, MACV estimated that for every 2.5 tons of materiel sent south down the Ho Chi Minh trail, only one ton reached its destination. However, the true loss rate was probably only around ten percent. Due to lack of verifiable sources in North Vietnam, this figure is, at best, an estimate. The official Vietnamese history noted: {{quote|[T]he enemy had established control over and successfully suppressed, to some extent at least, our nighttime supply operations. Enemy aircraft destroyed 4,000 trucks during the 1970\u20131971 dry season...

Per the same history, {{quote|[I]n 1969 Group 559 shipped 20 thousand tons of supplies to the battlefields, in 1970 this total rose to 40 thousand tons and in 1971 it increased to 60 thousand tons... losses along the way in 1969, which were 13.5 percent, declined to 3.4 percent in 1970 and 2.7 percent in 1971.<ref name=Merle6263>''Victory in Vietnam'', trans.

Tr\u00ed proved a resourceful and inspiring commander, earning the sobriquet the \"Patton of the Parrot's Beak\" from the American media.

Other ARVN commanders, however, had not performed as well. Even at this late date in the conflict, the appointment of ARVN general officers was prompted by political loyalty rather than professional competence. As a test of Vietnamization, the incursion was praised by American generals and politicians alike, but the Vietnamese had not really performed alone. The participation of U.S. ground and air forces had precluded any such claim.

Thirteen major operations were conducted by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) between 29 April and 22 July and by U.S. forces between 1 May and 30 June.\n\nThe objective of the campaign was the defeat of the approximately 40,000 troops of the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where PAVN/VC forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of [[Vietnamization]] and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.\n\nA change in the Cambodian government allowed an opportunity to destroy the bases in 1970, when Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] was deposed and replaced by pro-U.S. General [[Lon Nol]]. A series of South Vietnamese-[[Khmer Republic]] operations captured several towns, but the PAVN/VC military and political leadership narrowly escaped the cordon. The operation was partly a response to a PAVN offensive on 29 March against the Cambodian Army that captured large parts of eastern Cambodia in the wake of these operations. Allied military operations failed to eliminate many PAVN/VC troops or to capture their elusive headquarters, known as the [[Central Office for South Vietnam]] (COSVN) as they had left a month prior, but the haul of captured material in Cambodia prompted claims of success.\n\n==Preliminaries==\n\n===Background===\n{{details|topic=history of Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u201370)}}{{details|topic=the PAVN logistical system|Sihanouk Trail}}\nThe PAVN had been utilizing large sections of relatively unpopulated eastern [[Cambodia]] as sanctuaries into which they could withdraw from the struggle in [[South Vietnam]] to rest and reorganize without being attacked. These base areas were also utilized by the PAVN and VC to store weapons and other material that had been transported on a large scale into the region on the [[Sihanouk Trail]]. PAVN forces had begun moving through Cambodian territory as early as 1963. Cambodian neutrality had already been violated by South Vietnamese forces in pursuit of political-military factions opposed to the regime of [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=Isaacs>{{cite book|last1=Isaacs|first1=Arnold|last2=Hardy|first2=Gordon|title=The Vietnam Experience Pawns of War: Cambodia and Laos|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1987|isbn=9780939526246|page=[https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/54 54]|url=https://archive.org/details/pawnsofwarcambod00isaa/page/54}}</ref> In 1966, Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], ruler of Cambodia, convinced of eventual communist victory in Southeast Asia and fearful for the future of his rule, had concluded an agreement with the [[People's Republic of China]] which allowed the establishment of permanent communist bases on Cambodian soil and the use of the Cambodian port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] for resupply.<ref name=Lipsman>{{cite book|last1=Lipsman|first1=Samuel|last2=Doyle|first2=Edward|title=The Vietnam Experience Fighting for Time|publisher=Boston Publishing Company|year=1983|isbn=978-0939526079|url=https://archive.org/details/fightingfortime00lips/page/127}}</ref>{{rp|127}}<ref name=Pribbenow>{{cite book|last=Pribbenow|first=Merle|title=Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954-1975 (Modern War Studies)|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2002|isbn=9780700621873|page=465}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mao Sihanouk.jpg|thumb|Meeting in Beijing: [[Mao Zedong]] (l), [[Prince Sihanouk]] (c), and [[Liu Shaoqi]] (r)]]\nDuring 1968, Cambodia's indigenous communist movement, labeled [[Khmer Rouge]] (Red Khmers) by Sihanouk, began an insurgency to overthrow the government.

This was followed by an hour of massed artillery fire and another hour of strikes by tactical fighter-bombers. At 10:00, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] (11th ACR), the ARVN 1st Armored Cavalry Regiment and the ARVN 3rd Airborne Brigade then entered [[Kampong Cham Province]]. Known as ''Task Force Shoemaker'' (after General [[Robert M. Shoemaker]], the Assistant Division Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division), the force attacked the PAVN/VC stronghold with 10,000 U.S. and 5,000 South Vietnamese troops. The operation utilized mechanized infantry and armored units to drive deep into the province where they would then link up with ARVN airborne and U.S. airmobile units that had been lifted in by helicopter.<ref name=Lipsman/>{{rp|164}}<ref name=Tran/>{{rp|70-3}}\n\nOpposition to the incursion was expected to be heavy, but PAVN/VC forces had begun moving westward two days before the advance began.

A 4,000-man ARVN armored task force linked up with FANK troops and then retook the town.

Once again, the need for security before the operations and the rapidity with which units were transferred to the border regions precluded detailed planning and preparation. Abrams was fortunate, had the PAVN/VC fought for the sanctuaries instead of fleeing, U.S. and ARVN units would have rapidly consumed their available supplies.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|136}} This situation was exacerbated by the poor road network in the border regions and the possibility of ambush for nighttime road convoys demanded that deliveries only take place during daylight. The tempo of logistical troops could be mind numbing. The U.S. Third Ordnance Battalion for example, loaded up to 150 flatbed trucks per day with ammunition. Logisticians were issuing more than 2,300 short tons (almost five million pounds) of supplies every day to support the incursion.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|135}} Aerial resupply, therefore, became the chief method of logistical replenishment for the forward units. Military engineers and aviators were kept in constant motion throughout the incursion zone.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|96\u2013101}}\n\nDue to the rapid pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, coordination of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|72\u20133}} This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated by the lack of adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|149\u201351}} Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, and spare parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{details|topic=the expansion of the PAVN logistical system|Ho Chi Minh trail}}\n[[File:Areas of Cambodia under government control August 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Areas under PAVN/VC/Khmer Rouge control by August 1970]]\nThe North Vietnamese response to the incursion was to avoid contact with allied forces and, if possible, to fall back westward and regroup.

On 4 May the unrest escalated to violence when [[Ohio Army National Guard|Ohio National Guardsmen]] shot and killed four unarmed students (two of whom were not protesters) during the [[Kent State shootings]]. Two days later, at the [[University at Buffalo]], police wounded four more demonstrators.

A \"decent interval\" had been obtained for the final American withdrawal. ARVN General Tran Dinh Tho was more skeptical: {{quote|[D]espite its spectacular results...it must be recognized that the Cambodian incursion proved, in the long run, to pose little more than a temporary disruption of North Vietnam's march toward domination of all of Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam.<ref name=Tran/>}}\n\nJohn Shaw and other historians, military and civilian, have based the conclusions of their work on the incursion on the premise that the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|161\u2013170}}<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|324\u20135}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Dave|title=Summons of the Trumpet: U.S.-Vietnam in perspective|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1978|isbn=9780891410416|pages=[https://archive.org/details/summonsoftrumpet00palm/page/300 300\u20131]|url=https://archive.org/details/summonsoftrumpet00palm/page/300}}</ref> However this was only temporary as shown by the sustained PAVN [[Battle of An Loc|attacks on An Loc]] supported out of Cambodia during the 1972 [[Easter Offensive]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ngo|first=Quang Truong|title=The Easter Offensive of 1972|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|year=1980|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a324505.pdf|isbn=|pages=130\u20135}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n[[File:Camborice.jpg|thumb|right|Cambodian civilians bag up captured North Vietnamese rice.]]\nThe U.S. and ARVN claimed 11,369 PAVN/VC soldiers killed and 2,509 captured. The logistical haul discovered, removed, or destroyed in eastern Cambodia during the operations was indeed prodigious: 22,892 individual and 2,509 crew-served weapons; 7,000 to 8,000 tons of rice; 1,800 tons of ammunition (including 143,000 mortar shells, rockets and recoilless rifle rounds); 29 tons of communications equipment; 431 vehicles; and 55 tons of medical supplies.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|162}}<ref name=Tran/>{{rp|193}} MACV intelligence estimated that PAVN/VC forces in southern Vietnam required 1,222 tons of all supplies each month to keep up a normal pace of operations.<ref name=Shaw/>{{rp|163}} \n\nDue to the loss of its Cambodian supply system and continued aerial interdiction in Laos, MACV estimated that for every 2.5 tons of materiel sent south down the Ho Chi Minh trail, only one ton reached its destination. However, the true loss rate was probably only around ten percent. Due to lack of verifiable sources in North Vietnam, this figure is, at best, an estimate. The official Vietnamese history noted: {{quote|[T]he enemy had established control over and successfully suppressed, to some extent at least, our nighttime supply operations. Enemy aircraft destroyed 4,000 trucks during the 1970\u20131971 dry season... Our supply effort, conducted during a single season of the year and using a single supply route, was unable to keep up with our requirements and our night supply operations encountered difficulties.<ref name=Merle6263/>}} Regardless, the PAVN's [[Group 559]] successfully countered these efforts through camouflage tactics and the construction of thousands of kilometers of \"bypass\" roads to avoid choke points that frequently came under enemy attack. Per the same history, {{quote|[I]n 1969 Group 559 shipped 20 thousand tons of supplies to the battlefields, in 1970 this total rose to 40 thousand tons and in 1971 it increased to 60 thousand tons... losses along the way in 1969, which were 13.5 percent, declined to 3.4 percent in 1970 and 2.7 percent in 1971.<ref name=Merle6263>''Victory in Vietnam'', trans.

Tr\u00ed proved a resourceful and inspiring commander, earning the sobriquet the \"Patton of the Parrot's Beak\" from the American media. Abrams also praised the skill of General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Vi\u1ebft Thanh]], commander of IV Corps and planner of the Parrot's Beak operation.<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|221}} Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, both officers were killed in helicopter crashes, Thanh on 2 May in Cambodia and Tr\u00ed in February 1971. Other ARVN commanders, however, had not performed as well. Even at this late date in the conflict, the appointment of ARVN general officers was prompted by political loyalty rather than professional competence. As a test of Vietnamization, the incursion was praised by American generals and politicians alike, but the Vietnamese had not really performed alone. The participation of U.S. ground and air forces had precluded any such claim. When called on to conduct solo offensive operations during the incursion into Laos ([[Operation Lam Son 719]]) in 1971, the ARVN's continued weaknesses would become all too apparent.<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|337}}\n\nThe Cambodian government was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. The Cambodian leadership however welcomed the intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN military capabilities. The leadership had hoped for permanent U.S. occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following U.S. withdrawal and instead the PAVN and Khmer Rouge moved quickly to fill the void.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|173\u20134}} It has been argued that the incursion heated up the civil war and helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.<ref name=Tran/>{{rp|166-7}}<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|173\u20134}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Shawcross|first=William|title=Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia|publisher=Washington Square Books|year=1979|isbn=9780815412243|page=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*[http://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1969-76v07/pdf/frus1969-76v07.pdf ''VIETNAM, JULY 1970\u2013JANUARY 1972'']\n*[http://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1969-76v06/pdf/frus1969-76v06.pdf ''VIETNAM, JANUARY 1969\u2013JULY 1970'']\n*[https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a955417.pdf ''MACV Command History 1970 Volume III'']\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n[[Category:1970 in Cambodia]]\n[[Category:Cambodia\u2013United States relations]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1970]]\n[[Category:Invasions by the United States]]\n[[Category:Invasions of Cambodia]]\n[[Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1970]]\n[[Category:April 1970 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:May 1970 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:June 1970 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:July 1970 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Choppers o'er Nam", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Fishhook - Operations Toan Thang 43-6/Rock Crusher", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_campaign"}
