Two prevalent examples are \"sorry\" and \"sir.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The literal meaning of sorry usually indicates some sort of responsibility on the part of the person saying it; however, for all of the varieties of NE, it is used to express sympathy in a unique way, or to show empathy to whoever has experienced misfortune. \"Sir,\" or the replacement of names with titles, indicates respect and a high value for politeness. The tacking on of \"sir\" to another title (i.e. \"Professor sir\")<ref name=\":0\" /> illustrates a greater level of prestige than normal, or an instance of being more polite than the norm.\n\nThough the exact levels of Nigerian English usage are contested, one suggestion indicates there are 4 levels of usage within this nativized (but not indigenous) English:<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Okoro|first=Oko|date=Spring 2017|title=Nigerian English Usage and the Tyranny of Faulty Analogy III: Pronunciation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1388/e9f4b54b92bc5c6d4eb6d3fcff4b5303cae3.pdf|journal=California Linguistic Notes|volume=41|pages=26\u201362|via=University of Lagos}}</ref>\n\n*Level 1: Pidgin, spoken as the casual language\n*Level 2: A step above, and the most spoken.

Like [[South African English]], its [[nativization]] and development as a New World English corresponds roughly with the period of [[colonization]] and post-colonization by [[United Kingdom|Britain]].<ref>Lass, Roger. \"Language in South Africa.\" Chapter 5: South African English, Cambridge University Press, 2002, print.</ref> Nigerian English became a nativized language that functions uniquely within its own cultural context.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Adamo|first=Grace Ebunlola|date=February 2007|title=Nigerian English|url=https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0D6F31C9FDCB4300A42E31348C33A561/S0266078407001083a.pdf/nigerian_english.pdf|journal=English Today|volume=23|pages=42\u201347|doi=10.1017/S0266078407001083|via=CambridgeCore}}</ref>\n\nNigerian English has long been a controversial idea, in that the idea of a \"Standard Nigerian English\" (SNE) is difficult to establish,{{cn|date=March 2020}} considering the fossilization that has occurred in the formal instruction of English in many regions of Nigeria, due largely to a variety of factors including \"interference, lack of facilities, and crowded classrooms.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Okoro|first=Oko|date=Spring 2017|title=Nigerian English Usage and the Tyranny of Faulty Analogy III: Pronunciation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1388/e9f4b54b92bc5c6d4eb6d3fcff4b5303cae3.pdf|journal=California Linguistic Notes|volume=41|pages=26\u201362|via=University of Lagos}}</ref> Due to the contact between British Standard English and Nigerian English, which have two very different sets of grammatical, pronunciation, and spelling rules, there has arisen a predominant occurrence of \"faulty analogy\" (the assumption that because one grammatical feature resembles another in usage, the rules applying to the former also apply to the latter) in what Okoro refers to as \"substandard\" varieties of Nigerian English.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHowever, there are a few features that have united across NE communities that bridge the differences between different varieties even within NE, all pertaining to cultural values that are expressed uniquely in English terms. Two prevalent examples are \"sorry\" and \"sir.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The literal meaning of sorry usually indicates some sort of responsibility on the part of the person saying it; however, for all of the varieties of NE, it is used to express sympathy in a unique way, or to show empathy to whoever has experienced misfortune. \"Sir,\" or the replacement of names with titles, indicates respect and a high value for politeness. The tacking on of \"sir\" to another title (i.e. \"Professor sir\")<ref name=\":0\" /> illustrates a greater level of prestige than normal, or an instance of being more polite than the norm.\n\nThough the exact levels of Nigerian English usage are contested, one suggestion indicates there are 4 levels of usage within this nativized (but not indigenous) English:<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite journal|last=Okoro|first=Oko|date=Spring 2017|title=Nigerian English Usage and the Tyranny of Faulty Analogy III: Pronunciation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1388/e9f4b54b92bc5c6d4eb6d3fcff4b5303cae3.pdf|journal=California Linguistic Notes|volume=41|pages=26\u201362|via=University of Lagos}}</ref>\n\n*Level 1: Pidgin, spoken as the casual language\n*Level 2: A step above, and the most spoken.

This can cause the original English meanings to be \"shifted, restricted, or extended.\"<ref name=\":04\">{{Cite journal|last=Adamo|first=Grace Ebunlola|date=February 2007|title=Nigerian English|url=https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0D6F31C9FDCB4300A42E31348C33A561/S0266078407001083a.pdf/nigerian_english.pdf|journal=English Today|volume=23|pages=42\u201347|doi=10.1017/S0266078407001083|via=CambridgeCore}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in some areas, though the international meaning of trek has a connotation of long distance or difficult journey, the Nigerian use is to \"walk a short distance.\"<ref name=\":04\" />\n\nA particularly expansive example of semantics in NE is the use of a variety of greetings. This stretching of meaning can not only change the meaning of the English phrase, but also represent something from Nigerian culture: for example, the saying \"goodnight, ma\" can be said regardless of time of day, and functions simply as an assumption that the person in question will not be seen until the next day.<ref name=\":0\" /> This has especially been noticed in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] culture.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice|section}}\nAs the literature currently stands, most phonological studies have analyzed a plethora of Nigerian English speakers from a wide range of backgrounds (region of origin, current profession, social class, etc.). There has been special focus on such regions as Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Nigerian English can be thought of in a similar way to American English in this approach: just as in American English, Nigerian English varies from region to region, and as such, phonological variables are realized in different ways in different regions.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSome common features across Nigerian Englishes include:\n\n* Voiced -z sounds in which the \"s\" is present in spelling become voiceless, i.e. \"boys\" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|b|\u0254\u026a|s}}.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite

/\u026a/ vowels into /e/, exhibited in words such as \"expect\", pronounced /ek\u02c8spekt/ in NE.<ref name=\":22\" />\n* Because voiced palato-alveolar fricative /\u0292/ is not present in most Nigerian varieties, any words including this phoneme are converted into the -sh /\u0283/ sound, such as in the word \"conclusion\", pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|n|\u02c8|k|l|u\u02d0|\u0283|\u0259|n}} in NE.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Prosody ===\n\nEarly studies have associated Nigerian English with being syllable-timed rather than stress-timed, but the dialect has thus far evaded specific grouping in either category.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Prosody of Nigerian English|last=Gut, Milde|first=Ulrike, Jan-Torsten|publisher=University of
