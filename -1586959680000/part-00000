The squadrons equipped with the Cougar in those regiments were humorously referred to as the \"boat squadron\" as opposed to the reconnaissance squadrons, which were equipped with the Lynx, and later the Coyote (another AVGP successor).\n\nThe Grizzly was used as an armoured personnel carrier in regular force infantry battalions not equipped with the M113 APC, and also by reserve units. The majority of vehicles had their marine propulsion systems removed. Under the Wheeled LAV Life Extension project, the Canadian Forces planned to convert Grizzly and Husky vehicles to support variants, such as Command Post and Mobile Repair Team Vehicle.

A filtering system that sorts incoming, outgoing, read, and replied messages to folders; auto-responds; replies with custom templates; forwards, redirects, prints, or exports messages; sends read confirmations; runs external programs and more.\n*''Message Templates and Macros.'' Email templates contents may be dynamically changed through the use of macros, which can also be used to automatically execute other user-defined functions such as cursor positioning, addressing changes, identity changes, active account changes and other. \n*''Microsoft Exchange Connectivity.'' The Bat! connects to [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] using native [[MAPI]] protocol to fetch or send messages.\n*''Multilingual Interface.'' Support for 18 languages. \n*''IDN support.''

One plausible theory is that the word \"Tehran\" is derived from Tiran/Tirgan, \"The Abode of Tir\" (Tir being the Zoroastrian deity equivalent to the Greek deity Mercury). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran was a neighbour to the town of Mehran (\"The Abode of Mehr/Mithra\", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside the Greater Tehran, as is also Ray\u2014which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\nAnother theory is that Tehran means \"a warm place\", as opposed to \"a cool place\" (e.g. Shemiran)\u2014a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means \"warm mountain slope\" (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0645).\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end or bottom\" and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014literally, bottom of the mountain slope. Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0647).<ref>{{Cite web |author=Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008}}</ref> \n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Timeline of Tehran}}\n\nThe settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.<ref>{{Cite new |publisher=[[Press TV]] |url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |title=7,000-year-old human skeleton recovered in south Tehran |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Classical era ===\nTehran is situated within the historical region of [[Media (region)|Media]] ({{lang-peo|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfad}} {{transl|peo|M\u0101da}}) in northwestern Iran.

On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908. That followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Ali-Qoli Khan]] (Sardar Asad II) and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Mohammad Vali Khan]] (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909.

That followed a systematic demolition of several old buildings, including parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tekyeh Dowlat|Tekye Dowlat]], and [[Toopkhaneh|Tupkhane Square]], which were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the building of the [[Bank Melli Iran|National Bank]], the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office, and the Military Academy.\n\nThe changes in urban fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|Grand Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished to be replaced with wide straight avenues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaichian|first1=Mohammad|title=Town and Country in the Middle East: Iran and Egypt in the Transition to Globalization|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7391-2677-6|pages=95\u2013116}}</ref> As a result, the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts, located on major public spaces such as the bazaar.\n\nAs an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric.

These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran, but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]] named the ''[[White Revolution]]'', Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. In order to resolve the problem of [[social exclusion]], the first comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration.

The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].\n\nWith the start of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].\n\nThe unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly [[Dari language|Dari]]-speaking [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]], speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly [[Mesopotamian Arabic]]-speakers who are often of Iranian heritage.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|Religion in Iran}}\nThe majority of Tehranis are officially [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslims]], which has also been the state religion since the 16th-century [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid conversion]]. Other religious communities in the city include followers of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Sufism|Mystic]] branches of Islam, various [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations, [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]].\n\nThere are many religious centres scattered around the city, from old to newly built centres, including [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Mosques and madrasehs|mosques]], [[List of religious centres in Tehran#Churches|churches]], [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Synagogues|synagogues]], and [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Fire temples|Zoroastrian fire temples]].

One plausible theory is that the word \"Tehran\" is derived from Tiran/Tirgan, \"The Abode of Tir\" (Tir being the Zoroastrian deity equivalent to the Greek deity Mercury). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran was a neighbour to the town of Mehran (\"The Abode of Mehr/Mithra\", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside the Greater Tehran, as is also Ray\u2014which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\nAnother theory is that Tehran means \"a warm place\", as opposed to \"a cool place\" (e.g. Shemiran)\u2014a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means \"warm mountain slope\" (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0645).\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end or bottom\" and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014literally, bottom of the mountain slope. Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0647).<ref>{{Cite web |author=Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008}}</ref> \n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Timeline of Tehran}}\n\nThe settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.<ref>{{Cite new |publisher=[[Press TV]] |url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |title=7,000-year-old human skeleton recovered in south Tehran |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Classical era ===\nTehran is situated within the historical region of [[Media (region)|Media]] ({{lang-peo|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfad}} {{transl|peo|M\u0101da}}) in northwestern Iran.

The 1878 plan of Tehran included new city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19 square kilometres, which mimicked the [[Renaissance]] cities of Europe.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://jph.sagepub.com/content/12/1/49|author=Vahdat Za, Vahid.|title=Spatial Discrimination in Tehran's Modern Urban Planning 1906\u20131979|year=2011|work=Journal of Planning History vol. 12 no. 1 49\u201362|accessdate=2013-04-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://jph.sagepub.com/content/12/1/49|archivedate=2015-10-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Late modern era ===\n[[File:Poster of Conquest of Tehran in July 1909 by Bakhtiaris.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Triumph of Tehran]]: [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Sardar Asad II]] and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni]] conquering Tehran in July 1909]]\nThe growing social awareness of civil rights resulted in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] and the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|first constitution of Iran]] in 1906. On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908. That followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Ali-Qoli Khan]] (Sardar Asad II) and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Mohammad Vali Khan]] (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced with his son [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmad]], and the parliament was re-established.\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Teheran aus 400 m H\u00f6he-Persienflug 1924-1925-LBS MH02-02-0085-AL-FL.tif|250px|thumb|Aerial view of Tehran in 1925]]\nAfter [[World War I]], the constituent assembly elected [[Reza Shah]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] as the new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches of governance and planning.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was essentially rebuilt from scratch. That followed a systematic demolition of several old buildings, including parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tekyeh Dowlat|Tekye Dowlat]], and [[Toopkhaneh|Tupkhane Square]], which were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the building of the [[Bank Melli Iran|National Bank]], the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office, and the Military Academy.\n\nThe changes in urban fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|Grand Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished to be replaced with wide straight avenues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaichian|first1=Mohammad|title=Town and Country in the Middle East: Iran and Egypt in the Transition to Globalization|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7391-2677-6|pages=95\u2013116}}</ref> As a result, the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts, located on major public spaces such as the bazaar.\n\nAs an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] troops entered the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]], attended by U.S. President [[Franklin D.

These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran, but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]] named the ''[[White Revolution]]'', Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. In order to resolve the problem of [[social exclusion]], the first comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the [[1979 Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[File:Tehran's Azadi Tower at night.jpeg|thumb|The [[Azadi Tower]] was built in 1971.]]\nTehran's most famous landmark, the [[Azadi Tower]], was built by the order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by [[Hossein Amanat]], an architect who won a competition to design the monument, combining elements of classical [[Sasanian architecture|Sassanian architecture]] with post-classical Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the ''Shahyad Tower'', it was built in commemoration of the [[2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran]].\n\nDuring the 1980\u20131988 Iran\u2013Iraq War, Tehran was the target of repeated [[Scud]] missile attacks and airstrikes.\n\nThe 435-meter-high [[Milad Tower]], which was part of the proposed development projects in pre-revolutionary Iran,<ref name=SadCity>{{cite web|last=Vanstiphout|first=Wouter|title=The Saddest City in the World|url=http://www.thenewtown.nl/article.php?id_article=71|work=The New Town|accessdate=1 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219102023/http://www.thenewtown.nl/article.php?id_article=71|archivedate=19 December 2013}}</ref> was completed in 2007, and has thence become a famous landmark of Tehran.

Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Alborz]] mountains to its north and the country's central desert to the south. It can be generally described as mild in spring and autumn, hot and dry in summer, and cold and wet in winter.\n\n[[File:A fall in Nation Park, Tehran City.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Mellat Park]] in autumn.]]\nAs the city has a large area, with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran.

After the political, social, and economic consequences of the [[1979 Revolution]] and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].\n\nWith the start of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].\n\nThe unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries.

The most noticeable changes were the transfer of the Ford emblem from the tip of the bonnet to the grille and a full-length applique bridging the gap between the tail lights, featuring [[reversing light|reversing lamps]] on both sides of the rear number plate. Additionally, the [[pillar (car)|C-pillar]] air vents were removed.<ref name = FalconFactsEB>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/falcon-fairmont/eb-falcon-1991-1993/ | title = EB Falcon (1991\u20131993) | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> The return of the [[V8 engine]] since its demise in the [[Ford Falcon (XE)]] of 1982 was welcomed by the motoring press, but the 5.0-litre [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] unit did not reappear in the utility variants until the \"[[Ford Falcon (EF)|EF]]-shaped\" [[Ford Falcon (XH)|XH series]] of 1996.

The update reportedly cost {{AUD|1&nbsp;million}}.<ref name = FalconFactsEB/>\n\nInnovation became an evident strength in the EB II: [[antilock brakes]] became an option, a Falcon first, and in 1993, a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard.<ref name = FalconFactsEB/> The EB also introduced the \"Smartlock\" security locking system. [[South Australian Police]] revealed the operational success of \"Smartlock\" by inviting four professional car thieves to steal either a [[Holden Commodore (VN)|Holden Calais (VN)]] or an EB specified with the locking system. The successful theft of the motor vehicle meant the thief could keep the vehicle indefinitely. The thieves made off with the VN in under 60&nbsp;seconds, but gave up on the EB after four days' efforts.

This was the first season run under the new Group 3A rules, with the EB winning seven of nine rounds. [[Glenn Seton Racing]] carried the bulk of success, with drivers [[Glenn Seton]] and [[1980 Formula One season|1980 World Drivers Champion]] [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] finishing first and second, respectively. The [[Dick Johnson Racing]] Falcons driven by [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] and [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] managed to score third and fifth.\n\nThe Seton team's second EB Falcon driven by [[Geoff Brabham]] and [[David \"Skippy\" Parsons|David Parsons]] won the [[1993 Sandown 500]] (the first Falcon to win the Sandown endurance race since [[Allan Moffat]] in an [[Ford Falcon (XB)|XB Falcon GT hardtop]] in [[1974 Sandown 250|1974]]), though a mid-year aerodynamic package given to the Holden Commodore (VP)'s made the Falcons not as competitive at [[1993 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]]. The Falcon received its own upgrade in 1994 with the addition of small wings on the side of the front air dam, which brought it back into contention.

The most noticeable changes were the transfer of the Ford emblem from the tip of the bonnet to the grille and a full-length applique bridging the gap between the tail lights, featuring [[reversing light|reversing lamps]] on both sides of the rear number plate. Additionally, the [[pillar (car)|C-pillar]] air vents were removed.<ref name = FalconFactsEB>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/falcon-fairmont/eb-falcon-1991-1993/ | title = EB Falcon (1991\u20131993) | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 2007-06-06}}</ref> The return of the [[V8 engine]] since its demise in the [[Ford Falcon (XE)]] of 1982 was welcomed by the motoring press, but the 5.0-litre [[Ford Windsor engine|Windsor]] unit did not reappear in the utility variants until the \"[[Ford Falcon (EF)|EF]]-shaped\" [[Ford Falcon (XH)|XH series]] of 1996. The V8 was paired to the four-speed [[Drivetrain Systems International#M95LE|M95LE]] automatic transmission.

This brought the nominal total swept capacity to 4.0&nbsp;litres.<ref name = FalconFactsEB/> The automatic transmission was updated to the [[Drivetrain Systems International#M91LE|M91LE]] specification, and the electronics were also improved, and the styling was tweaked. The base model now had body-coloured bumpers, and the previously matte black plastic exterior door handles were now given a glossy finish. The update reportedly cost {{AUD|1&nbsp;million}}.<ref name = FalconFactsEB/>\n\nInnovation became an evident strength in the EB II: [[antilock brakes]] became an option, a Falcon first, and in 1993, a lap sash centre rear seatbelt became standard.<ref name = FalconFactsEB/> The EB also introduced the \"Smartlock\" security locking system. [[South Australian Police]] revealed the operational success of \"Smartlock\" by inviting four professional car thieves to steal either a [[Holden Commodore (VN)|Holden Calais (VN)]] or an EB specified with the locking system. The successful theft of the motor vehicle meant the thief could keep the vehicle indefinitely. The thieves made off with the VN in under 60&nbsp;seconds, but gave up on the EB after four days' efforts. Therefore, the EB was classified unstealable.<ref name = FalconFactsEB/> Foam-filled [[pillar (car)|A pillars]] also featured, which greatly increased crush protection and stiffened the frame, thus helping to reduce [[noise, vibration, and harshness]].<ref name = FalconFactsEB/>\n\nThe rarest model was the SS, with just 10 produced. The EB II SS was built to be successful under [[Group 3E Series Production Cars]], five were absorbed immediately into [[Australian Production Car Championship|production car racing]].

This was the first season run under the new Group 3A rules, with the EB winning seven of nine rounds. [[Glenn Seton Racing]] carried the bulk of success, with drivers [[Glenn Seton]] and [[1980 Formula One season|1980 World Drivers Champion]] [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] finishing first and second, respectively. The [[Dick Johnson Racing]] Falcons driven by [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] and [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] managed to score third and fifth.\n\nThe Seton teams second EB Falcon driven by [[Geoff Brabham]] and [[David \"Skippy\" Parsons|David Parsons]] won the [[1993 Sandown 500]] (the first Falcon to win the Sandown endurance race since [[Allan Moffat]] in an [[Ford Falcon (XB)|XB Falcon GT hardtop]] in [[1974 Sandown 250|1974]]), though a mid-year aerodynamic package given to the Holden Commodore (VP)'s made the Falcons not as competitive at [[1993 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]]. The Falcon received its own upgrade in 1994 with the addition of small wings on the side of the front air dam, which brought it back into contention. This allowed the DJR Falcon driven by Dick Johnson and John Bowe to win both the [[1994 Sandown 500]] and the [[1994 Tooheys 1000]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]]. This was the Falcon's first Bathurst win since Johnson and [[John French (racing driver)|John French]] won the crash-shortened [[1981 James Hardie 1000|1981 race]] in an [[Ford XD Falcon|XD Falcon]] and the Falcon's 9th [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]]/Bathurst win overall.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ford Falcon (XF)]] \u2013 this utility pickup and panel van of the Falcon line ran concurrently with the EB series of sedans and wagons.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Ford Australia timeline}}\n{{Ford Falcon}}\n\n[[Category:Ford Falcon|EB]]\n[[Category:Cars of Australia]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Ford Australia vehicles|EB Falcon]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMotorsport:Typo fixing, replaced: teams second \u2192 team's second", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(EB)"}

In her last moments she hands her son to her husband to take care of. The husband does his best to raise his son, working as a road construction worker. He eventually dies of fatigue, leaving the boy alone.\n\nTwenty years later the boy, now going by Brother Jin, has grown up to be a road construction worker like his father. He and his friends - Old Zhang, Zhang Da, Little Luo, and Zheng Junli, are having trouble finding work in the city after being fired over a fight between Brother Jin and Old Zhang. As they search for employment, they meet Little Six, a former thief who joins their group. The group decide to join the road construction team to participate in the building of an important military road. During their travels through China constructing the road, the group meets two women \u2014 Ding Xiang and Jasmine. As the military situation in the area grows more intense, the road workers and soldiers stay up all night and work together constructing the road.\n\nEventually, the enemy approaches Hu, a local rich man, and persuades him to convince the men to stop building the road. Hu invites Brother Jin and the other workers to a banquet at his house and proceeds to offer them goods in an attempt to persuade them to give up on the road. During the banquet Brother Jin and his friends refuse Hu's request. The six workers are imprisoned in Hu's basement, tied up, beaten and tortured. Dingxiang and Jasmine begin to suspect something may have happened when the men don't return from the banquet. The next day, Ding Xiang and Jasmine enter the Hu's house to rescue Brother Jin and the others. Jasmine seduces Hu, and while he is distracted, Ding Xiang and Jasmine go to the kitchen. Jasmine threatens the servant with scissors, to bring them to where the prisoners are being kept. Ding Xiang goes to inform Chief Liu and the army, and get help. Meanwhile, Brother Jin uses the scissors to cut himself free and the rest of his group. He is caught by a guard, and Old Zhang sacrifices himself during the rescue. The army and other workers rally to go to Hu's house and rescue the prisoners. They force themselves into the house, and capture Hu.\n\nAfter Brother Jin and his friends return to the village, the local garrison reports and punishes the traitors. Once the group begin working on the road again an enemy plane suddenly attacks and kills most of the workers along with Moli. Dingxiang stands with her father in the aftermath of the attack.

The road construction refers to the physical pressure of the job.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Berry |first1=Chris |title=Chinese left cinema in the 1930s Poisonous weeds or national treasures |url=https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC34folder/30sLeftChinaFilms.html |website=Jump Cut |publisher=A Review of Contemporary Media |accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref> The performance of the \"anti-corruption\" qi of the brotherhood between men and the death of the same life perfectly reflects the traditional Chinese male values and ethical concepts.\n\nThe film's notion of the Chinese family is firmly anchored in two relationships \u2013 the individual and the family, as well as the nation and the family.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/02560046.2015.1059557|title = The portrayal of family in early Chinese melodrama films|journal = Critical Arts|volume = 29|issue = 3|pages = 419\u2013436|year = 2015|last1 = Han|first1 = Qijun}}</ref>\n\nChris Berry's suggestions about the \"oddball figure\" of Li Lili's Moli character in Big Road are relevant to Li Lili's character in ''Such Luxury'' Li's Moli can be read as a partly unprecedented type, as well as a reinscription of types like the [[Dan role#Wu Dan|Wudan]], the female warrior of opera in China.<ref>Berry, Chris (1988) \"The Sublimatative Text: Sex and Revolution in Big Road\". ''East West Film Journal'', 2:2 (June), pp. 66-85</ref>\n\nThe patriotic narrative was in constant tension with visual pleasure in Sun's films after 1933 (Litter Toy, Sports Queen, The Big Road), diverting the woman's bodily display from the intimate space of [[heterosexuality]] to a more open site. Women's bodies became a public site of propaganda. Under the struggle between patriotic discourse and visual pleasure, women characters in these films went far beyond the male (as the subject) and female (as the object) binary gender matrix.<ref>Zhang, Ying (2011).[https://search.proquest.com/docview/927582091?pq-origsite=gscholar \"TRANSCENDING \"VOYEURISM\" : REREADING FEMALE BODY DISPLAY AND WOMAN'S DESIRE IN SUN YU'S 1930S FILMS\".]  ''International Journal of Arts & Sciences'', pp. 305-325</ref>\n\nScholar Hye Seung Chung suggests that The Big Road is an allegory of Sino-Korean unity, one that was founded upon a common resistance against the Japanese Empire at the time of the film's release and embodied by the films Korean-born star Jin Yan.<ref>Chung, Hye Seung. \u201cThe Korean Valentino: Jin Yan (Kim Y\u014fm), Sino-Korean Unity, and Shanghai Films of the 1930s.\u201d Korean Studies, vol. 37, 2013, pp. 150\u2013170.

The film shows shirtless males, and allows for observation of a man through a woman's eyes. In the movie, there are lots of images of 'the naked man' which was uncommon during this time. For example, there was a shot showed the naked men bathing in the river. It conveys the influence of Western culture in China during the 1930s. Shanghai, as a modern city, would tend to become more accepting.<ref>\u5927\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d41\u91d1\u5dc5\u5cf0\u4e4b\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b,url:https://baike.baidu.com/reference/2769458/dbc1_w9C7fz2bsXGAYRqRmo1PcAsd5tpF0BSa6TZlKAbDM6E9QQzCiVqCQhNvZhpVrrlq51l_dyba_u7rqafWzRXXcZqYaxAE_lcpr8WFTkfjjDrFEc</ref>\n\nThere are two types of love portrayed in the film. The love of Xiao Luo and Ding Xiang is explicit and happy. The other is Brother Jin and Jasmine. The love is implicit and restrained, and there is no direct expression of affection between them, until the very end of the film during a live and death scenario in which they finally held hands. In addition, the film's use of montage along with outstanding performance of the actors allowed many scene to become classic in the history of Chinese film.<ref>\u5927\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d41\u91d1\u5dc5\u5cf0\u4e4b\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b,url:https://baike.baidu.com/reference/2769458/dbc1_w9C7fz2bsXGAYRqRmo1PcAsd5tpF0BSa6TZlKAbDM6E9QQzCiVqCQhNvZhpVrrlq51l_dyba_u7rqafWzRXXcZqYaxAE_lcpr8WFTkfjjDrFEc</ref>\n\nIn the movie, there were lots of naked man image. It was uncommon during the old time. For example, there was a shot showed naked man were taking shower in the river. It conveyed that western culture influenced China. Shanghai, as a modern city, would tend to become more open. \nThere was also a homosexual love trend that entered Shanghai. In the movie, there were some implicit shots that may contain some meanings of lesbian or gay relationships. For example, the director represents the close relationship between Jasmine and Ding Xiang by showing they hugged and kissed each other when laid in one chairs. However, the conversation between them is about males, so it may be the fantasy for the audience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=\u5b59 |first1=\u732e\u97ec |title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5f71\u767e\u5e74\u53f2 |date=2017 |pages=222}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nFeatured in the film is one original theme song, \"Song of the Big Road\" ([https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A7%E8%B7%AF%E6%AD%8C \u5927\u8def\u6b4c]), composed by [[Nie Er]], with lyrics by [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]].

The movie possesses both strong plot as well as aesthetic images. In the story, there is death, love, hatred. Accompanied by Director Sun Yu\u2019s instructive directing style, the Big Road impressed a lot of hot-blooded youngsters and motivated people\u2019s determination to protect their homeland.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=Shan |title=\u5927\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d41\u91d1\u5dc5\u5cf0\u4e4b\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b |url=https://baike.baidu.com/reference/2769458/dbc1_w9C7fz2bsXGAYRqRmo1PcAsd5tpF0BSa6TZlKAbDM6E9QQzCiVqCQhNvZhpVrrlq51l_dyba_u7rqafWzRXXcZqYaxAE_lcpr8WFTkfjjDrFEc}}</ref>\n\n'''''The Big Road''''' was sent to the 1935 Moscow International Film Festival as one of the first films of China to participate in the International Film Festival. However, in order to avoid the obstruction of the northeast Japanese invaders, the movie was detoured in the delivery to Moscow, and did not catch up with the film festival. (\"Yuguangqu\" was delivered on time and won the \"honorary award\"). Later, the Chinese film retrospective was frequently held in many countries. The unique film art style of the \"Big Road\" has won the attention and praise of foreign audiences and critics. For example, at the China Film Retrospective Exhibition held in London in 1985, \"The Big Road\" was praised by the British industry as the opening film screening. History proves that \"The Big Road\" is a classic in the history of Chinese cinema.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5f71\u7531\u65e0\u58f0\u5230\u6709\u58f0\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u4f5c\u54c1 |url=https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1618182833494578020&wfr=spider&for=pc}}</ref>\n\nThe film expresses a strong patriotic message, but it has not been able to attack Japan\u2019s militarism and aggression misconduct because of the national policy of advocating peace and tolerance. It is precisely because of this that the film cannot directly point out that the \"enemy\" is Japanese. Despite this, the patriotic sentiment of the film is also very incisive, the message is clear, and the national song composer Nie Er made several songs for this film, which is even more impressive.\n\n==DVD release==\n''The Big Road'' was released in the United States on Region 0 DVD on May 8, 2007 by [[Cinema Epoch]].

During the banquet Brother Jin and his friends refuse Hu's request. The six workers are imprisoned in Hu's basement, tied up, beaten and tortured. Dingxiang and Jasmine begin to suspect something may have happened when the men don't return from the banquet. The next day, Ding Xiang and Jasmine enter the Hu's house to rescue Brother Jin and the others. Jasmine seduces Hu, and while he is distracted, Ding Xiang and Jasmine go to the kitchen. Jasmine threatens the servant with scissors, to bring them to where the prisoners are being kept. Ding Xiang goes to inform Chief Liu and the army, and get help. Meanwhile, Brother Jin uses the scissors to cut himself free and the rest of his group. He is caught by a guard, and Old Zhang sacrifices himself during the rescue. The army and other workers rally to go to Hu's house and rescue the prisoners. They force themselves into the house, and capture Hu.\n\nAfter Brother Jin and his friends return to the village, the local garrison reports and punishes the traitors. Once the group begin working on the road again an enemy plane suddenly attacks and kills most of the workers along with Moli. Dingxiang stands with her father in the aftermath of the attack. Dingxiang, watches as the superimposed images of the dead workers rise up and continue to work on the road.\n\nThe film's historical background is the Manchurian Invasion by the Japanese military, which is exemplified through song and subtle character details (such as Jasmine).\n\n==Cast & Character Introduction==\n\n*[[Jin Yan]] \u91d1\u7130, as Brother Jin and his father\uff1aBrother Jin is a strong, hard-working man and leader of the road construction group.

Women's bodies became a public site of propaganda. Under the struggle between patriotic discourse and visual pleasure, women characters in these films went far beyond the male (as the subject) and female (as the object) binary gender matrix.<ref>Zhang, Ying (2011).[https://search.proquest.com/docview/927582091?pq-origsite=gscholar \"TRANSCENDING \"VOYEURISM\" : REREADING FEMALE BODY DISPLAY AND WOMAN'S DESIRE IN SUN YU'S 1930S FILMS\".]  ''International Journal of Arts & Sciences'', pp. 305-325</ref>\n\nScholar Hye Seung Chung suggests that The Big Road is an allegory of Sino-Korean unity, one that was founded upon a common resistance against the Japanese Empire at the time of the film's release and embodied by the films Korean-born star Jin Yan.<ref>Chung, Hye Seung. \u201cThe Korean Valentino: Jin Yan (Kim Y\u014fm), Sino-Korean Unity, and Shanghai Films of the 1930s.\u201d Korean Studies, vol. 37, 2013, pp. 150\u2013170.

The film shows shirtless males, and allows for observation of a man through a woman's eyes. In the movie, there are lots of images of 'the naked man' which was uncommon during this time. For example, there was a shot showed the naked men bathing in the river. It conveys the influence of Western culture in China during the 1930s. Shanghai, as a modern city, would tend to become more accepting.<ref>\u5927\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d41\u91d1\u5dc5\u5cf0\u4e4b\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b,url:https://baike.baidu.com/reference/2769458/dbc1_w9C7fz2bsXGAYRqRmo1PcAsd5tpF0BSa6TZlKAbDM6E9QQzCiVqCQhNvZhpVrrlq51l_dyba_u7rqafWzRXXcZqYaxAE_lcpr8WFTkfjjDrFEc</ref>\n\nThere are two types of love portrayed in the film. The love of Xiao Luo and Ding Xiang is explicit and happy. The other is Brother Jin and Jasmine. The love is implicit and restrained, and there is no direct expression of affection between them, until the very end of the film during a live and death scenario in which they finally held hands. In addition, the film's use of montage along with outstanding performance of the actors allowed many scene to become classic in the history of Chinese film.<ref>\u5927\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d41\u91d1\u5dc5\u5cf0\u4e4b\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b,url:https://baike.baidu.com/reference/2769458/dbc1_w9C7fz2bsXGAYRqRmo1PcAsd5tpF0BSa6TZlKAbDM6E9QQzCiVqCQhNvZhpVrrlq51l_dyba_u7rqafWzRXXcZqYaxAE_lcpr8WFTkfjjDrFEc</ref>\n\nIn the movie, there were lots of naked man image. It was uncommon during the old time. For example, there was a shot showed naked man were taking shower in the river. It conveyed that western culture influenced China. Shanghai, as a modern city, would tend to become more open. \nThere was also a homosexual love trend that entered Shanghai. In the movie, there were some implicit shots that may contain some meanings of lesbian or gay relationships. For example, the director represents the close relationship between Jasmine and Ding Xiang by showing they hugged and kissed each other when laid in one chairs. However, the conversation between them is about males, so it may be the fantasy for the audience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=\u5b59 |first1=\u732e\u97ec |title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5f71\u767e\u5e74\u53f2 |date=2017 |pages=222}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nFeatured in the film is one original theme song, \"Song of the Big Road\" ([https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A7%E8%B7%AF%E6%AD%8C \u5927\u8def\u6b4c]), composed by [[Nie Er]], with lyrics by [[Sun Yu (director)|Sun Yu]].

The movie possesses both strong plot as well as aesthetic images. In the story, there is death, love, hatred. Accompanied by Director Sun Yu\u2019s instructive directing style, the Big Road impressed a lot of hot-blooded youngsters and motivated people\u2019s determination to protect their homeland.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=Shan |title=\u5927\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d41\u91d1\u5dc5\u5cf0\u4e4b\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b |url=https://baike.baidu.com/reference/2769458/dbc1_w9C7fz2bsXGAYRqRmo1PcAsd5tpF0BSa6TZlKAbDM6E9QQzCiVqCQhNvZhpVrrlq51l_dyba_u7rqafWzRXXcZqYaxAE_lcpr8WFTkfjjDrFEc}}</ref>\n\n'''''The Big Road''''' was sent to the 1935 Moscow International Film Festival as one of the first films of China to participate in the International Film Festival. However, in order to avoid the obstruction of the northeast Japanese invaders, the movie was detoured in the delivery to Moscow, and did not catch up with the film festival. (\"Yuguangqu\" was delivered on time and won the \"honorary award\"). Later, the Chinese film retrospective was frequently held in many countries. The unique film art style of the \"Big Road\" has won the attention and praise of foreign audiences and critics. For example, at the China Film Retrospective Exhibition held in London in 1985, \"The Big Road\" was praised by the British industry as the opening film screening. History proves that \"The Big Road\" is a classic in the history of Chinese cinema.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u300a\u5927\u8def\u300b\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5f71\u7531\u65e0\u58f0\u5230\u6709\u58f0\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u4f5c\u54c1 |url=https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1618182833494578020&wfr=spider&for=pc}}</ref>\n\nThe film expresses a strong patriotic message, but it has not been able to attack Japan\u2019s militarism and aggression misconduct because of the national policy of advocating peace and tolerance. It is precisely because of this that the film cannot directly point out that the \"enemy\" is Japanese. Despite this, the patriotic sentiment of the film is also very incisive, the message is clear, and the national song composer Nie Er made several songs for this film, which is even more impressive.\n\n==DVD release==\n''The Big Road'' was released in the United States on Region 0 DVD on May 8, 2007 by [[Cinema Epoch]].
