This relevance has a direct impact on its ranking by search engines, trying to assess domain authority through automated analytic algorithms. The relevance of domain authority on website-listing in the [[Search engine results page|SERP]]s of search engines led to the birth of a whole industry of [[Spamdexing|Black Hat SEO]] providers, trying to feign an increased level of domain authority.<ref name=www2006SpamDetection>{{cite journal|last1=Ntoulas|first1=Alexandros|last2=Najork|first2=Marc|last3=Manasse|first3=Mark|last4=Fetterly|first4=Dennis|title=Detecting Spam Web Pages through Content Analysis|journal=International World Wide Web Conference|date=May 23\u201326, 2006|volume=WWW 2006|url=http://www.ra.ethz.ch/CDStore/www2006/devel-www2006.ecs.soton.ac.uk/programme/files/pdf/3052.pdf|ref=ACM 1-59593-323-9/06/0005}}</ref>\nThe ranking by major search engines, e.g., Google\u2019s [[PageRank]] is agnostic of specific industry or subject areas and assesses a website in the context of the totality of websites in the Internet.<ref name=PageBrin_PageRank>{{cite journal|last1=Brin|first1=Sergey|last2=Page|first2=Larry|title=The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web|journal=Stanford University InfoLab Publication Server|date=January 29, 1998|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf}}</ref> The results on the SERP page set the PageRank in the context of a specific keyword. In a less competitive subject area, even websites with a low PageRank can achieve high visibility in search engines as the highest ranked sites that match specific search words are positioned on the first positions in the SERPs.\n\n==Dimensions==\nDomain authority can be described through four dimensions\n# prestige of a website and its authors\n# quality of the information presented\n# information and website centrality\n# competitive situation around a subject\n\nThe weight of these factors varies in function of the ranking body.

Jason has to take care of the kids: ladies' man Mike ([[Kirk Cameron]]), bookish [[honors student]] Carol ([[Tracey Gold]]), and rambunctious Ben ([[Jeremy Miller]]). A fourth child, Chrissy Seaver (twins Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring; [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]), is born on October 27, 1988, a day after Ben's 12th birthday.  She was played in her newborn/infant stage by two uncredited sets of twin sisters, that remained in the role until the end of season four (1988\u201389). By season five (1989\u201390), she was played in her toddler stage by alternating twins Kirsten and Kelsey Dohring. In seasons six and seven (1990\u201392), Chrissy's [[Soap opera rapid aging syndrome|age was advanced]] to five years old. A new cast member was added for the seventh and final season (1991\u201392) when homeless teen Luke Brower ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) is brought into the Seaver family to live with them until nearly the end of season seven.\n\nOften mentioned but rarely seen are the Seavers' next door neighbors the Koosmans - a reference to the [[1969 New York Mets season|1969 Miracle Mets]].\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as Dr. Jason Roland Seaver\n* [[Joanna Kerns]] as Margaret Katherine \"Maggie\" (n\u00e9e Malone) Seaver\n* [[Kirk Cameron]] as Michael Aaron \"Mike\" Seaver\n* [[Tracey Gold]] as Carol Anne Seaver\n* [[Jeremy Miller]] as Benjamin Hubert Horatio Humphrey \"Ben\"  Seaver\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Christine Ellen \"Chrissy\" Seaver (seasons 6\u20137)\n** Kelsey and Kirsten Dohring as Christine Ellen \"Chrissy\" Seaver (toddler) (season 5, alternating)\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Luke Brower (season 7)\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* [[Andrew Koenig]] as Richard Milhous \"Boner\" Stabone (seasons 1\u20134, 25 episodes), Mike's friend; left to join the [[United States Marine Corps]]\n* [[Chelsea Noble]] as Kate MacDonald (seasons 5\u20137, 22 episodes), Mike's girlfriend\n* Jamie Abbott as Stinky Sullivan (seasons 2\u20136, 19 episodes), Ben's friend\n* K.

This is followed by a series of photos of each cast member from their childhood onward ending with a clip from the show. The credits closed with another shot of the cast in front of the Seaver house before they all run inside. Starting in the second season, several different versions of the opening sequence were filmed. Whoever was the last to go into the house would usually be the focus of that week's episode.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe opening used in seasons six and seven featured opening and shot of the mantle on the Seavers' fireplace panning over photos of the cast. The photos of the cast from childhood remained but instead of clips from the show, current still photos were used. Some versions of these credits end with another shot of the mantle while others close with a montage of group shots from the same family photo shoot which the current photos used in the rest of the credits come from.\n\n===Theme song===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nThe show's theme song is \"As Long as We've Got Each Other\", which was written and composed by [[John Bettis]] (lyrics) and [[Steve Dorff]] (music). It was performed by:\n*[[B.J. Thomas]] (singing solo); season 1\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Jennifer Warnes]]; seasons 2, 3, 5, part of 7\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Dusty Springfield]]; season 4\n*[[Joe Chemay]], [[Jim Haas]], Jon Joyce and [[George Merrill (songwriter)|George Merrill]] (singing a capella); season 6, part of 7, series finale\n\nThere were nine versions of the theme song used; others included a Halloween-themed version not sung by Thomas or Warnes used in a two-part Halloween episode in 1990. A shorter version of the Thomas/Warnes version was used starting in season two.\n\nThere was also an [[a cappella]] version of the song which was used for all of season six, but this version was abandoned for most of season seven in favor of the reinstatement of Thomas' and Warnes' duet version, although the a cappella theme returned for three episodes as well as the series finale. A full-length version by Thomas and Springfield was released as a single in 1988.\n\nA soundtrack was released in 1988 titled ''Steve Dorff and Friends: Growing Pains and Other Hit TV Themes.''  The soundtrack contains songs penned by Dorff from his television series theme songs and three tracks from ''Growing Pains'':\n\n# Theme Song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" (B.J. Thomas and Dusty Springfield)\n# Aloha Episode \u2013 \"Swept Away\" by Christopher Cross\n# Graduation Day Episode \u2013 \"This Is The Day\" performed by B.J. Thomas\n\nThe Theme for Growing Pains got airplay on the Adult Contemporary format in early 1989 and peaked at #5 on the Radio & Records AC chart and #7 on the Billboard AC chart.\n\nAnother version of \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" was performed by [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Eric Carmen]] in 1988.  Their version peaked at #51 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Country chart.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n{{:List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

This is followed by a series of photos of each cast member from their childhood onward ending with a clip from the show. The credits closed with another shot of the cast in front of the Seaver house before they all run inside. Starting in the second season, several different versions of the opening sequence were filmed. Whoever was the last to go into the house would usually be the focus of that week's episode.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe opening used in seasons six and seven featured opening and shot of the mantle on the Seavers' fireplace panning over photos of the cast. The photos of the cast from childhood remained but instead of clips from the show, current still photos were used. Some versions of these credits end with another shot of the mantle while others close with a montage of group shots from the same family photo shoot which the current photos used in the rest of the credits come from.\n\n===Theme song===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nThe show's theme song is \"As Long as We've Got Each Other\", which was written and composed by [[John Bettis]] (lyrics) and [[Steve Dorff]] (music). It was performed by:\n*[[B.J. Thomas]] (singing solo); season 1\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Jennifer Warnes]]; seasons 2, 3, 5, part of 7\n*B.J. Thomas & [[Dusty Springfield]]; season 4\n*[[Joe Chemay]], [[Jim Haas]], Jon Joyce and [[George Merrill (songwriter)|George Merrill]] (singing a capella); season 6, part of 7, series finale\n\nThere were nine versions of the theme song used; others included a Halloween-themed version not sung by Thomas or Warnes used in a two-part Halloween episode in 1990. A shorter version of the Thomas/Warnes version was used starting in season two.\n\nThere was also an [[a cappella]] version of the song which was used for all of season six, but this version was abandoned for most of season seven in favor of the reinstatement of Thomas' and Warnes' duet version, although the a cappella theme returned for three episodes as well as the series finale. A full-length version by Thomas and Springfield was released as a single in 1988.\n\nA soundtrack was released in 1988 titled ''Steve Dorff and Friends: Growing Pains and Other Hit TV Themes.''  The soundtrack contains songs penned by Dorff from his television series theme songs and three tracks from ''Growing Pains'':\n\n# Theme Song \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" (B.J. Thomas and Dusty Springfield)\n# Aloha Episode \u2013 \"Swept Away\" by Christopher Cross\n# Graduation Day Episode \u2013 \"This Is The Day\" performed by B.J. Thomas\n\nThe Theme for Growing Pains got airplay on the Adult Contemporary format in early 1989 and peaked at #5 on the Radio & Records AC chart and #7 on the Billboard AC chart.\n\nAnother version of \"As Long As We Got Each Other\" was performed by [[Louise Mandrell]] and [[Eric Carmen]] in 1988.  Their version peaked at #51 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Country chart.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n{{:List of Growing Pains episodes}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

A single word can yield multiple values depending on the [[cipher]] used.\n\nGematria originated as an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code or cipher that was later adopted into [[Jewish culture]].{{Dubious |reason=Babylonian Gematria was logographic and used tables.|date=September 2019}} Similar systems have been used in other languages and cultures: earlier, the Greek [[isopsephy]], and later, derived from or inspired by Hebrew gematria, Arabic [[abjad numerals]], and English gematria.\n\nA well-known example of Hebrew gematria is the word ''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]'' (\"alive\"), which is composed of two letters that (using the assignments in the ''Mispar gadol'' table shown below) add up to 18. This has made 18 a \"[[luck#Numerology|lucky number]]\" among the Jewish people. Gifts of money in multiples of 18 are very popular.<ref>{{cite web |title= Chabad.org Chani Benjaminson |url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484894/jewish/What-is-the-reason-giving-money-in-multiples-of-18.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough the term is [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], it may be derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ''ge\u014dmetri\u0101'', \"[[geometry]]\", which was used as a translation of g\u0113ma\u1e6driy\u0101,<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gematria \"Gematria\" at Dictionary.com]</ref> though some scholars believe it to derive from Greek \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ''grammateia'' \"knowledge of [[writing]]\". It's likely that both Greek words had an influence on the formation of the Hebrew word.<ref>{{OED|gematria}} ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref><ref name=JE /> Some also hold it to derive from the order of the [[Greek alphabet|<nowiki>Greek alphabet</nowiki>]], gamma being the third letter of the Greek alphabet.<ref>Benjamin Blech, \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jewish Culture\", p. 395 (2004)</ref>\n\nThe word has been extant in English since at least the 17th century from translations of works by [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]]. Although ostensibly derived from Greek [[isopsephy]], it is largely used in Jewish texts, notably in those associated with the [[Kabbalah]]. The term does not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]] itself.<ref name=JE />\n\n==Traditional fields of use==\nSome identify two forms of gematria: the \"revealed\" form, which is prevalent in many hermeneutic methods found throughout [[rabbinic literature]], and the \"mystical\" form, a largely [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] practice.<ref>e.g. Aish HaTorah, http://www.aish.com/spirituality/prayer/Prayer_6_-_Hear_O_Israel_Part_1.asp, which says \"It is part of a Kabbalistic tradition ... Gematria is a Kabbalistic way of showing how two ideas are related on a conceptual level; it is using numerology as a basis to confirm (not create) the connection.\"</ref>\nA few instances of gematria in Arabic, Spanish and Greek, spelled with the Hebrew letters, are mentioned in the works of [[Abraham Abulafia]];<ref>Otzar Eden ha-Ganuz,</ref> some [[Rebbe|Hasidic Rebbis]] also used it, although rarely, for [[Yiddish]].<ref>E.g. the rebbes of the [[Zidichov (Hasidic dynasty)|Zhidichov dynasty]] noticed that the Yiddish word ''vaser'' (water) has the same value as ''Geshem'' (''rain'' in Hebrew), and used this fact for [[Theurgy|theurgic]] meditations</ref>\n\n==History==\nSome scholars think it possible that gematria is encoded in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. For example, [[Israel Knohl]] noted that \u201cit is not out of the question that this technique was already known in the biblical period and was used specifically in religious contexts\u201d,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/24144116|title=The Original Version of the Priestly Creation Account and the Religious Significance of the Number Eight in the Bible |last=Knohl|first=Israel|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref> and has hypothesized \u201cthe fact that the representation of the numerical values of letters is not demonstrated in mundane use in ancient Israel before the Hellenistic period may point to the possibility that this method was first a sacred secret knowledge that was kept in closed circles\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knohl|first=Israel|date=2012|title=Sacred Architecture: The Numerical Dimensions of Biblical Poems|journal=Vetus Testamentum|volume=62|issue=2|pages=189\u2013197|doi=10.1163/156853312x629199|issn=0042-4935}}</ref> Victor Hurowitz points out \u201c[[Numerology|numerological]] principles in the organization of the book [of Proverbs]\u201d and demonstrates that Gematria has Mesopotamian precedents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hurowitz|first=Victor|date=2012|title=Proverbs: Introduction and Commentary|url=|journal=Miqra LeYisrael|volume=1-2|pages=|via=}}</ref> Stephen J.

The calculation of the [[equinox]]es and ''gematriot'' are the condiments of wisdom.<ref>[[Pirkei Avot]] 3:23</ref>}}\n\n[[Herbert Danby]], in his Mishna translation, explains ''gematriot'' as follows: \n{{quote|Astronomy and geometry are meant. Of these [[Eleazar Chisma]] is reported to have been a diligent student. 'Gematria' later came to mean the device of finding esoteric meanings in words by means of the numerical values of their constituent letters.<ref>''The Mishnah'', trans. by Herbert Danby, Oxford University Press, 1933, Avot 3:19, footnote</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Danby also notes a case of the latter kind of gematria already in Mishnah [[Uktzin]] 3:12.\n\nIn the [[Talmud]], the term ''gematria'' is also used to refer to a different concept: the [[atbash]] cipher.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.22a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Sanhedrin 22a]</ref>\n\nA Biblical commentary incorporating ''gematria'' is ''Baal ha-Turim'' by [[Jacob ben Asher]].<ref>[http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=1133]</ref>\n\n==Methods==\n===Standard encoding===\nIn the standard (''Mispar hechrechi'') version of ''gematria'', each letter is given a numerical value between 1 and 400, as shown in the following table.

More advanced methods are usually used for the most significant Biblical verses, [[Jewish liturgy|prayers]], names of God and angels etc. These methods include:<ref>[[Moshe Cordovero]], [https://www.hebrewbooks.org/45137 Pardes Rimmonim]</ref>\n* ''Mispar Hechrachi'' (absolute value) is the standard method. It assigns the values 1\u20139, 10\u201390, 100\u2013400 to the 22 Hebrew letters in order. Sometimes it is also called ''Mispar ha-Panim'' (face number), as opposed to the more complicated ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' (back number).\n* ''Mispar Gadol'' (large value) counts the final forms (sofit) of the Hebrew letters as a continuation of the numerical sequence for the alphabet, with the final letters assigned values from 500 to 900. The name ''Mispar Gadol'' is sometimes used for a different method, ''Otiyot beMilui''.\n* The same name, ''Mispar Gadol'', is also used for another method, which spells the name of each letter and adds the standard values of the resulting string. For example, the letter ''alef'' is spelled ''alef''-''lamed''-''peh'', giving it a value of 1+30+80=111.\n* ''Mispar Katan'' (small value) calculates the value of each letter, but truncates all of the zeros. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Me'ugal''.\n* ''Mispar Siduri'' (ordinal value) with each of the twenty-two letters given a value from one to twenty-two.\n* ''Mispar Bone'eh'' (building value, also ''Revu'a'', square<ref>Toras Menachem - Tiferes Levi Yitzchok, Vol. I - Bereshis, p. 2, fn. 7</ref>) is calculated by walking over each letter from the beginning to the end, adding the value of all previous letters and the value of the current letter to the running total. Therefore, the value of the word ''achad'' (one) is <math>1 + (1 + 8) + (1 + 8 + 4) = 23</math>.\n* ''Mispar Kidmi'' (preceding value) uses each letter as the sum of all the standard gematria letter values preceding it. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1, the value of Bet is 1+2=3, the value of Gimmel is 1+2+3=6, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular or tripled number).\n* ''Mispar P'rati'' calculates the value of each letter as the square of its standard gematria value. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the value of Bet is 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, the value of gimmel is 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;9, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Prati''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Klali'' is the square of the standard absolute value of each word.\n* ''Mispar Meshulash'' calculates the value of each letter as the cube of their standard value. The same term is more often used for ''Mispar Kidmi''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' \u2013 The value of each letter is its standard value multiplied by the position of the letter in a word or a phrase in either ascending or descending order. This method is particularly interesting, because the result is sensitive to the order of letters. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular number).\n* ''Mispar Mispari'' spells out the standard values of each letter by their Hebrew names (\"Achad\" (one) is <math>1+8+4=13</math> etc.), and then adds up the standard values of the resulting string.\n* ''Otiyot beMilui'' (\"filled letters\", also known as ''Mispar gadol'' or ''Mispar Shemi''), uses the value of each letter as equal to the value of its name.<ref>the spelling of the name of the number comes from the Talmud</ref> For example, the value of the letter Aleph is <math>(1 + 30 + 80) = 111</math>, Bet is <math>(2 + 10 + 400) = 412</math>, etc. Sometimes the same operation is applied two or more times recursively. In a variation known as ''Otiyot pnimiyot'' (inner letters), the initial letter in the spelled-out name is omitted, thus the value of Alef becomes 30+80=110.\n* ''Mispar Ne'elam'' (hidden number) spells out the name of each letter without the letter itself (e.g., \"Leph\" for \"Aleph\") and adds up the value of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Katan Mispari'' (integral reduced value) is used where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to a single digit. If the sum of the value exceeds 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to produce a single-digit number. The same value will be arrived at regardless of whether it is the absolute values, the ordinal values, or the reduced values that are being counted by methods above.\n* ''Mispar Misafi'' adds the number of the letters in the word or phrase to their gematria.\n* ''Kolel'' is the number of words, which is often added to the gematria. In case of one word, the standard value is incremented by one.\n\n===Related alphabet transformations===\nWithin the wider topic of Gematria are included the various alphabet transformations where one letter is substituted by another based on a logical scheme:\n* ''[[Atbash]]'' exchanges each letter in a word or a phrase by ''opposite'' letters. Opposite letters are determined by substituting the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph) with the last letter (Tav), the second letter (Bet) with the next to last (Shin), etc. The result can be interpreted as a secret message or calculated by the standard gematria methods. A few instances of Atbash are found already in the Hebrew [[Bible]]. For example, see [[Jeremiah]] 25:26, and 51:41, with [[Targum Jonathan|Targum]] and [[Rashi]], in which the name \u05e9\u05e9\u05da (\"Sheshek\") is thought to represent \u05d1\u05d1\u05dc ([[Babylon]]).<ref name=JE>{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6571-gematria|title=GEMA\u1e6cRIA|authors=[[Solomon Schechter]] & Caspar Levias}}</ref>\n* ''Albam'' \u2013 the alphabet is divided in half, eleven letters in each section. The first letter of the first series is exchanged for the first letter of the second series, the second letter of the first series for the second letter of the second series and so forth.\n* ''Achbi'' divides the alphabet into two equal groups of eleven letters. Within each group, the first letter is replaced by the last, the second by the tenth, etc.\n* ''Ayak Bakar'' replaces each letter by another one that has a 10-times-greater value. The final letters usually signify the numbers from 500 to 900. Thousands is reduced to ones (1000 becomes 1, 2000 becomes 2 etc.)\n* ''Ofanim'' replaces each letter by the last letter of its name (e.g. \"Fe\" for \"Aleph\").\n* ''Akhas Beta'' divides the alphabet into three groups of 7, 7 and 8 letters. Each letter is replaced cyclically by the corresponding letter of the next group. The letter [[Tav (letter)|Tav]] remains the same.\n* ''Avgad'' replaces each letter by the next one. Tav becomes Aleph. The opposite operation is also used.\nMost of the above-mentioned methods and ciphers are listed by Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moshe Cordevero]].<ref>Moshe Cordevero, ''Sefer Pardes ha-Rimonim'', ''\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea''</ref>\n\nSome authors provide lists of as many as 231 various replacement ciphers, related to the 231 mystical Gates of the [[Sefer Yetzirah]].<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\">Elazar Rokeach, Sefer ha-Shem</ref>\n\nDozens of other far more advanced methods are used in Kabbalistic literature, without any particular names. In Ms. Oxford 1,822, one article lists 75 different forms of gematria.<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica'', 2007, vol. 7, 426</ref> Some known methods are [[recursion|recursive]] in nature and are reminiscent of the [[graph theory]] or use heavily [[combinatorics]]. Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]] often used multiplication, instead of addition, for the above-mentioned methods. For example, spelling out the letters of a word and then multiplying the squares of each letter value in the resulting string produces very large numbers, in orders of [[10^12|trillions]]. The spelling process can be applied recursively, until a certain pattern (e.g., all the letters of the word \"[[Talmud]]\") is found; the gematria of the resulting string is then calculated. The same author also used sums of all possible unique letter combinations, which add up to the value of a given letter. For example, the letter [[He (letter)|Hei]], which has the standard value of 5, can be produced by combining <math>1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</math>, <math>2 + 1 + 1 + 1</math>, <math>3 + 1 + 1</math>, <math>4+2</math>, <math>2 + 2 + 1</math>, or <math>2+3</math>, which adds up to <math>30</math>. Sometimes combinations of repeating letters are not allowed (e.g., <math>2+3</math> is valid, but <math>3 + 1 + 1</math> is not). The original letter itself can also be viewed as a valid combination.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\" />\n\nVariant spellings of some letters can be used to produce sets of different numbers, which can be added up or analyzed separately. Many various complex [[formal systems]] and recursive algorithms, based on graph-like structural analysis of the letter names and their relations to each other, [[modular arithmetic]], pattern search and other highly advanced techniques, are found in the \"Sefer ha-Malchuth\" by Rabbi David ha-Levi of [[Draa|Draa Valley]], a Spanish-Moroccan Kabbalist of the 15\u201316th century.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Malchut\">Sefer ha-Malchut, \"Sifrei Chaim\", Jerusalem, 2008</ref> Rabbi David ha-Levi's methods take into consideration the numerical values and other properties of the [[Niqqud|vowels]] as well.\n\nKabbalistic [[Jewish views of astrology|astrology]] uses some specific methods to determine the astrological influences on a particular person. According to one method, the gematria of the person's name is added to the gematria of his or her mother's name; the result is then divided by 7 and 12. The remainders signify a particular planet and Zodiac sign.<ref>Commentary to [[Sefer Yetzirah]], attributed to [[Saadia Gaon]], 6:4; Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah, \"WeiserBooks\", Boston, 1997, pp. 220-221</ref>\n\n==Absolute value==\nThe most common form of Hebrew ''gematria'' is used in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], and elaborately by many post-Talmudic [[rabbinic literature|commentators]]. It involves reading words and sentences as numbers, assigning numerical instead of phonetic value to each letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

A direct review of the Cratylus, however, shows that Plato made no such claim and that gematria is not discussed in it either explicitly or implicitly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} What can be more accurately stated is that Plato's discussion in the Cratylus involves a view of words and names as referring (more or less accurately) to the \"essential nature\" of a person or object, and that this view may have influenced \u2013 and is central to \u2013 ''Greek gematria''.<ref>Marc Hirshman, ''Theology and exegesis in midrashic literature'', in Jon Whitman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7EjIm3pAfhQC&pg=PA113 Interpretation and allegory: antiquity to the modern period].

According to such interpretations, the number in question, ''six hundred sixty-six'' (666; see {{Bibleref2|Revelation 13:18}}) was originally derived from the [[Latin]] name of the Roman emperor at the time, [[Nero Caesar]], via the Greek, 'Neron Kaisar', and transliterated into Hebrew gematria.

More advanced methods are usually used for the most significant Biblical verses, [[Jewish liturgy|prayers]], names of God and angels etc. These methods include:<ref>[[Moshe Cordovero]], [https://www.hebrewbooks.org/45137 Pardes Rimmonim]</ref>\n* ''Mispar Hechrachi'' (absolute value) is the standard method. It assigns the values 1-9, 10-90, 100-400 to the 22 Hebrew letters in order. Sometimes it is also called ''Mispar ha-Panim'' (face number), as opposed to the more complicated ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' (back number).\n* ''Mispar Gadol'' (large value) counts the final forms (sofit) of the Hebrew letters as a continuation of the numerical sequence for the alphabet, with the final letters assigned values from 500 to 900. The name ''Mispar Gadol'' is sometimes used for a different method, ''Otiyot beMilui''.\n* The same name, ''Mispar Gadol'', is also used for another method, which spells the name of each letter and adds the standard values of the resulting string. For example, the letter ''alef'' is spelled ''alef''-''lamed''-''peh'', giving it a value of 1+30+80=111.\n* ''Mispar Katan'' (small value) calculates the value of each letter, but truncates all of the zeros. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Me'ugal''.\n* ''Mispar Siduri'' (ordinal value) with each of the twenty-two letters given a value from one to twenty-two.\n* ''Mispar Bone'eh'' (building value, also ''Revu'a'', square<ref>Toras Menachem - Tiferes Levi Yitzchok, Vol. I - Bereshis, p. 2, fn. 7</ref>) is calculated by walking over each letter from the beginning to the end, adding the value of all previous letters and the value of the current letter to the running total. Therefore, the value of the word ''achad'' (one) is <math>1 + (1 + 8) + (1 + 8 + 4) = 23</math>.\n* ''Mispar Kidmi'' (preceding value) uses each letter as the sum of all the standard gematria letter values preceding it. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1, the value of Bet is 1+2=3, the value of Gimmel is 1+2+3=6, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular or tripled number).\n* ''Mispar P'rati'' calculates the value of each letter as the square of its standard gematria value. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the value of Bet is 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, the value of gimmel is 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;9, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Prati''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Klali'' is the square of the standard absolute value of each word.\n* ''Mispar Meshulash'' calculates the value of each letter as the cube of their standard value. The same term is more often used for ''Mispar Kidmi''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' \u2013 The value of each letter is its standard value multiplied by the position of the letter in a word or a phrase in either ascending or descending order. This method is particularly interesting, because the result is sensitive to the order of letters. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular number).\n* ''Mispar Mispari'' spells out the standard values of each letter by their Hebrew names (\"Achad\" (one) is <math>1+8+4=13</math> etc.), and then adds up the standard values of the resulting string.\n* ''Otiyot beMilui'' (\"filled letters\", also known as ''Mispar gadol'' or ''Mispar Shemi''), uses the value of each letter as equal to the value of its name.<ref>the spelling of the name of the number comes from the Talmud</ref> For example, the value of the letter Aleph is <math>(1 + 30 + 80) = 111</math>, Bet is <math>(2 + 10 + 400) = 412</math>, etc. Sometimes the same operation is applied two or more times recursively. In a variation known as ''Otiyot pnimiyot'' (inner letters), the initial letter in the spelled-out name is omitted, thus the value of Alef becomes 30+80=110.\n* ''Mispar Ne'elam'' (hidden number) spells out the name of each letter without the letter itself (e.g., \"Leph\" for \"Aleph\") and adds up the value of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Katan Mispari'' (integral reduced value) is used where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to a single digit. If the sum of the value exceeds 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to produce a single-digit number. The same value will be arrived at regardless of whether it is the absolute values, the ordinal values, or the reduced values that are being counted by methods above.\n* ''Mispar Misafi'' adds the number of the letters in the word or phrase to their gematria.\n* ''Kolel'' is the number of words, which is often added to the gematria. In case of one word, the standard value is incremented by one.\n\n===Related alphabet transformations===\nWithin the wider topic of Gematria are included the various alphabet transformations where one letter is substituted by another based on a logical scheme:\n* ''[[Atbash]]'' exchanges each letter in a word or a phrase by ''opposite'' letters. Opposite letters are determined by substituting the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph) with the last letter (Tav), the second letter (Bet) with the next to last (Shin), etc. The result can be interpreted as a secret message or calculated by the standard gematria methods. A few instances of Atbash are found already in the Hebrew [[Bible]]. For example, see [[Jeremiah]] 25:26, and 51:41, with [[Targum Jonathan|Targum]] and [[Rashi]], in which the name \u05e9\u05e9\u05da (\"Sheshek\") is thought to represent \u05d1\u05d1\u05dc ([[Babylon]]).<ref name=JE>{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6571-gematria|title=GEMA\u1e6cRIA|authors=[[Solomon Schechter]] & Caspar Levias}}</ref>\n* ''Albam'' \u2013 the alphabet is divided in half, eleven letters in each section. The first letter of the first series is exchanged for the first letter of the second series, the second letter of the first series for the second letter of the second series and so forth.\n* ''Achbi'' divides the alphabet into two equal groups of eleven letters. Within each group, the first letter is replaced by the last, the second by the tenth, etc.\n* ''Ayak Bakar'' replaces each letter by another one that has a 10-times-greater value. The final letters usually signify the numbers from 500 to 900.  Thousands is reduced to ones (1000 becomes 1, 2000 becomes 2 etc.)\n* ''Ofanim'' replaces each letter by the last letter of its name (e.g. \"Fe\" for \"Aleph\").\n* ''Akhas Beta'' divides the alphabet into three groups of 7, 7 and 8 letters. Each letter is replaced cyclically by the corresponding letter of the next group. The letter [[Tav (letter)|Tav]] remains the same.\n* ''Avgad'' replaces each letter by the next one. Tav becomes Aleph. The opposite operation is also used.\nMost of the above-mentioned methods and ciphers are listed by Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moshe Cordevero]].<ref>Moshe Cordevero, ''Sefer Pardes ha-Rimonim'', ''\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea''</ref>\n\nSome authors provide lists of as many as 231 various replacement ciphers, related to the 231 mystical Gates of the [[Sefer Yetzirah]].<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\">Elazar Rokeach, Sefer ha-Shem</ref>\n\nDozens of other far more advanced methods are used in Kabbalistic literature, without any particular names. In Ms. Oxford 1,822, one article lists 75 different forms of gematria.<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica'', 2007, vol. 7, 426</ref> Some known methods are [[recursion|recursive]] in nature and are reminiscent of the [[graph theory]] or use heavily [[combinatorics]]. Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]] often used multiplication, instead of addition, for the above-mentioned methods. For example, spelling out the letters of a word and then multiplying the squares of each letter value in the resulting string produces very large numbers, in orders of [[10^12|trillions]]. The spelling process can be applied recursively, until a certain pattern (e.g., all the letters of the word \"[[Talmud]]\") is found; the gematria of the resulting string is then calculated.  The same author also used sums of all possible unique letter combinations, which add up to the value of a given letter. For example, the letter [[He (letter)|Hei]], which has the standard value of 5, can be produced by combining <math>1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1</math>, <math>2 + 1 + 1 + 1</math>, <math>3 + 1 + 1</math>, <math>4+2</math>, <math>2 + 2 + 1</math>, or <math>2+3</math>, which adds up to <math>30</math>. Sometimes combinations of repeating letters are not allowed (e.g., <math>2+3</math> is valid, but <math>3 + 1 + 1</math> is not). The original letter itself can also be viewed as a valid combination.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\" />\n\nVariant spellings of some letters can be used to produce sets of different numbers, which can be added up or analyzed separately. Many various complex [[formal systems]] and recursive algorithms, based on graph-like structural analysis of the letter names and their relations to each other, [[modular arithmetic]], pattern search and other highly advanced techniques, are found in the \"Sefer ha-Malchuth\" by Rabbi David ha-Levi of [[Draa|Draa Valley]], a Spanish-Moroccan Kabbalist of the 15\u201316th century.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Malchut\">Sefer ha-Malchut, \"Sifrei Chaim\", Jerusalem, 2008</ref> Rabbi David ha-Levi's methods take into consideration the numerical values and other properties of the [[Niqqud|vowels]] as well.\n\nKabbalistic [[Jewish views of astrology|astrology]] uses some specific methods to determine the astrological influences on a particular person. According to one method, the gematria of the person's name is added to the gematria of his or her mother's name; the result is then divided by 7 and 12. The remainders signify a particular planet and Zodiac sign.<ref>Commentary to [[Sefer Yetzirah]], attributed to [[Saadia Gaon]], 6:4; Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah, \"WeiserBooks\", Boston, 1997, pp. 220-221</ref>\n\n==Absolute value==\nThe most common form of Hebrew ''gematria'' is used in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], and elaborately by many post-Talmudic [[rabbinic literature|commentators]]. It involves reading words and sentences as numbers, assigning numerical instead of phonetic value to each letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. When read as numbers, they can be compared and contrasted with other words or phrases&nbsp;\u2013 cf. the Hebrew proverb {{lang|he|\u05e0\u05db\u05e0\u05e1&nbsp;\u05d9\u05d9\u05df&nbsp;\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0&nbsp;\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3}} (''{{transl|he|nichnas&nbsp;yayin&nbsp;yatza&nbsp;sod}}'', lit. \"wine entered, secret went out\", i.e. \"''in vino veritas''\"). The gematric value of {{lang|he|\u05d9\u05d9\u05df}} (\"wine\") is 70 ({{lang|he|\u05d9}}=10; {{lang|he|\u05d9}}=10; {{lang|he|\u05df}}=50) and this is also the gematric value of {{lang|he|\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3}} (\"secret\", {{lang|he|\u05e1}}=60; {{lang|he|\u05d5}}=6; {{lang|he|\u05d3}}=4)&lrm;.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]] 38a, see of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"'[[false etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity.

Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237-258.</ref>\n\n==Use in other languages==\n===Assyrian===\nThe first attested use of gematria occurs in an inscription of [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] (727\u2013705 BCE) stating that the king built the wall of [[Khorsabad]] 16,283 cubits long to correspond with the numerical value of his name.<ref>p.197, Ratzan</ref>{{dubious|Actually insufficiently clear: what language did he use?

A direct review of the Cratylus, however, shows that Plato made no such claim and that gematria is not discussed in it either explicitly or implicitly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} What can be more accurately stated is that Plato's discussion in the Cratylus involves a view of words and names as referring (more or less accurately) to the \"essential nature\" of a person or object, and that this view may have influenced \u2013 and is central to \u2013 ''Greek gematria''.<ref>Marc Hirshman, ''Theology and exegesis in midrashic literature'', in Jon Whitman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7EjIm3pAfhQC&pg=PA113 Interpretation and allegory: antiquity to the modern period].

According to such interpretations, the number in question, ''six hundred sixty-six'' (666; see {{Bibleref2|Revelation 13:18}}) was originally derived from the [[Latin]] name of the Roman emperor at the time, [[Nero Caesar]], via the Greek, 'Neron Kaisar', and transliterated into Hebrew gematria. The result of this operation is six hundred sixty-six (<math>50+200+6+50+100+60+200=666</math>.

According to [[Leopold Zunz|Zunz]], Eleazar was [[hazzan]] at [[Erfurt]] before he became [[rabbi]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1233 he took part in the [[Synod of Mainz (Jewish)|Synod of Mainz]] which enacted the body of regulations known as \"[[Takkanot Shum]]\" (ShUM = \"Speyer, Worms, Mainz\"),<ref name=Jewish/> of which he was a signatory.\n                                  \n[[File:Massacre of Jews.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Jews of [[Metz]] during the First Crusade, by Auguste Migette.]]\nAccording to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the [[Crusades]]. The ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' states that on the night of 22 [[Kislev]], 1196, he was engaged in his commentary on ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' (Eleazar relates that he had reached the [[parashah]] [[Vayeshev]]), when two [[Crusaders]] entered his house and killed his wife Dulca (Dolce), his two daughters Belet(Belette) and Hannah, and wounded him and his son Jacob who did not escape.

He also recorded the deaths of his family in a moving and poetic eulogy.\n\nEleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a [[liturgist]] gifted with a clear and easy style, and an [[astronomer]], and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous mystic who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread mystical systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of Jewish esoterica. In his mystical works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet.  By the [[gematria]] and [[notarikon]] systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The [[haggadic]] [[anthropomorphism]] which he had combated in his earlier works (''Ha-Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25,'' ''Sha'are ha-Sod weha-Yi\u1e25ud'') occupied later the foremost place in his mystical writings.\nEleazar's great merit therefore lies not only in his new mystical system, but also in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon [[asceticism]]. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Ethical works ==\n* ''Ha-Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25,'' (\"The Perfumer\"), a halachic guide to [[ethics]] and [[Halakha|Jewish Law]] for the common reader.

According to [[Leopold Zunz|Zunz]], Eleazar was [[hazzan]] at [[Erfurt]] before he became [[rabbi]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. In 1233 he took part in the [[Synod of Mainz (Jewish)|Synod of Mainz]] which enacted the body of regulations known as \"[[Takkanot Shum]]\" (ShUM = \"Speyer, Worms, Mainz\"),<ref name=Jewish/> of which he was a signatory.\n                                  \n[[File:Massacre of Jews.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Jews of [[Metz]] during the First Crusade, by Auguste Migette.]]\nAccording to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', Eleazar underwent great sufferings during the [[Crusades]].

He also recorded the deaths of his family in a moving and poetic eulogy.\n\nEleazar developed a vigorous activity in many directions. On the one hand, he was a Talmudist of vast erudition, a [[liturgist]] gifted with a clear and easy style, and an [[astronomer]], and was well versed in the sciences open to the Jews of Germany at that time. At the same time, he was an adventurous mystic who experienced visions, seeing legions of angels and demons. He exerted himself to spread mystical systems which went far beyond the conceptions of the classical authors of Jewish esoterica. In his mystical works he developed and gave a new impulse to the mysticism associated with the letters of the alphabet.  By the [[gematria]] and [[notarikon]] systems of interpretation found in the Talmud, Eleazar invented new combinations by which miracles could be performed. The [[haggadic]] [[anthropomorphism]] which he had combated in his earlier works (''Ha-Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25,'' ''Sha'are ha-Sod weha-Yi\u1e25ud'') occupied later the foremost place in his mystical writings.\nEleazar's great merit therefore lies not only in his new mystical system, but also in his ethical works. In these he shows greatness of soul and a piety bordering upon [[asceticism]]. Though so severely tried by fate, he inculcates cheerfulness, patience, and love for humanity. He died at Worms in 1238.<ref name=Jewish/>\n\n== Ethical works ==\n* ''Ha-Ro\u1e33ea\u1e25,'' (\"The Perfumer\"), a halachic guide to [[ethics]] and [[Halakha|Jewish Law]] for the common reader.
