They find themselves outside drinking beer and shooting a basketball when two classmates challenge them to a game. After seeing that their opponents are very good at basketball, they say they will only play a game they picked up in the streets (while secretly inventing the rules as they play, based on both basketball and baseball). After winning, they decide to refine the rules to the game and Coop makes the first BASEketball out of a [[La-Z-Boy]] chair. Their friend, Kenny \"Squeak\" Scolari, tags along and the sport becomes very popular in the neighborhood over the next six months.\n\nBusinessman Ted Denslow meets Coop and Remer and proposes the creation of the National BASEketball League (NBL) along with numerous rules in place to prevent its decline: teams cannot switch cities, players cannot be traded, individuals cannot make money via corporate sponsorship deals, and it is completely open to anyone who wants to play, with Denslow stating that \"anyone can be a sports' hero\". Coop initially hesitates, but quickly accepts the opportunity at hand.\n\nFive years later, the NBL is in full swing with teams, fans, stadiums, and a major championship, the Denslow Cup. Denslow is owner of the Milwaukee Beers, Coop and Remer's team. During the championship game, Denslow dies from choking on a hot dog, causing Coop to miss his shot and costing the Beers the game. Denslow's [[Will and testament|will]] names Coop as owner of the Beers for one year on the condition that they win the next Denslow Cup; otherwise, ownership reverts to Denslow's widow Yvette. Coop declares Remer part owner of the team, and they come to meet Jenna Reed, head of the Dream Come True Foundation, and Joey, one of the children in her care and an avid fan of BASEketball.\n\nBaxter Cain, owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to remove Denslow's rules preventing [[monetization]] of the sport, but could not while Denslow was alive. However, Coop refuses to accept any changes; Cain partners with Yvette as he tries to make the Beers lose the next Denslow Cup so she will own the team.\n\nCain cuts the funding to Jenna's foundation to get Coop and Remer to adopt a clothing line; Coop is against it, but Remer agrees and becomes obsessed with his newfound status. After the semifinals, Cain informs Coop and Remer that the clothing line has been produced through [[child labor]] in [[Calcutta]]; if the public finds out, the team and Jenna's foundation will be ruined. Cain blackmails Coop and Remer into losing or forfeiting the Denslow Cup game or he will inform the public. Jenna learns about the scandal and breaks up with Coop as Coop and Remer blame each other for the predicament.\n\nWith their friendship in shambles, Coop goes to Calcutta, aiming to resolve the situation by replacing the child workers with adults. Making it back to the championship game just as it begins, Coop still blames Remer and the Beers perform abysmally; by the seventh-inning stretch, the Beers are down 16\u20130. Having had enough of Coop and Remer's fighting, Squeak gives the stadium an impassioned speech, reminding Coop and Remer where they came from, how much they changed everyone else's lives, and what they risk losing. Moved, Coop and Remer reconcile their differences as Yvette breaks off her alliance with Cain. After shifting their focus back in the game, they are poised to win when Coop's La-Z-Boy pops. Coop is distraught until Joey brings him a new BASEketball made from a [[Barcalounger]]. After a harrowing last throw, they win the Denslow Cup.

{"title_page": "Jonas Greene", "text_new": "'''Sir Jonas Greene''' (1767-1828) was an Irish [[barrister]] and magistrate who held the office of [[Recorder of Dublin]].\n\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], the eldest son of Richard Greene. He was [[called to the Bar]] and in 1822 he was made Recorder of Dublin and [[knighted]]. The Recorder was the chief magistrate for Dublin city, with the overall responsibility for keeping the peace. The office was an onerous one. Greene from the available evidence seems to have been diligent and hard-working. A debate on the duties of the Recorder in the [[English House of Commons]] three years after his death revealed that he held two sessions of his court every week, with extra sessions as the workload required.\n\nHe married in 1790 the popular Dublin [[actress]]  Marianne Hitchcock. She was the daughter of Robert Hitchcock, the author and [[playwright]], best remembered for ''An Historical View of the Irish Stage,'' and his wife Sarah, who like her daughter was a popular actress.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song, which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours, such as singing, to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side-effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]). However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island, high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences, therefore, remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song, which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours, such as singing, to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side-effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]). However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island, high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences, therefore, remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

Pelagius was also highly educated, spoke and wrote Latin and Greek with great fluency, and was well versed in theology.

He blamed this laxity on the theology of [[divine grace]] preached by Augustine, among others. He began to teach a very strict, rigid moralism, emphasizing a natural, innate human ability to attain salvation.<ref name=\"Filippo\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/sfilippo_augustinepelag_jan08.asp|title=St. Augustine and Pelagianism {{!}} Stephen N.

Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''\". With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html|title=Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD|website=www.seanmultimedia.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence, Or cry down Sin Originall, or that The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help.\" However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip.

[[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church.

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''\". With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html|title=Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD|website=www.seanmultimedia.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip.

[[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult.

Melbourne: Fairfax Digital]</ref>\n\nIn [[M J Trow]] and Richard Denham's 'Britannia' series, Pelagius is a character who has a huge moral impact on one of the four central characters, Vitalis, and his take on Christianity resonates throughout the rest of the series.\n\nPelagius is referred to in [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s book, ''The Black Rood''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawhead |first1=Stephen R |title=The black rood |date=2000 |publisher=EOS |location=New York |isbn=9780061050343 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackrood00lawh |accessdate=19 January 2019 |language=English |url-access=registration }}</ref>, and makes an appearance in ''Patrick''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawhead |first1=Stephen R |title=Patrick : Son of Ireland |date=2004 |publisher=HarperTorch |location=New York |isbn=9780060012823 |url=https://archive.org/details/patrick00step |accessdate=19 January 2019 |url-access=registration }}</ref>, where he has a discussion with the Hiberno-British saint.\n\nPelagius is frequently referred to in [[Jack Whyte]]'s series of books known as ''[[A Dream of Eagles]]'', where a major character's belief in Pelagius' ideas of free will and the laxity of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church eventually cause him to come into conflict with Church representatives.\n\n[[John Cowper Powys]]' novel ''[[Porius (A Romance of the Dark Ages)]]'' (1951) features the conflict between Augustinian/Pelagian beliefs, with the eponymous hero being a follower of Pelagius. Powys referred approvingly to Pelagianism in his nonfiction book ''Obstinate Cymric'' (1947).\n\nThe Saint Augustine/Pelagius debate is mockingly discussed in the novel by [[Flann O'Brien]] titled ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'', wherein Saint Augustine actually makes a ghostly appearance.\n\nThe government of the English-speaking Union (Enspun) in [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[The Wanting Seed]]'' is locked in a perpetual cycle, rotating between the 'Pel-Phase', named after Pelagius, and an Augustinian phase. The former is one of police and social services; the latter is characterized by martial law. Burgess took up the Augustine/Pelagius theme again in ''[[The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End|The Clockwork Testament]]'' and in ''[[Earthly Powers]]''.\n\nIn the movie ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004),<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/k/king-arthur-script-transcript.html \"King Arthur\"]</ref> Pelagius is a former mentor of young Lucius Artorius Castus ([[King Arthur|Arthur]]) played by Clive Owen. Arthur champions Pelagius' ideals, particularly those regarding free will. Upon learning of Pelagius's excommunication and death, Arthur realizes that the Roman ideal that he supported no longer exists.  He breaks ties with the [[Roman Empire]], and leads the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] against the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders.\n\nPelagius is the subject of a poem by the [[Glasgow]] poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] (\"Cathures\", Carcanet 2002) which imagines that Pelagius has returned to his native Glasgow (Cathures) and that his Celtic name was Morgan.\n\n[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], in his novel ''[[Emperor (Baxter novel)|Emperor]]'', imagines how time's tapestry would have looked had Pelagius' views and not Augustine's influenced the evolution of Christianity.  He also portrays the Emperor Constantine's actions as having dealt a harsh blow, but not necessarily a mortal one, to Pelagius' teaching that humans are free and sin is not inherent in us.\n\nA facsimile of the 1808 \"A Dissertation of the Pelagian Heresy and the Refutation of it al Llandewi Brevi by St David\" has been printed in [[Carmarthen]] on the same street as the original.\n\n''Heresy: the Life of Pelagius'' (2012) by David Lovejoy, portrays Pelagius through the eyes of his (fictional) servant Arwel.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=794693050&qt=results_page Heresy: the Life of Pelagius by David Lovejoy, Echo Publications]</ref>\n\nIn his [[Sister Fidelma mysteries|Sister Fidelma mystery series]] (1994\u2013present), author Peter Berresford Ellis, under the pen name Peter Tremayne, uses the teachings of Pelagius to contrast the dogma and practices of the contemporary Celtic church and that of Rome for supremacy in the British Isles.\n\n== Writings==\nPelagius wrote: ''De fide Trinitatis libri \u2162'' (\"On Faith in the Trinity: Three Books\"), ''Eclogarum ex divinis Scripturis liber primus'' (\"Excerpts out of Divine Scriptures: Book One\"), and ''Commentarii in epistolas S. Pauli'' (\"Commentary on the Epistles of Saint Paul\").  Unfortunately, most of his work survives only in the quotations of his opponents.

physically uncommon and technically astute way. Her pure, precise soprano is warm without burr or melisma, its mellow sweetness never saccharine or showy\".<ref name=\"Vice\"/> In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jon Pareles]] said the singer's voice \"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced. \u2026 Ms. Grande sails above any fray, past or present.

But they make the rest of this album seem formulaic.\" He considered the album \"uneven\", with its attempts to balance out what Grande called a \"weird\" record. Petridis felt that \"the world could use more pop music as imaginative as ''Sweetener''{{'}}s highlights.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\" />\n\n[[Neil McCormick]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' felt that \"the quality of the songs is high, although there are moments when they might be trying too hard to demonstrate that the teen queen is all grown up now,\" and argued, \"as modern, branded, blockbuster pop albums go, ''Sweetener'' is a delightful confection.\" He commented less favorably about guest rappers Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliott, who \"sound like they dialled in clich\u00e9d verses for a pay cheque.\"<ref name=\"the telegraph\" />\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Awards\n|-\n!

The album would later be certified platinum by the [[RIAA]]. It also topped several international album charts, including in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. ''Sweetener'' won [[Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]], marking the first Grammy Award win of Grande's career.\n\nThe album has spawned three top-twenty singles in the United States. The lead single, \"[[No Tears Left to Cry]]\" debuted and peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"[[The Light Is Coming]]\", featuring Minaj, was released as a promotional single along with the pre-order of the album. The second single, \"[[God Is a Woman]]\" peaked at number eight, while the third single \"[[Breathin]]\" debuted at number 22 following the album release and later peaked at number 12. Grande embarked on a series of concerts entitled [[The Sweetener Sessions]] to promote the album. In support of both ''Sweetener'' and her fifth studio album, ''[[Thank U, Next]]'', Grande embarked on the [[Sweetener World Tour]], which began on March 18, 2019 and concluded on December 22, 2019.\n\n==Background and recording==\nOn November 13, 2016, Grande stated on [[Snapchat]] that she had finished her fourth album.

Antidotes for anticoagulants are sometimes referred to as '''reversal agents'''.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=4899056 | pmid=27330657 | doi=10.5811/westjem.2016.3.29294 | volume=17 | issue=3 | title=Anticoagulation Reversal and Treatment Strategies in Major Bleeding: Update 2016 | year=2016 | author=Christos S, Naples R | journal=West J Emerg Med | pages=264\u201370}}</ref>\n\nThe antidotes for some particular [[toxins]] are manufactured by injecting the toxin into an animal in small doses and extracting the resulting [[antibody|antibodies]] from the host animals' blood. This results in an [[antivenom]] that can be used to counteract [[venom (poison)|venom]] produced by certain species of [[snake]]s, [[spider]]s, and other venomous animals. Some animal venoms, especially those produced by [[arthropod]]s (such as certain [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[bee]]s) are only potentially lethal when they provoke allergic reactions and induce [[anaphylactic shock]]; as such, there is no \"antidote\" for these venoms; however anaphylactic shock can be treated (e.g. with [[epinephrine]]).\n\nSome other toxins have no known antidote. For example, the poison [[aconitine]] &ndash; a highly poisonous [[alkaloid]] derived from various [[aconitum|aconite species]] &ndash; has no antidote, and as a result, is often fatal if it enters the human body in sufficient quantities.\n\n==Mechanical approaches==\nIngested poisons are frequently treated by the oral administration of [[activated charcoal]], which [[adsorption|absorb]]s the poison and flushes it from the digestive tract, thereby removing a large part of the toxin. \nPoisons which are injected into the body (such as those from bites or stings from venomous animals) are usually treated by the use of a constriction band which limits the flow of lymph and/or blood to the area, thus slowing the circulation of the poison around the body.

This results in an [[antivenom]] that can be used to counteract [[venom (poison)|venom]] produced by certain species of [[snake]]s, [[spider]]s, and other venomous animals. Some animal venoms, especially those produced by [[arthropod]]s (such as certain [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[bee]]s) are only potentially lethal when they provoke allergic reactions and induce [[anaphylactic shock]]; as such, there is no \"antidote\" for these venoms; however anaphylactic shock can be treated (e.g. with [[epinephrine]]).\n\nSome other toxins have no known antidote. For example, the poison [[aconitine]] &ndash; a highly poisonous [[alkaloid]] derived from various [[aconitum|aconite species]] &ndash; has no antidote, and as a result, is often fatal if it enters the human body in sufficient quantities.\n\n==Mechanical approaches==\nIngested poisons are frequently treated by the oral administration of [[activated charcoal]], which [[adsorption|absorb]]s the poison and flushes it from the digestive tract, thereby removing a large part of the toxin. \nPoisons which are injected into the body (such as those from bites or stings from venomous animals) are usually treated by the use of a constriction band which limits the flow of lymph and/or blood to the area, thus slowing the circulation of the poison around the body.  This should not be confused with the use of a [[tourniquet]] which cuts off blood flow completely &ndash; often leading to the loss of the limb.\n\n== Techniques to identify antidotes ==\nIn early 2019, a group of researchers in Australia published the finding of a new [[box jellyfish]] venom antidote using [[CRISPR]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://the-crispr.com/antidote-to-deadly-jellyfish-identified-using-crispr/|title=Antidote to deadly jellyfish identified using CRISPR|last=The-Crispr|date=2019-05-13|website=The Crispr|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> The technology had been used to functionally inactivate genes in human cell lines and identify the peripheral membrane protein [[ATP2B1]], a calcium transporting ATPase, as one host factor required for box jellyfish venom [[cytotoxicity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neely|first=G.

She is one of Finland\u2019s most-cherished modernist painters. She is most widely known for her [[Realism (arts)|realist]] works and self-portraits, and less well known for her landscapes and still lifes. Throughout her long life, her work changed dramatically beginning with French-influenced realism and plein air painting. It gradually evolved towards portraits and still life paintings.  At the beginning of her career she often produced historical paintings, such as the Wounded Warrior in the Snow (1880), At the Door of Link\u00f6ping Jail in 1600 (1882) and The Death of Wilhelm von Schwerin (1886). Historical paintings were usually the realm of male painters, as was the experimentation with modern influences and French radical naturalism. As a result, her works produced mostly in the 1880s did not receive a favourable reception until later in her life. <ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/4115 | author =Konttinen, Riitta |title= Schjerfbeck, Helene (1862\u20131946)  |date= 16 September 1997 |website= Biografiakeskus |publisher= Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura | language = English | access-date=16 October 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Her work starts with a dazzlingly skilled, somewhat melancholic version of late-19th-century academic realism\u2026it ends with distilled, nearly abstract images in which pure paint and cryptic description are held in perfect balance.''

She showed talent at an early age, and, in 1873, by the time she was eleven she was enrolled at the [[Finnish Art Society]] School of Drawing, where her fees were paid by [[Adolf von Becker]], who saw promise in her.<ref>Ahtola-Moorhouse, Lena: 'Schjerfbeck, Helene [Helena] (Sofia)'</ref> At this school  Schjerfbeck met [[Helena Westermarck]].

A little over a year after her father's death, Schjerfbeck graduated from the Finnish Art Society drawing school. She continued her education, with Westermarck, at a private academy run by Adolf von Becker, which utilised the [[University of Helsinki]] drawing studio. Professor G. Asp paid for her tuition to Becker's private academy. There, Becker himself taught her French [[oil painting]] techniques.\n\nIn 1879, at the age of 17, Schjerfbeck won third prize in a competition organised by the Finnish Art Society, and in 1880 her work was displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition. That summer Schjerfbeck spent time at a manor owned by her aunt on her mother's side, Selma Printz, and Selma's husband Thomas Adlercreutz. There she spent time drawing and painting her cousins. Schjerfbeck became particularly close to her cousin Selma Adlercreutz, who was her age. She set off to [[Paris]] later that year after receiving a travel grant from the Imperial Russian Senate.\n\n==Career==\nIn Paris, Schjerfbeck painted with Helena Westermarck, then left to study with [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]] at Mme Tr\u00e9lat de Vigny's studio. In 1881 she moved to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], where she studied once again with Westermarck. The Imperial Senate gave her another scholarship, which she used to spend a couple of months in [[Meudon]], and then a few more months in [[Concarneau]], Brittany. She then went back to the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi briefly, before returning to the Adlercreutz family manor in Finland. Schjerfbeck continued to move around frequently, painting and studying with various people. Schjerfbeck made money by continuing to put her paintings in the Art Society's exhibitions, and she also did illustrations for books. In 1884 she was back in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi with Westermarck, but this time they were working there. She was given more money to travel by a man from the Finnish Art Society and in 1887 she traveled to [[St Ives, Cornwall]], in Britain.<ref name=\"KB\"/> There she painted ''The Convalescent'', which won the bronze medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris World Fair]]. The painting was later bought by the Finnish Art Society. During this period Schjerfbeck was painting in a naturalistic plein-air style.\n\nIn the 1890s Schjerfbeck started teaching regularly in Finland at the Art Society drawing school, but in 1901 she became too ill to teach and in 1902 she resigned her post. She moved to [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], all while taking care of her mother who lived with her (the mother died in 1923). While living in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, she continued to paint and exhibit.<ref name=\"NY\"/> \"Schjerfbeck\u2019s sole contact with the art world was through magazines sent by friends.\"<ref>[[Facos, Michelle]]. 'Helene Schjerfbeck\u2019s Self-Portraits', in ''Woman\u2019s Art Journal''; 16 (Spring 1995): 12-7.</ref> Since she did not have art, Schjerfbeck took up hobbies like reading and embroidery.\n\nDuring this time Schjerbeck produced [[still life]]s and [[landscape]]s, as well as portraits, such as that of her mother, local school girls and women workers, and also self-portraits, and she became a [[Modernist Painting|modernist painter]]. Her work has been compared to that of artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Edvard Munch]],<ref name=\"NY\"/> but from 1905 her paintings took on a character that was hers alone. She continued experimenting with various techniques such as using different types of [[underpainting]].\n\nIn 1913 Schjerfbeck met the art-dealer G\u00f6sta Stenman, with whose encouragement she exhibited at [[Malm\u00f6]] in 1914, [[Stockholm]] in 1916 and [[St Petersburg]] in 1917. In 1917 Stenman organised her first solo exhibition and in that year Einar Reuter (alias H. Ahtela) published the first Schjerfbeck monograph. Later she exhibited at Copenhagen (1919), Gothenburg (1923) and Stockholm (1934). In 1937 Stenman organised another solo exhibition for her in Stockholm,<ref name=\"NY\"/> and in 1938 he began paying her a monthly stipend.\n\n== Later years and death ==\nAs the years passed, Schjerfbeck travelled less. When a family matter arose, such as a death, she would travel back to her home city of Helsinki and she spent most of 1920 in [[Eken\u00e4s (Finland)|Eken\u00e4s]], but by 1921 she was back living in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4.\n\nFor about a year, Schjerfbeck moved to a farm in [[Tenala]] to get away from the [[Winter War]], but went back to Eken\u00e4s in the middle of 1940. She later moved into a nursing home, where she resided for less than a year before moving to the Luontola sanatorium. In 1944 she moved into the [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]] spa hotel in [[Sweden]], where she continued to paint actively even during her last years; e.g. the series of self-portraits.<ref name=\"KB\"/>\nShe died on January 23, 1946 and was buried at the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa\u2013 merkitt\u00e4vi\u00e4 vainajia|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf ||publisher= Kirkko Helsingiss\u00e4 |access-date= November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:Tanssiaiskengat iso by Helena Schjerfbeck 1882.jpg|thumb|''Dancing Shoes''.

The subject was so popular that Schjerfbeck returned to the theme three times as well as executing a lithograph of it, the latter catapulting the painting to international fame. It depicts her cousin Esther Lupander. Esther had extremely long legs and for that reason the painting was nicknamed \"The Grasshopper\". Executed in [[Realism (art)|Realist]] style, the painting shows the clear influence of Schjerfbeck's stay in Paris where she had expressed admiration for [[Edouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Berthe Morisot]], and [[Mary Cassatt]].

She is one of Finland\u2019s most-cherished modernist painters. She is most widely known for her [[Realism (arts)|realist]] works and self-portraits, and less well known for her landscapes and still lifes. Throughout her long life, her work changed dramatically beginning with French-influenced realism and plein air painting. It gradually evolved towards portraits and still life paintings.  At the beginning of her career she often produced historical paintings, such as the Wounded Warrior in the Snow (1880), At the Door of Link\u00f6ping Jail in 1600 (1882) and The Death of Wilhelm von Schwerin (1886). Historical paintings were usually the realm of male painters, as was the experimentation with modern influences and French radical naturalism. As a result, her works produced mostly in the 1880s did not receive a favourable reception until later in her life. <ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/4115 | author =Konttinen, Riitta |title= Schjerfbeck, Helene (1862\u20131946)  |date= 16 September 1997 |website= Biografiakeskus |publisher= Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura | language = English | access-date=16 October 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Her work starts with a dazzlingly skilled, somewhat melancholic version of late-19th-century academic realism\u2026it ends with distilled, nearly abstract images in which pure paint and cryptic description are held in perfect balance.''

A little over a year after her father's death, Schjerfbeck graduated from the Finnish Art Society drawing school. She continued her education, with Westermarck, at a private academy run by Adolf von Becker, which utilised the [[University of Helsinki]] drawing studio. Professor G. Asp paid for her tuition to Becker's private academy. There, Becker himself taught her French [[oil painting]] techniques.\n\nIn 1879, at the age of 17, Schjerfbeck won third prize in a competition organised by the Finnish Art Society, and in 1880 her work was displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition. That summer Schjerfbeck spent time at a manor owned by her aunt on her mother's side, Selma Printz, and Selma's husband Thomas Adlercreutz. There she spent time drawing and painting her cousins. Schjerfbeck became particularly close to her cousin Selma Adlercreutz, who was her age. She set off to [[Paris]] later that year after receiving a travel grant from the Imperial Russian Senate.\n\n==Career==\nIn Paris, Schjerfbeck painted with Helena Westermarck, then left to study with [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]] at Mme Tr\u00e9lat de Vigny's studio. In 1881 she moved to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi]], where she studied once again with Westermarck. The Imperial Senate gave her another scholarship, which she used to spend a couple of months in [[Meudon]], and then a few more months in [[Concarneau]], Brittany. She then went back to the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi briefly, before returning to the Adlercreutz family manor in Finland. Schjerfbeck continued to move around frequently, painting and studying with various people. Schjerfbeck made money by continuing to put her paintings in the Art Society's exhibitions, and she also did illustrations for books. In 1884 she was back in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi with Westermarck, but this time they were working there. She was given more money to travel by a man from the Finnish Art Society and in 1887 she traveled to [[St Ives, Cornwall]], in Britain.<ref name=\"KB\"/> There she painted ''The Convalescent'', which won the bronze medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris World Fair]]. The painting was later bought by the Finnish Art Society. During this period Schjerfbeck was painting in a naturalistic plein-air style.\n\nIn the 1890s Schjerfbeck started teaching regularly in Finland at the Art Society drawing school, but in 1901 she became too ill to teach and in 1902 she resigned her post. She moved to [[Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4]], all while taking care of her mother who lived with her (the mother died in 1923). While living in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, she continued to paint and exhibit.<ref name=\"NY\"/> \"Schjerfbeck\u2019s sole contact with the art world was through magazines sent by friends.\"<ref>[[Facos, Michelle]]. 'Helene Schjerfbeck\u2019s Self-Portraits', in ''Woman\u2019s Art Journal''; 16 (Spring 1995): 12-7.</ref> Since she did not have art, Schjerfbeck took up hobbies like reading and embroidery.\n\nDuring this time Schjerbeck produced [[still life]]s and [[landscape]]s, as well as portraits, such as that of her mother, local school girls and women workers, and also self-portraits, and she became a [[Modernist Painting|modernist painter]]. Her work has been compared to that of artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Edvard Munch]],<ref name=\"NY\"/> but from 1905 her paintings took on a character that was hers alone. She continued experimenting with various techniques such as using different types of [[underpainting]].\n\nIn 1913 Schjerfbeck met the art-dealer G\u00f6sta Stenman, with whose encouragement she exhibited at [[Malm\u00f6]] in 1914, [[Stockholm]] in 1916 and [[St Petersburg]] in 1917. In 1917 Stenman organised her first solo exhibition and in that year Einar Reuter (alias H. Ahtela) published the first Schjerfbeck monograph. Later she exhibited at Copenhagen (1919), Gothenburg (1923) and Stockholm (1934). In 1937 Stenman organised another solo exhibition for her in Stockholm,<ref name=\"NY\"/> and in 1938 he began paying her a monthly stipend.\n\n== Later years and death ==\nAs the years passed, Schjerfbeck travelled less. When a family matter arose, such as a death, she would travel back to her home city of Helsinki and she spent most of 1920 in [[Eken\u00e4s (Finland)|Eken\u00e4s]], but by 1921 she was back living in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4.\n\nFor about a year, Schjerfbeck moved to a farm in [[Tenala]] to get away from the [[Winter War]], but went back to Eken\u00e4s in the middle of 1940. She later moved into a nursing home, where she resided for less than a year before moving to the Luontola sanatorium. In 1944 she moved into the [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]] spa hotel in [[Sweden]], where she continued to paint actively even during her last years; e.g. the series of self-portraits.<ref name=\"KB\"/>\nShe died on January 23, 1946 and was buried at the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa\u2013 merkitt\u00e4vi\u00e4 vainajia|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf ||publisher= Kirkko Helsingiss\u00e4 |access-date= November 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n[[File:Tanssiaiskengat iso by Helena Schjerfbeck 1882.jpg|thumb|''Dancing Shoes''.  Oil on canvas, 1882]]\n''Dancing Shoes'' is one of Schjerfbeck's most enduringly popular paintings. The subject was so popular that Schjerfbeck returned to the theme three times as well as executing a lithograph of it, the latter catapulting the painting to international fame. It depicts her cousin Esther Lupander. Esther had extremely long legs and for that reason the painting was nicknamed \"The Grasshopper\". Executed in [[Realism (art)|Realist]] style, the painting shows the clear influence of Schjerfbeck's stay in Paris where she had expressed admiration for [[Edouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Berthe Morisot]], and [[Mary Cassatt]]. It fetched \u00a33,044,500 at a 2008 Sotheby's London sale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dancing Shoes|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/the-scandinavian-sale-l08104/lot.219.html|publisher=[[Sotheby's]]}}</ref>\n\n''Girl with Blonde Hair'' (1916) is an example of Schjerfbeck's mature style, drawing on [[Modernism#The beginnings of Modernism in France|French Modernism]]. The work belongs to a series (including also ''The Family Heirloom'' of the same year) featuring neighbours of Schjerfbeck, Jenny and Impi Tamlander, who ran errands for Schjerfbeck and her mother and helped look after the family home. Here the sitter is Impi.
