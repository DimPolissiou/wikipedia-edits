He would also tour in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).\n\nWrestling as The Tasmaniac, Senerchia had his first [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) match on August 19, 1991, when he was defeated by [[Ray Odyssey]]. Appearing as The Tazmaniac, he then made his only appearance ever in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) when he defeated [[Joey Maggs]] in a dark match at a ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'' taping in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on February 8, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm |title=WCW 1993 |publisher=Thehistoryofwwe.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-22}}</ref> He would then make his second appearance in the WWF on May 5, 1993.

He held the title once more, this time with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], until Sabu was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] fired by ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] for [[No-show (professional wrestling)|no-showing]] an event in favor of touring Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\">{{cite video|date=November 16, 2004|title=[[The Rise and Fall of ECW|Rise and Fall of ECW, The]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> In August 1994, The Tazmaniac competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Shane Douglas]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book|author=Scott E.

On July 15, during a tag team match [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and [[Dean Malenko]] delivered a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|spike piledriver]] to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', \"I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.\" The neck injury was so bad that, according to [[Tommy Dreamer]], hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (1995\u20131996) ====\nFollowing his neck injury, Taz made appearances with [[The Steiner Brothers]], even standing in their corner during matches with [[The Eliminators]] and getting physical with [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. It was at the [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee [[Bill Alfonso]]. Working as the special referee for Alfonso's match with ECW commissioner [[Tod Gordon]], Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the [[kayfabe]] story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family's table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.\n\nTaz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black/orange [[wiktionary:singlet|singlet]] and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and [[suplex]]es (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer [[Joey Styles]] dubbed ''[[#In wrestling|Taz-Plexes]]'', earning him the nickname \"The Human Suplex Machine\". He also debuted his ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Half nelson choke|Tazmission]]''/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to [[Submission (combat sport)|tap out]] to signal their submission as in [[mixed martial arts]] instead of nodding their head or vocally saying \"yes\". This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country.<ref>{{cite episode|title=12/17/95|series=History of ECW|network=[[WWE Classics On Demand]]| airdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to face Dreamer and [[Terry Gordy]] and later Dreamer and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. [[Perry Saturn]] and Taz were both trainers at ECW's [[House of Hardcore]] wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and [[Chris Chetti]], would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\nAt [[November to Remember (1996)|November to Remember]], things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and \"stole Paul E.'s thunder\" by announcing that there would be a \"big show in the first quarter of the new year\", basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW's first [[pay-per-view]] was on the horizon. At that \"big show\", he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a \"Sabu, Sabu\" chant to get him to enter the ring.  Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.\n\nDuring Sabu's match, where he teamed with [[Rob Van Dam]] to face The Eliminators and [[The Gangstas]] in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with ''Total Elimination'' and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.\n\n==== World Television Champion (1997\u20131998) ====\nEarly in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu's partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW's [[ECW Barely Legal|first pay-per-view]], Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the ''Tazmission'' due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], where Taz defeated him with the ''Tazmission'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal 1997 results| accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> only to have his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bill Alfonso]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and join Sabu and his partner [[Rob Van Dam]].<ref name=\"slambio\"/> In response, Taz began teaming with [[Chris Candido]] to face Sabu and Van Dam.\n\nTwo months later at [[Wrestlepalooza (1997)|Wrestlepalooza]], Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from [[Shane Douglas]] to begin his second reign.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, [[Lance Storm]], [[John Kronus]], [[Al Snow]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Chris Candido]]. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] during the feud. At [[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]], he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] at [[Living Dangerously (1998)|Living Dangerously]] on March 1, 1998.\n\nAfter losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange\u2014his trademark color\u2014and began [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cutting promos]], declaring himself the [[ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship|FTW Heavyweight Champion]] at [[It Ain't Seinfeld]]. Though the championship was unsanctioned [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], it was defended at ECW shows until Douglas was healthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998c.html#080298|title=Heat Wave 1998 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Just before winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Taz \"gave\" the FTW Heavyweight Title to long-time foe Sabu in a match where he physically pulled Sabu on top of him to allow him to get the pin.<ref name=\"SolieFTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ftwecw.html|title=Fuck The World title history|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion and departure (1999) ====\nTaz finally defeated Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Guilty as Charged (1999)|Guilty as Charged]], thus ending Douglas' year-long reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011099|title=Guilty as Charged 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz was supposed to defend the title against [[Chris Candido]] in his first televised title defense at [[House Party (1999)|House Party]] but Douglas attacked Candido before the match and took his place, whom Taz defeated to retain the title in his first successful title defense. He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz's World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu's FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the [[Living Dangerously (1999)|Living Dangerously]] pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship. He would begin his next rivalry with Chris Candido, whom he defeated to retain the title at [[CyberSlam (1999)|CyberSlam]]. The two were scheduled to a rematch at [[Hardcore Heaven (1999)|Hardcore Heaven]], which Taz quickly won. However, he was attacked by [[Dudley Boyz]] after the match, leading to a title defense against [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Buh Buh Ray Dudley]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|falls count anywhere match]] in the main event later that night, which Taz won to retain the title. Taz then successfully defended the title against Candido on the June 4 episode of ''Hardcore TV'' to end the rivalry.\n\nTaz made his next successful title defense against [[Spike Dudley]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the June 25 episode of ''Hardcore TV''. He would begin feuding with the members of [[Steve Corino]]'s [[The Network (professional wrestling)|new rising stable]], primarily [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]]. Taz successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri at [[Hostile City Showdown (1999)|Hostile City Showdown]], the [[Heat Wave (1999)|Heat Wave]] pay-per-view and the September 3 episode of ''[[ECW on TNN]]''. During that time, Taz signed with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], losing the title as the first man eliminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three-way dance]] at [[Anarchy Rulz (1999)|Anarchy Rulz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999c.html#091999|title=Anarchy Rulz 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> This ended his eight-month reign at 252 days. As he walked out of the ring, a large portion of the ECW locker room joined him on the entrance ramp to give him an emotional sendoff. After being off of ECW television for most of the fall, he wrestled one final match as an ECW performer at [[November to Remember (1999)|November to Remember]], losing to [[Rob Van Dam]] via [[Pin (wrestling)|pinfall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999d.html#110799|title=November to Remember 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz's final televised match in ECW aired on the November 13 episode of ''Hardcore TV'', in which he received a rematch against Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost.

He held the title once more, this time with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], until Sabu was [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimately]] fired by ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] for [[No-show (professional wrestling)|no-showing]] an event in favor of touring Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\">{{cite video|date=November 16, 2004|title=[[The Rise and Fall of ECW|Rise and Fall of ECW, The]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> In August 1994, The Tazmaniac competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[Shane Douglas]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book|author=Scott E.

On July 15, during a tag team match [[2 Cold Scorpio]] and [[Dean Malenko]] delivered a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided piledriver|spike piledriver]] to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary ''[[The Rise and Fall of ECW]]'', \"I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.\" The neck injury was so bad that, according to [[Tommy Dreamer]], hospital staff couldn't believe he'd walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\n==== Rise to superstardom (1995\u20131996) ====\nFollowing his neck injury, Taz made appearances with [[The Steiner Brothers]], even standing in their corner during matches with [[The Eliminators]] and getting physical with [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. It was at the [[November to Remember (1995)|November to Remember]] event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee [[Bill Alfonso]]. Working as the special referee for Alfonso's match with ECW commissioner [[Tod Gordon]], Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the [[kayfabe]] story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family's table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.\n\nTaz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black/orange [[wiktionary:singlet|singlet]] and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and [[suplex]]es (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer [[Joey Styles]] dubbed ''[[#In wrestling|Taz-Plexes]]'', earning him the nickname \"The Human Suplex Machine\". He also debuted his ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Half nelson choke|Tazmission]]''/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to [[Submission (combat sport)|tap out]] to signal their submission as in [[mixed martial arts]] instead of nodding their head or vocally saying \"yes\". This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country.<ref>{{cite episode|title=12/17/95|series=History of ECW|network=[[WWE Classics On Demand]]| airdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to face Dreamer and [[Terry Gordy]] and later Dreamer and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]]. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. [[Perry Saturn]] and Taz were both trainers at ECW's [[House of Hardcore]] wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and [[Chris Chetti]], would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.<ref name=\"Houseofhardcore\"/>\n\nAt [[November to Remember (1996)|November to Remember]], things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and \"stole Paul E.'s thunder\" by announcing that there would be a \"big show in the first quarter of the new year\", basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW's first [[pay-per-view]] was on the horizon. At that \"big show\", he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a \"Sabu, Sabu\" chant to get him to enter the ring.  Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.\n\nDuring Sabu's match, where he teamed with [[Rob Van Dam]] to face The Eliminators and [[The Gangstas]] in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with ''Total Elimination'' and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.\n\n==== World Television Champion (1997\u20131998) ====\nEarly in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu's partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW's [[ECW Barely Legal|first pay-per-view]], Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the ''Tazmission'' due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], where Taz defeated him with the ''Tazmission'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1997b.html#041397|title=Barely Legal 1997 results| accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> only to have his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Bill Alfonso]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on him and join Sabu and his partner [[Rob Van Dam]].<ref name=\"slambio\"/> In response, Taz began teaming with [[Chris Candido]] to face Sabu and Van Dam.\n\nTwo months later at [[Wrestlepalooza (1997)|Wrestlepalooza]], Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from [[Shane Douglas]] to begin his second reign.<ref name=\"WT-ECWTV\"/> He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, [[Lance Storm]], [[John Kronus]], [[Al Snow]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Chris Candido]]. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] during the feud. At [[November to Remember (1997)|November to Remember]], he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] at [[Living Dangerously (1998)|Living Dangerously]] on March 1, 1998.\n\nAfter losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange\u2014his trademark color\u2014and began [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cutting promos]], declaring himself the [[ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship|FTW Heavyweight Champion]] at [[It Ain't Seinfeld]]. Though the championship was unsanctioned [[Kayfabe|in storyline]], it was defended at ECW shows until Douglas was healthy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1998c.html#080298|title=Heat Wave 1998 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Just before winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Taz \"gave\" the FTW Heavyweight Title to long-time foe Sabu in a match where he physically pulled Sabu on top of him to allow him to get the pin.<ref name=\"SolieFTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ftwecw.html|title=Fuck The World title history|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion and departure (1999) ====\nTaz finally defeated Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Guilty as Charged (1999)|Guilty as Charged]], thus ending Douglas' year-long reign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999a.html#011099|title=Guilty as Charged 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz was supposed to defend the title against [[Chris Candido]] in his first televised title defense at [[House Party (1999)|House Party]] but Douglas attacked Candido before the match and took his place, whom Taz defeated to retain the title in his first successful title defense. He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz's World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu's FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the [[Living Dangerously (1999)|Living Dangerously]] pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship. He would begin his next rivalry with Chris Candido, whom he defeated to retain the title at [[CyberSlam (1999)|CyberSlam]]. The two were scheduled to a rematch at [[Hardcore Heaven (1999)|Hardcore Heaven]], which Taz quickly won. However, he was attacked by [[Dudley Boyz]] after the match, leading to a title defense against [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Buh Buh Ray Dudley]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|falls count anywhere match]] in the main event later that night, which Taz won to retain the title. Taz then successfully defended the title against Candido on the June 4 episode of ''Hardcore TV'' to end the rivalry.\n\nTaz made his next successful title defense against [[Spike Dudley]] in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the June 25 episode of ''Hardcore TV''. He would begin feuding with the members of [[Steve Corino]]'s [[The Network (professional wrestling)|new rising stable]], primarily [[Yoshihiro Tajiri]]. Taz successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri at [[Hostile City Showdown (1999)|Hostile City Showdown]], the [[Heat Wave (1999)|Heat Wave]] pay-per-view and the September 3 episode of ''[[ECW on TNN]]''. During that time, Taz signed with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], losing the title as the first man eliminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three-way dance]] at [[Anarchy Rulz (1999)|Anarchy Rulz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999c.html#091999|title=Anarchy Rulz 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher= Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> This ended his eight-month reign at 252 days. As he walked out of the ring, a large portion of the ECW locker room joined him on the entrance ramp to give him an emotional sendoff. After being off of ECW television for most of the fall, he wrestled one final match as an ECW performer at [[November to Remember (1999)|November to Remember]], losing to [[Rob Van Dam]] via [[Pin (wrestling)|pinfall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1999d.html#110799|title=November to Remember 1999 results|accessdate=July 22, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref> Taz's final televised match in ECW aired on the November 13 episode of ''Hardcore TV'', in which he received a rematch against Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost.

Normally, a [[deep fryer]] or [[chip pan]] is used for this; industrially, a [[pressure fryer]] or [[vacuum fryer]] may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot.<!--<ref name=\"Tsuji 2007\"/> on PAGE 230, see the Tools section for other refs--> Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method.<ref name=\"Stanley Thornes 1996 p. 18\"/><ref name=\"America 2007 p. 86\"/> Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has a high rate of heat conduction.<ref name=\"Sumnu Sahin 2008 p. 6\"/>\n\nThe term \"deep frying\" and many modern deep-fried foods were not invented until the 19th century, but the practice has been around for millennia. Early records and cookbooks suggest that the practice began in certain European countries before other countries adopted the practice.\n\nDeep frying is popular worldwide, with deep-fried foods accounting for a large portion of global caloric consumption. Many foods are deep-fried and cultures surrounding deep frying have developed, most notably in the [[Southern United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where many events and records are held relating to deep frying food and non-edible items.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Peixinhos da horta.jpg|thumb|left|225px|alt=Pieces of bell pepper in a thin bubbly batter|''[[Peixinhos da horta]]'', the Portuguese ancestor of Japanese [[tempura]]]]\nThe English expression ''deep-fried'' is attested from the early 20th century.<ref>\n\"deep-fried\" (1916), \"deep-frying\" (1932),  \"to deep-fry\" (1933)  {{cite web|title=\"deep\", adj.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48625|website=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 May 2015|url-access=subscription }}\n{{cite web|title=\"deep\", v.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48626|website=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 May 2015|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nFrying food in [[olive oil]] is attested in [[Classical Greece]] from about the 5th century BCE.<ref name=cooksinfo>{{cite web|title=Deep-Fried Foods|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/deep-fried-foods|website=cooksinfo.com|publisher=Cooks Info|accessdate=18 May 2015}}\n\"The ancient Greeks began frying foods in olive oil sometime around or after the 5th century BC.

One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of [[batter (cooking)|batter]] around the food, such as cornmeal, flour, or [[tempura]]; breadcrumbs may also be used.<ref name=\"SomeGoodDeepFriedNYTimesTAFI\"/> After the food is submerged in oil, the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes [[Maillard reaction]]s which break down sugars and proteins, creating the golden brown exterior of the food. Once the surface is dehydrated, it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption. The heat conducts throughout the food causing [[proteins]] to [[Denaturation (food)|denature]], [[starches]] to undergo [[starch gelatinization]], and [[dietary fiber]] to soften.<ref name=finecookingscience>{{cite web|last1=Joachim|first1=David|last2=Schloss|first2=Andrew|title=The Science of Frying|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/48328/the-science-of-frying|website=finecooking.com|publisher=Fine Cooking|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile most foods need batter coatings for protection, it is not as necessary for cooked noodles and potatoes because their high starch content enables them to hold more moisture and resist shrinking.

These conditions can induce a series of complex chemical reactions which may impact the quality of both the food and the oil it is cooked in. Examples of different chemical reactions include the production of [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], [[Redox|oxidation]], hydrolysis, [[isomerization]] and [[polymerization]]. The exact reactions are dependent upon factors such as the oil type, frying conditions, and food being cooked. When frying, water can attack the ester linkage of triacylglycerols, resulting in di- and monoglycerols, glycerol, and free fatty acids (a type of [[hydrolysis]] reaction). The aforementioned hydrolysis reaction is enhanced by the produced [[fatty acid]]s and other low molecular weight acid compounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mariod|first=Abdalbasit|last2=Omer|first2=Nuha|last3=Al|first3=El Mugdad|first4=Mohammed|last4=Mokhtar |date=2014-09-09|title=Chemical Reactions Taken Place During deep-fat Frying and Their Products: A review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270727167_Chemical_Reactions_Taken_Place_During_deep-fat_Frying_and_Their_Products_A_review|journal=Sudan University of Science & Technology SUST Journal of Natural and Medical Sciences|volume=Supplementary issue|pages=1\u201317|via=}}</ref>\n\nOverheating or over-using the frying oil leads to formation of [[Rancidification|rancid-tasting]] products of [[redox|oxidation]], [[polymerization]], and other deleterious, unintended or even toxic compounds<ref>{{cite book | title=Household use of solid fuels and high-temperature frying | publisher=Lyon, France : International Agency for Research on Cancer ; Distributed by WHO Press, 2010. | author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | year=2010 | location=Lyon, France ; Geneva}}</ref> such as [[acrylamide]] (from [[starch]]y foods).

Many foods are deep-fried and cultures surrounding deep frying have developed, most notably in the [[Southern United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where many events and records are held relating to deep frying food and non-edible items.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Peixinhos da horta.jpg|thumb|left|225px|alt=Pieces of bell pepper in a thin bubbly batter|''[[Peixinhos da horta]]'', the Portuguese ancestor of Japanese [[tempura]]]]\nThe English expression ''deep-fried'' is attested from the early 20th century.<ref>\n\"deep-fried\" (1916), \"deep-frying\" (1932),  \"to deep-fry\" (1933)  {{cite web|title=\"deep\", adj.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48625|website=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 May 2015|url-access=subscription }}\n{{cite web|title=\"deep\", v.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/48626|website=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 May 2015|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nFrying food in [[olive oil]] is attested in [[Classical Greece]] from about the 5th century BCE.<ref name=cooksinfo>{{cite web|title=Deep-Fried Foods|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/deep-fried-foods|website=cooksinfo.com|publisher=Cooks Info|accessdate=18 May 2015}}\n\"The ancient Greeks began frying foods in olive oil sometime around or after the 5th century BC.

One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of [[batter (cooking)|batter]] around the food, such as cornmeal, flour, or [[tempura]]; breadcrumbs may also be used.<ref name=\"SomeGoodDeepFriedNYTimesTAFI\"/> After the food is submerged in oil, the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes [[Maillard reaction]]s which break down sugars and proteins, creating the golden brown exterior of the food. Once the surface is dehydrated, it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption. The heat conducts throughout the food causing [[proteins]] to [[Denaturation (food)|denature]], [[starches]] to undergo [[starch gelatinization]], and [[dietary fiber]] to soften.<ref name=finecookingscience>{{cite web|last1=Joachim|first1=David|last2=Schloss|first2=Andrew|title=The Science of Frying|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/48328/the-science-of-frying|website=finecooking.com|publisher=Fine Cooking|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile most foods need batter coatings for protection, it is not as necessary for cooked noodles and potatoes because their high starch content enables them to hold more moisture and resist shrinking.

These conditions can induce a series of complex chemical reactions which may impact the quality of both the food and the oil it is cooked in. Examples of different chemical reactions include the production of [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], [[Redox|oxidation]], hydrolysis, [[isomerization]] and [[polymerization]]. The exact reactions are dependent upon factors such as the oil type, frying conditions, and food being cooked. When frying, water can attack the ester linkage of triacylglycerols, resulting in di- and monoglycerols, glycerol, and free fatty acids (a type of [[hydrolysis]] reaction). The aforementioned hydrolysis reaction is enhanced by the produced [[fatty acid]]s and other low molecular weight acid compounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mariod|first=Abdalbasit|last2=Omer|first2=Nuha|last3=Al|first3=El Mugdad|first4=Mohammed|last4=Mokhtar |date=2014-09-09|title=Chemical Reactions Taken Place During deep-fat Frying and Their Products: A review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270727167_Chemical_Reactions_Taken_Place_During_deep-fat_Frying_and_Their_Products_A_review|journal=Sudan University of Science & Technology SUST Journal of Natural and Medical Sciences|volume=Supplementary issue|pages=1\u201317|via=}}</ref>\n\nOverheating or over-using the frying oil leads to formation of [[Rancidification|rancid-tasting]] products of [[redox|oxidation]], [[polymerization]], and other deleterious, unintended or even toxic compounds<ref>{{cite book | title=Household use of solid fuels and high-temperature frying | publisher=Lyon, France : International Agency for Research on Cancer ; Distributed by WHO Press, 2010. | author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | year=2010 | location=Lyon, France ; Geneva}}</ref> such as [[acrylamide]] (from [[starch]]y foods).

The arm must be medially rotated for the deltoid to have maximum effect.<ref>Radiography of the Upper Extremities: 24 ARRT Category A. CE4RT, 2014. 201. Print.</ref> This makes the deltoid an antagonist muscle of the ''pectoralis major ''and ''[[latissimus dorsi]]'' during arm adduction.\n\nThe anterior fibers assist the ''pectoralis major'' to flex the shoulder. The anterior deltoid also works in tandem with the [[subscapularis]], pecs and lats to internally (medially) rotate the humerus.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidAnterior}}</ref>\n\nThe lateral fibers perform basic shoulder abduction when the shoulder is internally rotated, and perform shoulder transverse abduction when the shoulder is externally rotated. They are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated) such as in rowing movements, which use the posterior fibers.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidLateral}}</ref>\n\nThe posterior fibers assist the ''[[latissimus dorsi]]'' to extend the shoulder. Other transverse extensors, the ''[[infraspinatus]]'' and ''[[teres minor]]'', also work in tandem with the posterior deltoid as external (lateral) rotators, antagonists to strong internal rotators like the pecs and lats.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidPosterior}}</ref>\n\nAn important function of the deltoid in humans is preventing the [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the [[humeral]] head when a person carries heavy loads. The function of abduction also means that it would help keep carried objects a safer distance away from the thighs to avoid hitting them, as during a [[farmer's walk]]. It also ensures a precise and rapid movement of the [[glenohumeral joint]] needed for hand and arm manipulation.<ref name=\"Potau\"/> The lateral fibers are in the most efficient position to perform this role, though like basic abduction movements (such as lateral raise) it is assisted by simultaneous co-contraction of anterior/posterior fibers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://muscleguide.co.uk/exercises/lateral-deltoid-raise.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625202454/http://muscleguide.co.uk/exercises/lateral-deltoid-raise.html |archive-date=2012-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe deltoid is responsible for elevating the arm in the scapular plane and its contraction in doing this also elevates the humeral head. To stop this compressing against the undersurface of the [[acromion]] the humeral head and injuring the [[Supraspinatus muscle|supraspinatus tendon]], there is a simultaneous contraction of some of the muscles of the [[rotator cuff]]: the [[infraspinatus]] and subscapularis primarily perform this role. In spite of this there may be still a 1\u20133&nbsp;mm upward movement of the head of the humerus during the first 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 of arm elevation.<ref name=\"Potau\"/>\n\n==Clinical significance==\nThe most common abnormalities affecting the deltoid are tears, fatty atrophy, and [[enthesopathy]]. Deltoid muscle tears are unusual and frequently related to traumatic shoulder dislocation or massive rotator cuff tears. Muscle atrophy is the result of various causes, including aging, disuse, [[denervation]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[cachexia]] and [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic injury]]. Deltoideal humeral enthesopathy is an exceedingly rare condition related to mechanical stress. Conversely, deltoideal acromial enthesopathy is likely a hallmark of seronegative spondylarthropathies and its detection should probably be followed by pertinent clinical and serological investigation.<ref>Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Chapter on deltoideal enthesopathy available at [http://www.shoulderus.com/ultrasound-of-the-shoulder/deltoid-ultrasound-entesopathy/ ShoulderUS.com]</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nThe deltoid is also found in members of the [[Hominidae|great ape]] family other than humans. The human deltoid is of similar proportionate size as the muscles of the rotator cuff in apes like the [[orangutan]], which engage in [[brachiation]] and possess the muscle mass needed to support the body weight by the shoulders. In other apes, like the [[common chimpanzee]], the deltoid is much larger than in humans, weighing an average of 383.3&nbsp;gram compared to 191.9&nbsp;gram in humans.

The arm must be medially rotated for the deltoid to have maximum effect.<ref>Radiography of the Upper Extremities: 24 ARRT Category A. CE4RT, 2014. 201. Print.</ref> This makes the deltoid an antagonist muscle of the ''pectoralis major ''and ''[[latissimus dorsi]]'' during arm adduction.\n\nThe anterior fibers assist the ''pectoralis major'' to flex the shoulder. The anterior deltoid also works in tandem with the [[subscapularis]], pecs and lats to internally (medially) rotate the humerus.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidAnterior}}</ref>\n\nThe lateral fibers perform basic shoulder abduction when the shoulder is internally rotated, and perform shoulder transverse abduction when the shoulder is externally rotated. They are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated) such as in rowing movements, which use the posterior fibers.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidLateral}}</ref>\n\nThe posterior fibers assist the ''[[latissimus dorsi]]'' to extend the shoulder. Other transverse extensors, the ''[[infraspinatus]]'' and ''[[teres minor]]'', also work in tandem with the posterior deltoid as external (lateral) rotators, antagonists to strong internal rotators like the pecs and lats.<ref>{{Exrx|Muscles/DeltoidPosterior}}</ref>\n\nAn important function of the deltoid in humans is preventing the [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the [[humeral]] head when a person carries heavy loads. The function of abduction also means that it would help keep carried objects a safer distance away from the thighs to avoid hitting them, as during a [[farmer's walk]]. It also ensures a precise and rapid movement of the [[glenohumeral joint]] needed for hand and arm manipulation.<ref name=\"Potau\"/> The lateral fibers are in the most efficient position to perform this role, though like basic abduction movements (such as lateral raise) it is assisted by simultaneous co-contraction of anterior/posterior fibers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://muscleguide.co.uk/exercises/lateral-deltoid-raise.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625202454/http://muscleguide.co.uk/exercises/lateral-deltoid-raise.html |archive-date=2012-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe deltoid is responsible for elevating the arm in the scapular plane and its contraction in doing this also elevates the humeral head. To stop this compressing against the undersurface of the [[acromion]] the humeral head and injuring the [[Supraspinatus muscle|supraspinatus tendon]], there is a simultaneous contraction of some of the muscles of the [[rotator cuff]]: the [[infraspinatus]] and subscapularis primarily perform this role. In spite of this there may be still a 1\u20133&nbsp;mm upward movement of the head of the humerus during the first 30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 of arm elevation.<ref name=\"Potau\"/>\n\n==Clinical significance==\nThe most common abnormalities affecting the deltoid are tears, fatty atrophy, and [[enthesopathy]]. Deltoid muscle tears are unusual and frequently related to traumatic shoulder dislocation or massive rotator cuff tears. Muscle atrophy is the result of various causes, including aging, disuse, [[denervation]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[cachexia]] and [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic injury]]. Deltoideal humeral enthesopathy is an exceedingly rare condition related to mechanical stress. Conversely, deltoideal acromial enthesopathy is likely a hallmark of seronegative spondylarthropathies and its detection should probably be followed by pertinent clinical and serological investigation.<ref>Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Chapter on deltoideal enthesopathy available at [http://www.shoulderus.com/ultrasound-of-the-shoulder/deltoid-ultrasound-entesopathy/ ShoulderUS.com]</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\nThe deltoid is also found in members of the [[Hominidae|great ape]] family other than humans. The human deltoid is of similar proportionate size as the muscles of the rotator cuff in apes like the [[orangutan]], which engage in [[brachiation]] and possess the muscle mass needed to support the body weight by the shoulders. In other apes, like the [[common chimpanzee]], the deltoid is much larger than in humans, weighing an average of 383.3&nbsp;gram compared to 191.9&nbsp;gram in humans.

Due to this airway irritability, desflurane is infrequently used to induce anesthesia via inhalation techniques.\n\nThough it vaporises very readily, it is a liquid at room temperature. [[Anaesthetic machine]]s are fitted with a specialized [[anaesthetic vaporiser]] unit that heats liquid desflurane to a constant temperature.

This estimate is extrapolated from only one U.S. institution's anesthetic practices, and this institution uses virtually no Desflurane. Researchers neglected to include nitrous oxide in their calculations, and reported an erroneous average of 17&nbsp;kg CO2e per anesthetic. However, institutions that utilize some Desflurane and account for nitrous oxide have reported an average of 175\u2013220&nbsp;kg CO2e per anesthetic.

In addition to [[global warming potential]]s, drug potency and fresh gas flow rates must be considered for meaningful comparisons between anesthetic gases.  When a steady state hourly amount of anesthetic necessary for 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at 2 liters per minute (LPM) for Sevoflurane, and 1 LPM for Desflurane and Isoflurane is weighted by the GWP, the clinically relevant quantities of each anesthetic can then be compared. On a per-MAC-hour basis, the total life cycle GHG impact of desflurane is more than 20 times higher than Isoflurane and Sevoflurane (1 [[minimal alveolar concentration]]-hour).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherman J, Le C, Lamers V, Eckelman M |title=Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Anesthetic Drugs |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|volume=114 |issue=5  |pages=1086\u20131090 |date=May 2012|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e31824f6940}}</ref> One paper finds anesthesia gases used globally contribute the equivalent of 1 million cars to [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sulbaek Andersen MP, Sander SP, Nielsen OJ, Wagner DS, Sanford Jr TJ, Wallington TJ |title=Inhalation anaesthetics and climate change |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|volume=105 |issue=6  |pages=760\u2013766 |date=July 2010|doi= 10.1093/bja/aeq259 |pmid=20935004 |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/105/6/760.abstract }}</ref> This estimate is commonly cited as a reason to neglect pollution prevention by anesthesiologists, however this is problematic. This estimate is extrapolated from only one U.S. institution's anesthetic practices, and this institution uses virtually no Desflurane. Researchers neglected to include nitrous oxide in their calculations, and reported an erroneous average of 17&nbsp;kg CO2e per anesthetic. However, institutions that utilize some Desflurane and account for nitrous oxide have reported an average of 175\u2013220&nbsp;kg CO2e per anesthetic. Sulbaek-Anderson's group therefore likely underestimated the total worldwide contribution of inhaled anesthetics, and yet still advocates for inhaled anesthetic emissions prevention.<ref name=\"Scientific Abstracts 2014\">{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=J|title=Estimate of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents of Inhaled Anesthetics in the United States|url=http://www.asaabstracts.com/strands/asaabstracts/printAbstract.htm;jsessionid=491932CB9B03D78ECF6AA62FAAA0C61A?index=0&type=search&absnum=0&year=2005|website=American Society of Anesthesiologists|publisher=American Society of Anesthesiologists|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Eger, Eisenkraft, Weiskopf.
